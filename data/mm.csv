幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Yimau Zhang takes us along for a ride to explore how things seem to have changed in China. The country has given a step forward into the modern age as it shakes off its rigid past, adopting new ways in doing things. In fact, the country appears to have developed its own take on capitalism, as we watch a new prosperous, and aggressive China, transformed in ways we had not envisioned before. Mr. Zhang's film is an allegory about his country.The main idea in the film is how Zhao, a factory worker, sets his eyes on a plump and attractive woman to get married. The woman, in turn, has her own ideas of what to expect from this man who lies to her and makes himself pass for a hotel manager. Thinking this is the case, the lady friend proposes he employs her stepdaughter, a blind girl that has been abandoned by her father, who has decamped to another city.Zhao, who wants to keep the girlfriend happy, decides to take Wu Ying to work at his hotel, which in reality is a bus, that he and his buddy have converted in a lovers' motel, in a park. But before he can do anything, Zhao watches in horror as how some cleaning crews are taking his livelihood away because they are beautifying the area. Zhao is stuck with Wu Ying, so he takes her to his own humble apartment.Zhao and his friends from the factory devise a plan to convert space in the dilapidated building a massage parlor so that the blind girl can work. The only thing, there are no clients, and only Zhao's friends are enrolled to tip the young woman using Zhao's own money.The film is a delightful comedy about how being entrepreneurial backfires on the well intentioned man. The blind girl, Wu Ying, knows much more than what Zhao and the rest give her credit for, and unfortunately, everything ends badly, except for the blind girl, who recognizes the kindness of his mentor, who doesn't get to know first hand of her gratitude because fate intervenes.""Happy Times"" is a charming film that works thanks to the light touch by the director. Benshan Zhao, who has been seen in other Chinese films is excellent in the role of Zhao. Jie Dong plays Wu Ying with conviction and Lifan Dong, is the stepmother, who discovers the duplicity of her would be husband.Recommended to all Yimou Zhang's fans who might have missed its commercial run."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Zhao is a 50 year old unemployed loser making one last attempt at finding love. He courts a portly divorcee, but keeps having to lie to pass himself off as a better catch than he really is. Eventually, of course, the lies backfire. Zhao tells his sweetheart that he is the manager of a fancy hotel. She responds by foisting her blind stepdaughter off on him, confident that he can easily find her employment at his fancy hotel.What follows is a funny, unlikely and touching relationship between Zhao and the blind girl Wu. While Zhao is terribly misguided, constructing elaborate deceptions to keep Wu ""employed"" at the non-existent hotel, he does these wrong things for the right reasons. Zhao does find love, but it isn't the woman or the love he expected.This is an excellent film and there are three big reasons why: First of all, it's directed by Zhang Yimou who may well be the best director alive.  This isn't a masterpiece like ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" but seeing the phrase ""Directed by Zhang Yimou"" should be enough to tell you the next two hours will be well spent.The second and third reasons are Benshan Zhao as Zhao and Jei Dong as Wu. Zhao is a respected Chinese comedian, but the role here is really a mixture of comedy and drama. Zhao gives the mixture exactly the right touch. But the real revelation is Jei Dong. I found myself wondering through the entire movie if she were really blind. She is that good. (And I still don't know the answer.)Don't expect a laugh out loud comedy if you see this movie. It is very funny in places, but frequently that humor is very uncomfortable. And frequently happy times aren't really what they seem."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"There is no doubt in my mind that Zhang Yimou is one of the world's finest film makers. He manages to straddle the bounds of both art house and commercialism with his catalogue of works that show a beauty and grandeur that often earns the description ""painterly"", whilst also telling a really good story. Happy Times is something of a departure from works like Raise The Lantern and Shanghai Triad, being a fairly realist comedy.Happy Times (""Happy Times Hotel"" on the print) is about a group of 'retired' (laid off) factory workers who conspire to hoax a young blind girl. Not as callous as it sounds though, as their intentions are relatively good. The main characters are a 50 year old bachelor (Zhao Benshan) and the blind girl herself, played by newcomer Dong Jie. A small crowd of interesting friends and the gargantuan love interest/stepmother of the leads pad out the cast, which mostly plays out in a couple of small locations - two cramped flats, a sprawling abandoned warehouse, and a delapidated bus.It's very much a character piece, focussing mainly on the relationship that develops between Zhao Benshan and Dong Jie, thrust together under circumstances that neither planned. It's a tender story... a little bit happy, a little bit sad. Bittersweet I guess, but only slightly bitter.Zhang Yimou forgoes his usual luscious cinematography for quite a naturalistic feel. Apparently he used ""hidden cameras"" to shoot some of it, but I've no idea what that means (maybe the street scenes?). It's quite a simple piece, a light 95 minutes long, yet still crafted with the dexterity and care that Zhang Yimou always brings to a film. Being a character piece, it is very much dependent on the performances for success - Zhang could coax an oscar winner out of a mannequin, but Dong Jie here is especially good. If I hadn't seen her walking around the theatre unattended, I would certainly have believed she was genuinely blind (this is not an easy thing to act), and her emotional expression is spot on too. You couldn't possibly not care for her character, or that of Zhao Benshan.The movie might be quite 'slight' in Zhang Yimou's filmography - it's unlikely to win any oscars for him, but it is a nicely made movie that I think everybody can enjoy."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"6 Stars! This is a must see movie but be warned....the description of this film is not what this film's about. It is not a comedy, even though parts of the story are actually funny. It is a fable about compassion and the amount of deception sometimes needed to achieve it, especially by the inept. Happy Times is directed by Yimou Zhang, who gave us the masterpiece The Road Home, and it is very moving and terribly sad and oddly funny. If you like being delighted and surprised, watch this one."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"It seems that most of the negative reviews that this film has gotten are based upon people's misconception that the film should be what THEY want it to be, not what it really is. The truth is, although there's certainly humor in the film, it's not a comedy - nor does it pretend to be a fairy tale, or a social expose, or a political statement. To me, it's a film about cruelty and compassion - both by human beings and by fate. I found it both life-affirming, and heartbreaking - often at the same time, and I thought the acting was excellent on everyone's part. To me, well worth seeing, and quite unique."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"The simple story of Happy Times overlays an interesting commentary on China's government, society, and future.The first act of film creates the characters, their relationships, and the overall situation, to set up the political allegory that plays out in the final two acts. The story unfolds that retired/laid-off Old Zhao must take care of the young blind girl, Wu Ying. Through a series of lies, Zhao has put himself in a situation where, although he is retired and poor, Wu Ying believes he owns a successful hotel. He offers to give her a job in the hotel's massage room. (This is not a front for prostitution. In China, ""blind man massage"" is available in most cities.)He uses the factory where he worked - which is shut down but not yet abandoned - and the help of his former workmates, to create a fake massage room and fake customers. Zhao also provides the money to pay Ying for massages, until the crew hits upon the idea of using fake money.In the old China, the state guaranteed jobs for everyone. The patriarchal and authoritarian government wanted to show off their glorious communist system, and how well it worked (compared to the decadent capitalists, with their unemployment problems). The government could always print more money, to pay these workers.The allegory is clear: Zhao represents the ""state"" - and its well-intentioned ""make work"" projects. The pride of Zhao (and his chances with his fiancee) is at stake, and he struggles to maintain the charade. As well, he finds that he cares for and is concerned about his charge, Ying.In the end, two things happen independently: Zhao finds that he cannot sustain the masquerade - he is running out of money and resources (and gets into a situation where it is impossible for him to continue, and, indeed, might put Ying in desperate jeopardy); and Ying, who cottoned on to the charade long ago, decides to take responsibility for herself, and seek her own fortune.In the same way, China's government realized it could not continue along its Maoist path, and its citizens (or at least some of them) were eager to be responsible for themselves, rather than relying on their government. A new path for China's people has opened, with greater responsibility and greater opportunity.The film's ending brings mixed emotions: we are concerned for Ying, who must begin coping with the world with no help (at her own choice, although circumstances would force this choice, anyhow); at the same time, we are optimistic for her future possibilities; and we are sad that the relationship of Zhao and Ying has ended.It is a tribute to director Zhang Yimou, Zhao Benshao (Zhao), and Dong Jie (Wu Ying) that the story and characters are touching, regardless of the underlying allegory. The movie plays well as the delicate and simple story of two people brought together by funny circumstances and human nature."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This film will either get to you like a death in the family, or leave no lasting impression on you whatsoever.  I'm among those who fit in with the first part.  Maybe family death is exaggerating but that doesn't matter, this is still A VERY POWERFUL FILM.  This film proves that ZHANG YIMOU IS THE BEST DIRECTOR ALIVE (as Alferd Hitchcock and Akira Kurosawa are dead). The best actor in this film is actually the blind girl (sure, she's no River Pheonix, but who is?) who always gives you the impression that she's blind (unlike some American actors in American films).  Yet she happens to know more than you think in the end (no spoilers on that).  To see this film on the big screen was too much, 10 out of 10.  Oh, and watch out for Hero, from the same director of this."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This is one of the most touching films I've ever seen. I actually don't think I can find the words in English to describe how wonderfully director Zhang Yimou seems to understand the finer points of human emotions. I was absolutely touched with Happy Times, and consequently sought out his work, ""The Road Home"", which I found was equally excellent.I wanted to wait to write a review of this film until I felt I could compose something fitting, but realized for me, the comments must come from the heart. In short, I'd rather skip any attempt to summarize the film or intellectually categorize it into some literal form that doesn't really fit. It is slowly immersing into unselfish love for another, while relating a sense of light comedy. My recommendation is that you try to see it on IFC or one of the other Independent film channels when it's available.On Golden Pond is the only American film I can think of that evokes the same level of emotion provoked by Zhang Yimou."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"No longer partnered, artistically or domestically,  with the stunning Gong Li, director Zhang Yimou has probably redeemed himself with Party satraps through his engaging serio-comic ""Happy Days."" (He's been in and out of hot water with past films.) Destined to reach a miniscule audience in theaters, this touching film ought to be widely viewed when released for sale or rental.Set in an unnamed Chinese city (definitely not Beijing), the story revolves around retired factory worker Zhau, just over fifty, and a blind teenager, Wu Ying, stepdaughter of the corpulent and avaricious woman the impecunious Zhau seeks as a wife.  Wu Ying, blind since early childhood from a tumor, has to deal not only with her witch of a stepmom (dad fled from her and is supposedly in a far off city working to send money to bring his daughter to him) but with her stepbrother, a bulbous slobus amoebus training to match his mother's nastiness.Zhau has a covey of good friends.  His first get rich scheme, hatched up with his closest friend, is to ""restore"" a derelict bus in a park to its pristine state so it can be rented for quick, hot sheet assignations (""Happy Times Hotel"").  Americans will find the Chinese take on non-marital, catch-as-catch-can sex naive but it reflects tension balanced by humor in a country where the citified young seek freedoms their elders never enjoyed.The core of the story is Zhau's attempts to take care of Yu Wing after the evil stepmom throws her at Zhau and tells him to get her out of the house and keep her out.  With his friends, all equally hovering near or under the poverty line, Zhau sets Yu Wing up as a masseuse in a fake massage parlor in a decrepit abandoned factory, the legitimate kind of parlor, not the type I heard about when an Army officer in severalAsian countries (Yu Wing was trained to give massages).I won't reveal the lengths Zhau and his gang go to in their effort to sustain Yu Wing and make her happy. Some of their scheming is very funny. The ending reflects, hardly for the first time, Zhang Yimou's skill not only as a top director but also as a talented storyteller.I've never seen the actor and actress who play the leads before. They simply blend their performances convincingly into a seamless story that says more about the possibilities and rewards of empathy and the joys of caring than it does about modern China.  The locales here range from an affluent downtown to a condemned, empty factory.  There's hardly any politics. It's sad, though, that a decent, retired factory worker can't spring for a 25 yuan Haagen Daz small cone offered in a shop that could have been imported from Main Street.Put this one on your to-rent list!!"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"There is, in this world, many parents, siblings or grandparents are, but they always angry, especially when it comes to their loved ones. His ""generosity"" is full of contempt, anger and I think that self-frustration for failing to more fortunate children or grandchildren or more committed to themselves. This giving is worth very little, because the recipient feel humiliated, and love is hate and what does not grow in his heart, first by himself, by being forced to receive from whoever stain, and second, that which gives because he knows that, at bottom, despises him. There is in this world, and fortunately, people who are eager to give and to serve because he feels playing the role for which he was born, then, when given the heart, there is nothing more rewarding for humans to feel that someone has released a fix or which has helped improve their quality of life. Being that really works, do not expect rewards, for the simple flow makes you feel full, and instead wanted to thank you, it is he who gives them for being in a state of abundance.The sincere and loving act of giving is an act of creation because it is spreading, confidence and hope. It is this that comes Zhao, a man old enough and who, wishing to mate with a plump woman conflictive existence, just knowing Wu Ying, a sweet blind teenager who, motherless and abandoned by her father with his stepmother, he began to feel that, this woman is charging the resentment what she feels for his volatile father. Zhao, take time to under the beautiful Wu and begin a long quest to get her access to the happy times, while getting to make sense of their existence. Yimou's film, soon to look at the classic Charles Chaplin ""City Lights"" but his personal touch and very oriental, manages the film with feel and certain charm, though - it must be said - without the immense magic and poetic warmth that has the now classic work of Charlot. However, at the end one feels that, with grace and wisdom, ""Happy Times"", has shown a path that gives meaning to existence, and so, well deserve our warmest applause."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"I am not too impressed with Zhang Yimou's sentimentality in his films with a contemporary milieu which I've been watching lately- but I prefer these to a couple of ornate reworkings he made (two or three in a row, if I am not mistaken) about Chinese woman's social conditions in the past, as a reflection on today's improvement or lack of it. ""Red Sorghum"" is still a favorite of mine, but I had to wait for ""To Live"" to see a different angle of his moviemaking. Though livelier in spirit than those period dramas, this one is based on a literary source and it shows, the more so if compared to the similar but free story of the young teacher in ""Not One Less"". Zhang concentrates on an old man wanting a wife, but his better characters are still the women: the blind girl with the open resolution of her character- is more complex than the old man and one wonders what she will do next; while her stereotypical stepmother and the only female retired friend of the old man are quite attractive and would also make good stories. A fine movie just the same."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This one's up to Zhang Yimou's usual standard, and like his other movies, revolves around an unfortunate female, in this case a young blind woman. Set in modern urban China, this movie often has a lighter touch than most of his others. Although the movie credits cite a story by Mo Yan, ""Shifu, You'll do Anything for a Laugh"" as the basis of the movie, the connection is highly tenuous, borrowing little more than the main character from that short story; namely, a middle-aged, laid-off factory worker, played by Zhao Benshan (best known to Chinese audiences as a comedic actor). The economic changes in modern China form the background to his relationship with the blind girl he finds himself thrown together with as he tries to court her step-mother.I'd like to see someone pick this one up for distribution and given a better English title."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"About a retired factory worker who plans to marry an overweight, unattractive lady, only to wind up taking care of her unwanted, blind but beautiful daughter. Zhao Benshao's performance as the cheapskate, retired bachelor is outstanding, while newcomer Jie Dong (WuYing) plays the blind girl to perfection.Another unhappy ending by Zhang Yimou, but don't let that faze you by this funny, touching and inspiring movie. Hard to find another movie like this one. 8 out of 10."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"OK... this was supposed to be a comedy.  NOPE!!!  NADA!!!  STAY AWAY IF YOU NEED A LAUGH.  This movie was really rather sad and depressing... if there was any humor in it, it was beyond me.  This movie angered me and depressed me at the same time..."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Zhang Yimou has long been one of my favorite directors not only for his opulent historical dramas but also for his some of his small-scale, intimate films. Though I did not care for his previous effort, The Road Home, I eagerly anticipated Happy Times since Terence Malick was listed as Executive Producer. Unfortunately, I found Happy Times to be a cliché-ridden and uninvolving film.Based on the novella ""Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh"" by Mo Yan, the setup for the film is implausible. In a modern unnamed Chinese city, a poor retired bachelor named Zhao (played by the Chinese comic Zhao Benshan) is engaged to a boorish, hefty divorcee (Lihua Dong) whom he met through a dating service (skinny women seem to ignore him, he says). The prospective bride (who is not named), however, is little more than a caricature of the evil stepmother. She has a bratty son (Ling Qibin) and a blind stepdaughter Wu Ying (Jie Dong) whom she wants to unload and demands Zhao give her 50,000 yuan to hold a suitable wedding. Through a series of lies, Zhao has convinced his fiancée that he is a man of means. To come up with the 50,000 yuan, he and his friend Li (Li Xuejian) decide to convert an old bus into a ""pay-for-play"" lover's rendezvous. Zhao must abandon the project, however, when the bus is hauled off as part of a reclamation project. After Wu is thrown out of her home, he agrees to hire her as a masseuse in his hotel. The only trouble is there is no hotel.To cover his reckless scheming, Zhao and his retired buddies construct a massage parlor in an old warehouse and pretend to be her customers. They even go so far as to tape record street noises to convince her of the authenticity of her surroundings. From there, things become complicated and a new lie is constantly told to make sense of the previous one. Was it Sir Walter Scott that said ""What a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive""?Happy Times starts off as broad comedy and has some engaging moments, particularly when the two friends renovate the old bus. Half way through the film, however, it abruptly turns into American-style melodrama with a tacked-on ending that is as artificial as imitation crab.Perhaps the film was really about people who cling to their illusions and are unwilling to see through deceptions, or maybe it was a political statement about creeping capitalism in Chinese society. Whatever it was meant to be, all of the trickery involved in deceiving a naive blind person made me very uncomfortable and I was unable to see beyond it. I am a sucker for sentimental stories about children, especially children with disabilities; however, I found Happy Times to be a maudlin and contrived film that left me wondering what happened to the Terence Malick and Zhang Yimou I knew and loved."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"""Happy Times"", a small time comedy out of China, tells of a less than successful middle-aged man who is desperately seeking a wife and finds a ""daughter"" instead. A lilting and sweetly sentimental comedy, this flick has a quirky kind of charm which defies description. I personally became completely bewitched by the film's simple, fresh, and unique style. But I suspect I'm the exception. ""Happy Times"" will most likely offer some happy time for sentimental viewers into neo-Chinese cinema exports. (B-)"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Another winner from director Zhang Yimou. This scaled down production follows a blind, headstrong young woman and the one kind person in her life, (a penniless stranger with grand, idealistic schemes to improve her life). Charming and very funny with the usual outstanding performances. Highly recommended."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Being a fan of Asian cinema, I decided to give this movie a go, so I purchased it from Amazon, and having just seen it, I can honestly say that I think something is missing from this movie. It is a great movie, but there is just something missing to make it that one notch more memorable. And I must admit that I had expected the movie to be more of a comedy than a drama about life.**Warning! The following part here contains spoiler to the ending of the movie.**Perhaps it was the semi-lousy ending to the movie. After all of Zhao's (played by Benshan Zhao) effort to give Wu Ying (played by Jie Dong) a purpose in life and make her life meaningful, he ends up in a hospital, and we don't get to know his fate? That was not very satisfactory to me. However, I will say that seeing Wu Ying on the street alone walking off at the end was just beautiful. It was nice to see that she was determined to make an effort and try on her own.The story itself was nice, Zhao is courting a woman (played by Qibin Leng) and ends up having to take care of her blind girl. But with little means and nothing real to offer, Zhao is put to the test. A test of the heart, so to speak.I found the acting in ""Happy Times Hotel"" to be quite good, and most memorable was Jie Dong. She portrayed the blind girl, Wu Ying, so nicely and so believable.""Happy Times Hotel"" is a great movie, a beautiful movie, just a shame that it started to fall apart towards the end. The movie could have been so much more if the director (Yimou Zhang) had opted to go a different direction. I felt that us viewers were left with so many unanswered questions to the story, and that was a shame, because it made the movie feel incomplete. But still, given the great story, then this movie is well worth checking out."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"In order to really appreciate this film, you first have to get over what will probably be some shattered expectations. The movie is described as a ""comedy-drama"" and I've come across at least one commentator who described it as a ""lighthearted"" comedy. I'm not sure what movie that commentator was talking about, but ""Happy Times"" certainly isn't ""lighthearted"" nor did it come across to me as a comedy. There are some humorous moments in it (such as Li lying down on the massage table and having his head crash through the hole because it was too big) but for a good part of the movie I was feeling somewhat angry at what I was seeing, and, in the end, the overwhelming feeling I was left with was one of sadness. None of that is meant to say that this wasn't a good movie. It was. I was actually quite taken with it. It just wasn't what I was expecting at first and it took a while for me to reconcile my expectations with what I was actually seeing.I said the movie left me with a feeling of sadness. That's largely because it was filled with sad characters. The movie revolves around Zhao, a lonely man who desperately wants to get married and who makes up a story about himself being a hotel owner to get a woman interested in him. The woman is a heavy-set twice divorced mom to a rather obnoxious son and the epitome of the wicked stepmother to 18 year old Wu - the blind daughter of one of the men who left her. She treats Wu like a servant and desperately wants to get rid of her, finally pawning her off on to Zhao, telling him to give her a job at his hotel. Zhao - carrying on the deceit - puts together a fake massage business (a legitimate one) and ""hires"" Wu to massage his friends, who finally end up having to pay her with fake money because they're all broke. Jie Dong was great as Wu, and Benshan Zhao equally good as Zhao.My initial anger stemmed from the deceit that Wu was being surrounded by. That feeling changed to sadness when I realized that - aside from the stepmother - no one was being deliberately cruel to her. Zhao and friends really did seem to care for her, and Zhao develops an obviously affectionate, almost father-like relationship with her. Watching that relationship evolve was very interesting, but it all led up to - again - what I found a very sad ending, as Wu leaves to an unknown fate, and Zhao is abandoned by his girlfriend and then seriously hurt when he's hit by a truck and we're left not even knowing whether he'll survive. So, yes, it's sad and a bit heavy rather than lighthearted, but still quite well done with very good performances from the two leads that leave you with feelings of sympathy for both because in the end you really do like both Wu and Zhao. 7/10"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"********** SPOILER WARNING ********* At first we see Old Zhao as an incompetent loser, in debt to his friends and unable to pick a suitable wife, while simultaneously bumbling his attempts to improve his financial standing. Ultimately, he is transformed by finding true affection and compassion for another. While there are comic elements in this film, and several very good laughs, the title, ""Happy Times"", belies its underlying tragic quality. A number of critics, both amateur (in this section) and professional, have described this movie as cloyingly tragic. With a set-up that includes a wicked stepmother abusing her blind daughter, this complaint has some legitimacy. But the truly poignant feature of this film is its focus on Zhao and Wu Ying who both end-up discovering genuine feelings for the other, even as each comes to a realization of the depth of their affection in an all too brief and isolated moment of insight. The ending is truly heart-rending. A very fine film."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"After China opened itself to the world in 1980, and especially after Tiananmen, it began a huge process of modernization to fuel the potential for its economic growth; however, everyone was not involved in this whirlwind of development. While many younger entrepreneurs were able to take advantage of the massive changes, many older individuals who were steeped within the system of government subsidized businesses and depended on the ""iron rice bowl"" for housing and food were left out in the cold. A group of these individuals make up the core characters of Zhang Yimou's 2000 film Happy Times.Noted for films such as The Road Home and Red Sorghum which show off the beauties of the Chinese countryside, Zhang Yimou also created films such as Not One Less and The Story of Qiu Ju which display the clash between the urban and the rural. However, Happy Times is different because it focuses entirely on the urban and the displacement some individuals can feel when their homes go through rapid changes.Old Zhao seems like a decent enough fellow. He is friendly and humorous, but has yet to get married. However, with the appearance of Chunky Mama in his life it seems that maybe he will finally get married, it is the 18th time that he has attempted to do so. The problem is that Chunky Mama desires an expensive wedding that would cost Zhao 50,000 Yuan or so: an amount of money that is quite out of his reach. However, determined to marry Chunky Mama he goes to his friend Fu for help and they establish the Happy Times Hut which is nothing more than a broken down bus where young couples can make out. Being a chronic liar, Zhao tells Chunky Mama that he is in the hotel business and that he is making lots of money. Believing him, Chunky Mama dumps her unwanted blind stepdaughter Wu Ying onto him. Having no true place for the girl to work, Zhao and his friends build a ""massage parlor"" for the girl to work at so Zhao can keep his promise to Chunky Mama that he will look after the girl, but for how long can he keep up such a subterfuge? While it was panned by many critics, in my opinion, Happy Times is quite a delightful film. Zhao Benshan is absolutely hilarious and Dong Jie as the blind Wu Ying is magnificent. Full of humor and sadness Happy Times contains some extraordinarily touching moments. A great film for those who enjoy Zhang Yimou's films or Chinese film in general."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"There's a whole lot more here than meets the eye. You don't have to be a friendless blind girl in a city of ten million to appreciate human frailty and kindness. Yimou Zhang is a very fine director and his vision can be thoughtful and appreciated on several levels. China is still exotic to look at from my American standpoint. The colors are garish and bright. The modern city bustles, the young are hip and making it where they can. The old worker's, many victims of the poverty and cruelty caused by The Great Leap Forward and other catastrophic Marxist disasters, are still searching for happiness. Now, in their fifties, they look about and their old factories are rusting, glass office towers are going sky high.I'm still not sure that the actress that played a blind teen is not actually blind. Either way, she's a genius. Her final scene, forsaken, blind, but brave China, venturing into the traffic. This is film-making."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Someone criticized other commentators with the comment that they seemed upset that the movie was not what they wanted it to be.  My problem is that the movie did not seem that sure itself.  It appears to start out as a light-hearted (albeit with dramatic undertones) flick, but in the last 15 minutes or so shifts to purely depressing drama.  Don't get me wrong, movies can mix up comedy and drama (another mainland Chinese movie --  Xixhoa (or ""Shower"") comes to mind), but his one did not quite flow in a satisfying way. On a completely unrelated note -- Are we sure that Divine is actually on the other side and not just in China (the mother/finance was a dead ringer for him).Mark"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Zhang Yimou is easily the most interesting director in mainland China (he has some competition from Taiwan). ""Happy Times"" is once again a film that tacitly criticizes China's unprecedented stride into free market economics by depicting the lives of people who are left behind, or who can't find their way. The blind girl Wu is surely a metaphor for China itself, as the end credits make almost explicitly clear - she is followed by the camera as she walks precariously through the crowded city, with construction sites looming ominously in the background. The true stupidity of Roger Ebert is apparent from his dismissal of the film as a crude joke - a blind girl deceived into believing she is a masseuse in the Happy Times Hotel by the well-meaning ""manager"" Zhao and his reluctant cronies. But Wu is aware of the deception from the beginning, and even knows the bits of paper they give her aren't real money. Yet she goes along with the masquerade because she realizes to what lengths Zhao has gone to for her. That Ebert missed this nuance is typical of him. The true humor of the film lies in Wu's not being taken in by the deception, yet going along with it anyway - the deceivers satisfied she doesn't know, the deceived satisfied that she does. The final minutes of the film, with the tape-recorded voice of Wu expressing her love and thanks to Zhao (who is unable to listen) are bittersweet and captivatingly lovely."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"(This review will discuss plot, characters and themes which may be considered SPOILERS.  Please do not read this review if you do not wish to receive this information.)Score:   5.5 out of 10""Happy Times"" is one of those movies that have good moments, but in the end does not amount to much.  It begins as Zhao, played by Zhao Benshan, proposes to a portly woman, played by Dong Lihua.  The woman requires $50,000 for a wedding.  Zhao is broke and unemployed but deceives the woman into believing that he has the money to satisfy this condition.Zhao schemes to come up with the money by renovating a dilapidated and abandoned bus into a love shack for romantic couples to share their physical affections.  He and his friend dub the bus the `Happy Times Hotel'.At this point, it appears that the film by Zhang Yimou will be a light-hearted romp of strange stories of romantic visitors to the hotel. However, like a splash of ice-water on a cold day, Yimou morphs the movie into a sentimental Cinderella tale of a blind 18-year old girl, Wu Ying, and her abuse by the portly betrothed of Zhao, who is Wu Ying's stepmother. Yes, there is an ""evil stepmother"".  The portly woman abandons her unwanted blind stepdaughter into Zhao's care, and Zhao is left to see to the girl's living arrangements and employment.Zhao reluctantly becomes Wu Ying's prince and fairy godmother in one.  Zhao sets Ying up to stay in his apartment and builds an imaginary massage parlor in an abandoned factory for Ying to work.  This is in essence, Zhan Yimou's attempt to turn a pumpkin into a magic coach to take Cinderella to the ball. Zhao even buys Ying a dress, as any good fairy godmother would do for a girl on her way to the ball, or in this case a fake massage parlor.The film continues with its fairy tale only until the jarring and stark real world conclusion that left me completed unsatisfied.The main problem with the story construction is that ""Happy Times"" tries to have its cake and eat it too.  It attempts to stick to its apparent fairy tale roots by failing to introduce the real world dangers of a blind girl who is abandoned into the care of a stranger and placed into service as a massage girl.  There is no lewd or lascivious edge as may be suggested by the situation.  Yet, through the treatment of the girl and the jarring conclusion, the screenplay violates our trust in this fairy tale world by abruptly reneging on the fairy tale.I think Zhang Yimou would have done better at the script level if he had dove straight into the material, as opposed to basically dipping one toe in. Yimou abandons the promising premise of the Happy Times Hotel and the marriage storyline in favor of the massage parlor/blind girl storyline. Why didn't he simply go with the hotel, the odd romantic couples and the comedic situations that could have followed?  Why didn't Yimou go with the planning of the wedding with the over-weight evil stepmother and the comedic possibilities that were available there?  Yimou introduces the material, dips his toe in and gives up.  What remains at the end is an uneven story of a blind girl and her reluctant savior.`Happy Times' is not a bad movie by any means, but it has the sad fate of so many movies of never realizing its potential and being average."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"We watch two lonely people meet and struggle and in the end, the worst possible events occur and I felt like I watched what felt like 3 hours for naught.Two sad, lonely people meet by chance, try to make each other happy but do the wrong things for all of the right reasons. In the end, they part out of misunderstanding and the audience is left at a cliffhanger not knowing what will happen next. Now I feel depressed.I don't know about you, but if I watch 3 hours of people struggling and then have it all end with a simple misunderstanding, it makes me angry and I feel as thought I wasted my time. Don't watch if you like happy endings! This is not a ""happy"" movie at all!"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Being brief, I found this to be a wonderful movie and story line. It is subtle throughout and has a simple but uplifting story. Some parts are funny, some just walk through the story and some are touching. It does have an unexpected ending that at first blush may appear to not be very positive but it is truly enriching."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"The fact that some readers confidently state the presumed political ""allegory"" of this film (which I frankly can't see) while others criticize it as if it were realistic (what? seven adults confining a girl to a massage parlor against her will?) gives some idea of why it's both interesting and powerful. I was never entirely sure what genre I was in while watching this--comedy? surreal fantasy? social commentary? sit com? romance? absurdist play?--and maybe because of that I never worried about the implications it might have for any of these, nor did I steel myself against its emotional aspects (why bother? it's just a surreal play!). The main focus emerges from this haze of characters and comedic situations about half way through. I'm told that some details early on in the film (the 'girl- friend' and her pampered, insolent, fat, lazy kid) are comments on an increasingly common family phenomenon in China; I wouldn't know. But once the focus settles on the main group of characters, I could not shake the notion that they constitute an absolutely dead-on representation of American bourgeois family life (or perhaps just those I've had experience with!) where each member, with the best of intentions, deceives everyone else in order to protect them from ... what? economic distress? emotional distress? And where emotions and love can only be expressed in the most oblique and often futile ways."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This is a comedy that tries to draws laughs from a scenario in which a group of nitwit retirees construct an elaborate fiction in order to deceive a blind woman. (The retirees, who are dropped into the plot without introduction about halfway through the film, are played by severely limited actors. ) Maybe the only movie I've ever seen that can be described as both cloyingly sentimental and unconscionably cruel."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Great directors deftly interlace humor with drama to create poignancy. Apparently not capable of this, Yimou Zhang does them sequentially. Result is a comedy that has some fine moments at first, but suddenly turns inexpressibly bleak and depressing toward the end. A very distasteful experience. Spare yourself."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"I saw this in the middle of the night on CBC; and bought the DVD so that I could see the first part.The acting is just amazing. It is a ""different"" comedy; but I would call it more a drama that has a lighter way of making a deep point; so that you do not realize how important the relationships will be. The purpose, I suppose is to give you more of an emotional impact because you just do not expect something so profound to happen.The movie is surprisingly magnetic .. particularly when ""little Wu"" is introduced and you can see the interplay as all the relationships develop. Also the acting is so brilliant, that you somehow understand way more then they present - so you can tell the history of the characters just by the way the actors bring out 3-dimentional characters.*Spoiler*** The ending, I really was not happy about - but the more I think about it, the more I am content with it. The original ending sounds better -- to me; if only to have the two main characters on the screen at the end. It is actually quite a shock as you really feel these two can heal each other.Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend it."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"I wish my films could capture the mellowness of Zhang's ""Happy Times."" The film follows a 50 year-old single man looking for love in all the wrong places. As old as that sound, ""Happy Tims"" makes it new again. Finally, he finds, what he thinks will be, his future wife. This very large woman as a son and a blind girl left with her, from her former boyfriend's former relationship. The girls father fled away looking for money. The woman wants the girl out of her home, so the bachelor takes her in as a worker in his fake massage parlor. This sounds horrible, taking advantage of a blind girl, but you realize it's mostly for good reason.The cinematography is excellent. From the beautiful country-side to the big city, Zhang knows a thing or two about cinematography. If feels like a classic Asian film. I think most people will enjoy this more than ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers."" It has this mellowness and freedom that other films don't capture. You feel the connections between the characters, and the Ending will rock your world.I only docked it because it's not for everyone. It's an artsy film. It's not Hero. It's not House of Flying Daggers. No fights. No swordplay. Just a raw bittersweet heart-warmer (NO! not a chick Flick!)"
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"I have seen four films by Zhang Yimou and this one was quite impressing to me. What impressed me was that the old man kept on lying to the blind girl called Wu Ying (Jie Dong) and they still kept a great friendship even when she had finally found out that he had been lying from the very beginning.The old man was intent on marrying the blind girl's evil stepmother and didn't get a chance to in the end because she had found out about his deception. I felt sorry for the old man that time because of the way he took it and ended up getting injured by being hit by a large truck.Despite the sad ending, what I enjoyed mostly was the friendship and the fact that the old man and his friends were working hard to please her in the difficult times she had and that she was even pleased to find that fact out as she hadn't gotten much attention before."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This movie carefully set up a lot of comic situations - an old man (Zhao), lost in his own denials of his incompetence, who is infatuated with a fat woman, and blind to the fact that she is a completely selfish money grubber, and in fact is lying left and right to try and impress her, because he has nothing to offer. He tries to make money by setting up a make-out room in an abandoned bus but he is too morally upright to allow the customers to use it. He tries to do a favor for the fat lady by taking her unwanted blind step child (Yu) and giving her a fake job at the bus (the ""Happy Times Hotel""). He loses the bus so he makes a fake massage parlor for the blind girl. All of this is very amusing. It is clearly a comedy so far, set in a Cinderella-like story.Maybe it's just the American in me, but at this point, I was expecting two things to happen at some point in the movie: 1. The old man would come to realize what a witch the fat woman was. 2. His charming, scam artistry incompetence would somehow accidentally make their lives better, because, so far, it hasn't really done much for anybody.The fat lady's greed and wanton abuse of her step daughter don't seem to have any effect on Zhao, inexplicably. We would feel for his plight at not getting the favor of the fat lady, except: 1. She isn't worth it, and 2. He seems just as culpable because he ignores the abuse. So, there's no sympathy for any of the characters except for the blind girl.Eventually, of course, we come to feel for Zhao as he comes to start caring for Yu. But he can't support her himself, he's nearly broke as it is. It is amazing that he and his old co-workers can come up with the amazingly complex charade of a massage parlor, yet get stuck with the problem of having to have paying customers for Yu. They just keep going themselves, and making fake money after a while. How does it not occur to any of them to try and get real customers? It would have gone like this - The fake parlor would transform into a real parlor. Wild, unexpected success. Zhao shares in the money, is starting to be well off at last. Shows off to fat lady, dumps her. Massage parlor gets busted (by government?), or they get evicted from the factory, losing everything they gained. Yu confesses to Zhao that she knew what was going on all along, but she was very thankful none-the-less. With some small savings, she sets out into the world and tries to get a real job as a masseuse, which is easier now that she has experience and a good reputation from her disappointed customer base. Zhao is back where he started, but now he is happier because he feels that at last he has done some good in the world. Happy Times.Instead, they continue using fake money. Yu presents a letter for Zhao to read, which is from her father, which hasn't been read to her by her evil step-mom. Zhao reads it, literally. It sucks. She asks if there's more. I totally expected him to make up something nice on the spot, something poignant and meaningful to make her feel better, and realizing that although he's pretending it's from her father, it's really from him. Instead, he fumbles and decides to do that later. Apparently it's so hard for him to access real emotions that he has to work on it. Yu knows her life with him is a sham, so she leaves, leaving him a recording saying how thankful she was. Zhao writes the fake letter from her father, but before he can deliver it, he gets dumped by fat woman, and is so upset that he gets drunk and gets hit by a bus. Neither recording or note makes it to the other. Super duper, huge tragic ending. WTF???? How about: He makes up a nice letter from her father on the spot, at the restaurant. He realizes later that he really meant it, but knows that Yu thinks it's from her father, and is sad to think she doesn't know how he feels. Yu leaves for the big city, but leaves behind a tape: I know that my father didn't write what you said, and that you said it from your own heart. Wow. Beautifully touching ending to a funny movie.It may be that Zhang Yimou can only do tragedies, (which he does exceptionally well), which is a shame, because the first half of the movie was very funny, with the characters and situations. But it got sucked right into pointless tragedy land. This was a most jarring ending to a movie that took a wrong turn somewhere in the middle.My advice is to stop watching it right after the restaurant scene where he reads the letter from her father to her. It just goes straight downhill from there."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Throughout this gem, the audience were taken along with the central characters' lives, first seeing things from the point of view of the betrothed gentleman, then sympathising with his girlfriend's blind stepdaughter! I laughed, I cried...the lows were pretty low, but the highs between were sweet and freequent enough to keep people transfixed."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Sony Pictures Classics advertised this on the DVD box as a comedy, but it's not a comedy by any stretch of the term. Now maybe it's a fine tragic film, but if you try to watch this as a comedy, you will be disappointed and spend 45 minutes waiting for the funny parts.I respect the viewpoints of the people who liked this movie, but Sony is clearly being deceptive in their marketing practices. If I hadn't gotten this from my local library (how shocking that it ended up there, right?) I'd feel like suing Sony for fraud.That said, I think China's non-mainstream movies are getting good enough that companies like Sony can characterize them accurately and still reach an audience."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"I rented this movie because I am interested in Chinese culture; I didn't really know what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only was the story good, but the acting was also very good.  I really believed the characters were involved in the story and I cared about what happened to them---the minimum requirement for a good movie in my book.  Parts were funny, parts were sad, overall it was very good.  I haven't seen the other movies by this director, but I will definitely look for them next time I rent."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"The story starts with a 50-year-old laid-off Chinese factory worker dating an enormous, twice divorced tubby. Between the fact that there just aren't enough women to go around in China, and the dearth of women that are attracted to shiftless factory workers anywhere, this nasty looking, nasty tempered women seems a good matrimonial prospect to him. To win her affections he claims to be the owner/manager of the Happy Times Hotel, which is in fact, an abandoned bus he rents to adolescents seeking privacy for trysts. The girlfriend's latest husband saddled her with a blind stepdaughter, whom she palms off on our protagonist as masseuse who can work in his hotel.The story becomes endearing when our man takes the 18-year old, it really brings out the best in him. He tells her that she is in a hotel and gets his friends to pretend to be massage customers, giving them his own money to tip her. At first he is clearly being kind so the girl will put in a good word with her stepmother, but very soon we can see his actions are selfless. He gives her his room and tells her it is hotel employees' quarters. He sells his television to get money for tips. When he runs out of money he and his friends give her blank paper, thinking she won't know the difference. All the while, the girl knows what the old man is doing, and plays along so he won't be disappointed. Through the picture, the girl expects her father to return with money to pay for surgery to cure her blindness, but in fact her father has bilked his ex out of money and left them. The old man hopes to raise the girl's spirits by fabricating a letter from her estranged father, but is hospitalized and never has a chance to read it to her. Before knowing that he is hurt, the girl ventures out on her own, leaving a tape recording thanking the man for his kindness. The transformation that the girl goes through is uplifting. When she first left her stepmother's house, she runs into the street, half hoping a car would hit her. At the end, she seeks her fortune on her own, determined to make it. I was pretty afraid for her at the end, venturing out, but freedom is scary sometimes. I really admire her for going.Some people's comments said that they had hoped for a different ending, perhaps with the two ending up in love. That would have been horrible, to think that this girl could aspire to something better than him. He's nice enough, but he really doesn't have much to offer. Another commenter said the movie is a symbol of the Chinese people living under the communist regime. The blind girl symbolizes the supposed blindness of the Chinese people, who know full well what the old man, who symbolized the regime, are doing. The play money supposedly symbolized the false promise of riches by the regime. The girl's going off by herself in the end symbolizes the Chinese people's eventual cut of the regime's cord. I don't buy this interpretation, mainly because the final scene is a real key to this interpretation, and this ending was one that was reshot when early audiences disliked the original ending. Anyway, I'm not sure ""Happy Times"" is the way I would characterize the relationship of the Chinese people under Communist rule. I usually take movies at face value and don't hunt for symbols, but I thought the girl's blindness symbolized the blind spots that we all grow up with. She refuses to see her father's faults, but in the end she realizes that malefactor that he really is. Finally seeing this is why she can go out on her own, the kind old man played a big part in making her see it. Very uplifting."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"It is a great movie... Yimou Zhang is one of the greatest directors on earth but one of the most overlooked talents. The world doesn't stop at Hollywood. Many great talents become overshadowed by the high budget Hollywood movies(and most of these movies literally don't tell ""anything"" to their audience). This is a movie with a stand, it presents a world-view and most importantly it is humane... It has a story with sub-texts and in these sub-texts, most people may find many details familiar to their emotional experiences. It is an intimate movie because it tells about ""the good side of the mankind that we all must preserve in ourselves"". I recommend it to everyone."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"This file is a definite must-see. I haven't witnessed many movies that are this touching, beautiful, and inspiring. I will not go through the entire plot, but I'll give you a rough sketch. An elderly man begins dating a woman who has a blind daughter who is treated very poorly. This man begins to show a deep amount of compassion towards this . The acting is brilliant, and the story is very touching. One of the scenes alone makes this movie, in which the begins feeling the elderly man's face. Happy Times is shot entirely in Chinese, which diminishes nothing from the film, it only add to it. I highly recommend this film. It should be everything you're looking for in a film."
幸福时光,Happy Times (2000),,2000,2002.6.26,"Yes, Yang Zhimou does master the arts of understanding human beings. For sure he knows how to make his actors perform at their best. Every actor seems to be effortless in their role that we feel like watching a group of 'non actors' in an everyday life situation. His characters are well developed and believable although not always efficient to the story (for a film that focuses on two people the number of supporting characters and even extras can be a bit too many). Happy Times can be clumsy and at some points even over simplifying (the build up of the fake hotel, the willingness of everyone to support Zhao Benshan's lame plans, etc), luckily the brilliance of the actors save the film. There are of course some touching moments that were beautifully  and skillfully done before the movie ends with a rather shocking turn. Happy Times is not Yang Zhimou's best work but it tells us that the maestro has a wide interest in exploring ordinary stories with depth and keen eyes."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Human feelings are universal whether you are a Chinese living in a crowded and vulgar country village or an American living in a comfortable and affluent suburban neighborhood. However, the experiences are different enough that there are subtleties in this Chinese film that only Chinese can truly appreciate.I never wrote an online comment of a film before even though I have read a great deal. Unlike most of other films, comments on Chen Kaige's ""together"" is surprisingly divided into two extremes: love it or hate it. Maybe this observation prompted me to write something to express my feelings during and after watching this film.I grew up in a small town in rural China, very much like the one shown in the film. My father isn't a ""vulgar"" peasant as the father in the film, and I wasn't a ""prodigy"" of anything by any measures either. The kind of strong character and sensitivity the kid showed is something I wish I had when I was a teenager. The incredible sacrifice and love the father showed in the film is also a bit surreal to me. In other words, my experience is much more real with little melodrama involved.However, the film actually made me cry when sitting in the cinema, not just because of the melodrama and the music, more so because it made me miss my own father and remember many small moments between us that are not so much drama but only our daily experiences.When I left cinema, I overheard a middle-aged American white couple in front of me making comments: ""a cute little film, isn't it?"" I can tell from the dialogue that they experienced different things when watching the film because they appreciate the details of ordinary Chinese life such as how the coal is used for heating tea. To me, those details are not novelties to appreciate, they WERE my existence and everyday experiences.I will stop here not to violate the IMDB guideline. After all, everyone's experience is unique. Everyone has their ethos deep from their upbringing and culture. I am just glad that this film brings me a Chinese experience of love between a father and a son that I can relate to."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I didn't have many expectations for this film having long since lost my patience for subtitles and slow-moving foreign films.  This film was a very pleasant surprise.  A beautifully rendered story about the sacrifices we make for art, the sacrifices parents make for children, and the sacrifices teachers make for their students.  I found myself thinking about the larger questions in life as I watched Han ni zai yiki--the struggles of the young protagonist to become a man, the heart-breaking dilemma that allows his father to become one as well, and the  ways in which we lose our ways in life, and luckily how the entry of a new  love (in its platonic sense) can get us back on the path.At its center, Han ni zai yiki is the story of a father and his son. Never have I seen this relationship told with such honesty and impact.  Instead of a perfect father giving pearls of wisdom to a son eager for his approval, we see an imperfect man doing the best he can for a son who  is not necessarily appreciative.It is sentimental, but that doesn't stop it from being thought-provoking, or from teaching the viewer something he or she is likely to have forgotten in this age of kung-fu special effect sequences and digitized actors.In the U.S. at least, we've been saturated with ever-dumber plot lines, plasticized breasts, and explosions to emphasize every character realization.  It's unusual to go to the cinema to be treated to a real story with complex and realistic characters in difficult situations that actually have some bearing on our lives.  Together was a breath of fresh air.I hope that the negative opinions expressed earlier don't stop anyone from seeing this film.  Although I'd waited four years to see the sequel to the Matrix, I'd have to say, without a doubt, Han ni zai yiki is the best film I've seen all year."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I really liked this movie.  I studied the violin for 8 years so I felt a strong connection to the film.  The story is a touching tale about a child violin genius who goes to Beijing with his father and finds the best teacher he can.  Truly the story is really about the love of a man for his son.  The father shows the deepest emotion and devotion for his son throughout the movie.  Unless your heart is made of stone and smaller than the Grinchs before it grew two sizes, you can't help but feel something for how much the son loves his father.The music in the film is a nice selection of up-beat, touching, sentimental and refreshing.  The emotion and message of feeling the music is executed with musical brilliance.  The pieces are played exquisitely and  even if your not into classical or violin you should still be entertained. I realize this film may not be for some people or if your not in a particular mood.  But if it sounds interesting you won't be disappointed in its poignant delight."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Here is fairly pleasant story of a 13-year-old violin prodigy and his financially-strapped father try to get the boy professional help to aid in the kid's musical career. The father is a bit on the pushy side but he has a good heart and he's pretty comical, too. The young teen is a likable kid and the other main characters - two of his teachers and the ""big sister"" - are all interesting people.The dialog, as with many ""foreign"" films, is different from what we are used to hearing in North America and I, for one, find it appealing. At almost two hours, this might be a bit long for most people to put up with subtitles, but I didn't find that a hindrance in keeping focused on this story. Along the way, you get to enjoy some excellent violin playing, too. People who like amiable-character stories and good music should enjoy this very much."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"He ni zai yi qi (or Together) is the stirring story of a young violin protege, Xiaochun, competing in the cutthroat world of Chinese classical music. Xiaochun's father dreams only of his son's success and goes to great lengths to accomplish this goal. Each character is developed and interesting and viewers will find themselves sympathisizing not only with Xiaochun, but with each person he comes in contact with. Director Chen Kaige weaves unique images together with a heartbreaking soundtrack to give this movie a definite feeling of realism. The acting by Tang Yun (Xiaochun) and Liu Peiqi (Liu Chen)is heartfelt and endearing. This is another example of quality Chinese-made cinema worth missing a few Hollywood run-of-the-mill flicks for. This is a definite don't miss."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I rent this movie because a promotion (pay 2 rents, take 3 movies), And what a surprise. OK, I don't wash to much ""Chinise Movies"", here in México people are custom to the American Movies, but renting these movie is a great option.Is about a kid with so much talent (palying a violin) that his father does practically everything to help him become a star, but he is just a kid and plays because his father ask him. The different people that the kid knows and the way his talent is absorbing friends to help him is moving. The music in the movies is splendid, characters and performance of actors are great, and let you understand the way people live in china in the 80's. Contains no violence or aggressive scenes, quiet good scrip.I don't know a movie that I can compare with this, sorry.I enjoy the end, despite my friend said wasn't good enough, but if you like music and a familiar movie, this is a must see movie."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"[See the IMDb page for this film for cast names.  Except for the director, Chen Kaige, who also plays a major role, no other actor is really known outside of China.]Reactions to Chen Kaige's ""Together"" are very mixed.  The story of ""Chun,"" a thirteen-year-old regional violin competition winner from the provinces who travels with his guiding, incessantly cajoling  or demanding father to Beijing for advanced instruction and a shot at an international career, is original in the sense that it's set in China.  But Chun's journey, actual and emotional, reflects the life of the child musical prodigy anywhere.Chun's mother disappeared when he was two and he was brought up by his simple but devoted father.  Correctly styled a ""country bumpkin,"" this obsequious pursuer of any advantage for the boy - for which no sacrifice is too much - reminds me of American parents I've known who, correctly or not (usually the latter) believed their child was a genius who needed to be nurtured AND pushed, no matter the psychical cost or the premature loss of childhood.Chun and his father have separate encounters and adventures in Beijing that meld as the story progresses. A young woman, Lily, who would be a perfect character in a Chinese ""Sex and the City"" series,  befriends the kid. A sometimes humorous relationship develops: she styles herself as Chun's ""big sister."".The budding violinist's first teacher, Professor Jiang, shares his untidy apartment with an assortment of rescued cats.  He brings the boy to the point where he realizes he can do no more.  Through the father's scheming, Chun next takes up lessons with the famous Professor Yu, played here by the director, Chen Kaige. Yu wants one of his two live-in teen pupils to compete internationally and, of course, the audience is set up for the expected rivalry.The ending is original and affecting without being cloying.  Anyone familiar with the American classical music scene, and I am, will recognize the universality of Chun's experience. The pressures put on young potential virtuosi, whether by Professor Jiang in this film or at Juilliard down the street, are enormous.  A kid's wish and need to just be a kid is fiercely subordinated to the vision teachers and parents hold for the young musicians.Perhaps part of the disappointment some feel about ""Together"" is that Chen Kaige didn't produce a sprawling masterpiece with the for-China daring political overtones that previously got him in hot wonton soup with the authorities.  This is a ""politically correct"" movie in the sense that it doesn't tweak the government's tail or the Party's (there's a difference?). So what?  Taken on its own merits ""Together"" is about parenting, caring, balance and its lack, ambition and the glories of music.  Many familiar and beautiful excerpts from the Western canon make up this film's score, often highlighting dramatic moments.9/10."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"The kid and his father do a great job making this work. The plot twist is very powerful. The musicianship is incredible. If you don't cry at the end, you're made of stone... I don't care how cynical you are.Movie does make use of several clichés about music teachers, but the funny thing is, a lot of music teachers are that cliché! And the classical music world is very political, as portrayed. And great musicianship IS a function of more than just fast fingers, as portrayed. The toughest part of this is how a country bumpkin learned to be that good in the first place. Who was his teacher?Anyway, I highly recommend it."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"This is a wonderful film. On the surface it's about a musically gifted 13 year old boy from the country going with his father to seek fame and fortune. Underneath, it's about hundreds of things. Just like Tous les Matins du Monde it's about music but also about how people lose the love of music through the events that befall them. What I notice about ""Together"" (He ni zai yi qi) is the theme of ownership -- how it eludes those who seek it in music. The acclaimed music teacher, Professor Yu, reminisces in class on how much he loved music, how his love of Vivaldi flourished during the Cultural Revolution despite the threat he was under. But now at the height of his fame he does not enjoy music any more; he only enjoys power. The boy's other music teacher has lost his love of music by becoming dispirited and his life has become decrepit. But the film has many other themes. It could be about the inarticulacy of adolescence, especially one burdened with impossibly difficult feelings. It could also be an allegory about China. I watched it as ""Together"" with English subtitles, but one sensed that in Chinese it had other layers of meaning -- the notion of the scholar as venerated in Chinese society, for instance. There are some things not quite realized and the ending is soft-centered, but the acting by the son and especially his father is gripping. It's a film that would repay repeated viewings."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I have just seen this movie at a press  screening here in Amsterdam and must say this was one hell of a movie! Hell in the positive way! Every time Xiaochung( my Chinese is rusty) ended his concert, I wanted to stand up and applaud!Story: 13-years old young boy travels with his father to the big city.The father has one goal: to make his son this best violin player. He tries to get him the best professor, but that is not enough. In the real world you need more. The professor realizes this but in China honor is very important. The boy thinks he has failed, but later on he understands. Particular the role of the father was wonderful. He wants the best for his son but hasn't the means to make it work. Xiaochung also discovers another part of growing.I very much liked this movie, maybe because I am fan of Chinese movies, maybe because I have been there. There is drama, humor, very good music and a piece of the Chinese culture in this fantastic movie. By the way, the movie is from the director of Farewell to My Concubine, need I say more?"
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"The positive things are all you can imagine and more. The acting is believable, the casting just right, the music is spectacular as are the performances, and the story is nice with a little surprise beginning slowly half way thru and blossoming near the end. Except for that there are no real unpredictable moments. The interplay between the story and music is accomplished masterfully. I remember listening to many of those selections as a boy and how the emotions in the music generated tears. The same emotions are here and yet amplified by the conditions in the lives of the people and the needs that drive them. You know the story: a peasant father whose son is a violin talent and who sacrifices everything to move to a big city so the boy can have advanced instruction and rightfully achieve fame and fortune. The boy's mother died when he was a baby and the only thing she left him was a violin, the same one he plays now and cherishes because of her. His talent is recognized by a master teacher who long ago has lost the woman he loved and has withdrawn from society with the exceptions of caring for stray cats and teaching untalented students - for his survival. There is a nice minor theme in the relationship between the teacher sinking and the student rising. A secondary theme develops between the boy and a woman he sees and meets at the train station. She is a man chaser and the boy sees beauty and fun in her beginning with an argument with her boyfriend who she kisses on parting. It turns out that she and the boy live near to each other and he plays violin for her. Because of her, the father wants to change teachers and convinces an up-scale teacher to work with the boy. The teacher reluctantly accepts; however, the boy doesn't want to leave the first teacher. Another energy to drive the plot.Negative things, which likely trigger the PG label are, in my opinion, minimal. The boy has pictures of women he places in his music books. At first you are to think he is a naughty little boy; indeed, the father accuses him so, and yet you realize eventually that the pictures represent the mother he never met. The boy is enamored by the woman he meets in the train station; he even helps her prepare a party for her boyfriend; and goes with her when she shops. The father gets angry with him; hits him, likely for the first time; takes the picture of the lady away; and the boy hits back, unacceptable in his culture. Also, some of the women are portrayed as mean in their verbal attacks and this includes a young female violinist. The movie should be fine for any child who can read or understand that Chinese dialect. I'd like to see it again and I'll buy the DVD when it is released."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"This is a beautiful, artful film that will move everybody, but unfortunately it uses every single possible trick to be a tearjerker for the average movie-goer. The music is fine, the acting also, no need to mention that the prodigy boy is especially skillful, but the father needs to be praised also. It is a shame that the director Chen Kaige misses the opportunity to turn the movie into a real film by using all kinds of cliches and escaping into the trap of predictability. Everyone who had once argued with their father and still has an issue is sure to cry at the end of the film. All in all, tasty, but not new."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"but very unfortunately, it is also a sad real life experience that is repeatedly experienced by many Chinese as we speak.The political atmosphere in China now is far more liberal than that of 1980's, an era in which the director's social criticism had to be concealed in the stories of pre-revolutionary era, however, the director takes a different turn in the era in which he can afford to be less cautious by eulogizing the humanities in the struggle of life and the most powerful theme of his works, the social criticism, appears to take a back seat. Nonetheless, the film is worth a perfect score for what it accomplishes."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Ignore the cavils of the stone-hearted sophisticates, since this is a mighty entertaining movie about a thirteen-year-old Chinese violin prodigy Liu Xiaochun (Yun Tang). The story traces Xiaochun from his provincial town to Beijing where he studies with two teachers with distinctly different approaches and personalities. Fans of classical music will be particularly pleased with this film, but anyone should appreciate the music. I was very impressed with how well Tang's playing was synchronized with what I presumed to be a recording, but after the film I came to understand that Tang is in fact a prodigy. What a treat.Kaige Chen, the director, plays Xiaochun's second instructor and is most believable. Peiqui Liu plays Xiaochun's peasant father with such straightforward simplicity that it is hard not to be drawn to him. Tang plays Xiaochun with limited dramatic range, but that is typical of a thirteen-year-old. He shines when playing the violin. There is a YouTube video of him playing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with great emotion, so I think his subdued performance in the film could be what the director wanted.There are some powerful themes in play. The ambitions of a father for his son and of a teacher for his pupil and the effects of those ambitions on the child are forcefully presented. Xiaochun is confronted with whether he wants to make the sacrifices necessary to pursue a performance career in a highly competitive environment or whether he wants to pursue music on a more personal level. Later in the movie some truths are revealed that help him make his decision.The Chinese seem to have an appreciation for color and the use of warm colors here accentuate the sentimental story.As presented, the view of the old and new China is interesting. Xiaochun and his father live in poor surroundings and his father works at several low-end jobs. On the other hand, Xiaochun's second teacher lives in an upscale apartment just like you would find in any major Western city. This film has a certain travelogue aspect to it for a non-Chinese."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"After watching an advanced screening of this film, the director (Chen KaiGe) was in attendance and told the audience that it was a film about individual choice.  In a country where the communist party has historically frowned upon individualism - a country where arranged marriages were the norm for centuries - individual choice is viewed with different perspective from one generation to the next.  China is undergoing continuous social change - some changes are obvious and others are more subtle but still very real.  This was elegantly captured in this film.  From reading other user reviews of this film, it's really hard to tell what others were expecting from this film - but they clearly missed a very easy central theme (or lost sight of it amidst tertiary issues).  Too bad, because for the viewer who doesn't try too hard to be critical for the sake of being critical (or read too much into the film), it is a wonderful film!"

There's room for love, for drama and even for laughing.

和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"In Together, a film by Chen Kaige (Yellow Earth, Farewell My Concubine), a shabbily-dressed cook Lui Cheng (Lui Peiqi) arrives in Beijing with his talented 13-year old son Xiaochun (Tang Yun), a violin prodigy, to look for a proper teacher to nurture his son's career. The beleaguered father soon discovers, after his son places fifth in a competition to enter a prestigious music school, that the top prizes only go to the wealthiest students. After much bargaining, Cheng finally secures the services of a music teacher, Professor Jiang (Wang Ziwen). Jiang, however, is a reclusive eccentric who lives by himself with only his stray cats for companionship and is unconcerned with preparing his students for international competition.Xiaochun becomes infatuated with Lili (Chen Hong), a good-natured prostitute he met at the train station. She pays him to play the violin for her but the relationship only leads to a family crisis that further complicates things for Xiaochun and his dad. At a Beijing concert hall, Cheng watches a young violin student trained by Professor Yu (Chen Kaige) gain the approval of the audience, prompting him to think he has finally found a teacher who can make his son a star. The two music teachers represent perhaps the growing dichotomy in China between classical Chinese tradition and Western values and, if this is the case, it is obvious which side the film is on. Ultimately, Xiaochun must choose between being true to his best instincts or disappointing his father, a choice that is made more poignant by a stunning disclosure late in the film. While it is true that parents in China are increasingly coming to the cities to seek a way out of rural poverty, the premise is not translated into a film that is very persuasive, floundering in a sea of sentimentality without any historical context or authenticity of time and place. The boy plays the violin with deep emotion but otherwise walks through the film with the same blank expression, and the father can charitably be described as a Chinese version of Roberto Begnini. Although Together is about playing the violin, there is no trial and error, any long hours of practice or insight into the ups and downs of what it takes to learn to play an instrument. Xiaochun talents are fully formed and he performs each bravura solo as if he was ready for Carnegie Hall. Beyond that however, the director seems to be saying that for an artist to succeed in modern China, he must relinquish his integrity. Mr. Kaige should look in the mirror. For a film that emphasizes the choice one has to make between art and commerce, he has made the wrong one, producing a slick, glossy product that will have wide audience appeal but lacks the ring of truth."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"`Together' is a Chinese film about a 13-year-old violin prodigy and his father, who travel to Beijing to find the boy the best mentor their money can buy.  While there, they meet a number of colorful characters, including a dissolute music teacher who's nursing a broken heart, and a hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold who befriends the youngster.Although in broad outline `Together' reads a bit like a soap opera, the superb actors and the director's sly way with a plot device and a characterization make the film feel less clichéd and stereotypical than it might otherwise have been.  Thanks to some adroit filmmaking, there's more a sense of life than of plot devices being played out here.  The filial relationship between father and son is warmly and fully developed, with much of what passes between them being implied and unspoken.  The teacher and the prostitute also feel more fully rounded than they otherwise might in lesser hands.  Part of the fun lies, also, in all the little details we get to see of daily life in Beijing. `Together' is, ultimately, a rather slight film, but it has feeling and heart and isn't ashamed to wear those qualities on its sleeve."

In my opinion, the film allow us to think about live, in many ways (economics, love, family, success, frustrations and purposes...etc...) using simple but emotionally deep scenes, where people's best is shown..On the other hand, beyond performances and script, how music is related to personages and scenes is absolutely amazing...From my humble point of view, one of the best cinema art expressions i've ever seen, taking into account what cinema is : a balanced relation between an history, images, light, music and emotions..."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"""Music without emotion is like a gun without bullets,"" says Professor Yu to young violinist Liu Xiaochun. And that's what this film is: a study of emotion, music, and the relationships that bring music and emotion together.The story revolves around a son's relationship to his father, as his father takes the boy to Beijing to become rich and famous as a violinist. The boy, Liu Xiaochun, played by Yun Tang, seems to have all odds against him: a peasant's background, a careless teacher (Prof. Jiang, played well by Zhiwen Wang), and a troubled young woman (Lili, played by Hong Chen). The boy seeks to overcome these odds with the help of his father, played by Peiqi Liu, who puts forth the best performance in the film.The film carries with it a sort of ""fairy-tale"" atmosphere that celebrates music and family. The music played in the film is indeed beautiful, and the highlights of the film occur in scenes where wonderful classical music is played. The direction by Kaige Chen is also very good, especially in one particular scene in the train station near the end of the film.Nevertheless, where Chen succeeds as director, he fails as a writer. As you may be able to see from the quote I have placed at the beginning of this review, the screenplay, written by Chen and Xiao Lu Xue, is full of generic material, mixed with some Americanization, which is frustrating because most people watch foreign films to escape familiarity. Although the acting of Wang and Liu is superb, the acting on the parts of the other characters is not always so solid, and that fact may be due to the poor screenplay with which they are forced to work. Furthermore, the fairy-tale atmosphere, although suitable, takes away from some of the films ""should-be"" powerful reality, especially in relation to the conflicts in the film.Overall, though, this one is worth your time, although it's sad that the most powerful moments in the film are derived from music written centuries ago.Final Grade: B."

However, that person's comparison to ""Stella Dallas"" to misleading; like all truly fine movies, the greatness of ""Together"" cannot be reduced to a mere plot outline.Extremely well-written, the script is realized by an ensemble of captivating actors; the nuances of daily life in modern Beijing surprise and fascinate. The central character is a 13-year-old violin prodigy, and if you love music -- and the qualities essential to fine musicianship -- this jewel of a film will delight.  I was taken to it by a friend who had seen it twice already in the previous 10 days, but she was determined that I not miss this film. I'm in her debt."

和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Together is a Chinese film about a father, Cheng (Peiqi Liu) and his son, Xiaochun (Yun Tang), a violin prodigy. They hail from a poor village, but Xiaochun is so talented that Cheng risks all of their meager savings on taking the boy to Beijing to find him a teacher worthy of his talents. Once there, they encounter the crotchety but honest tutor Professor Jiang (Zhiwen Wang), who agrees to take Xiaochun in as a pupil. Slowly the two begin to learn from each other, but that's not where the boy's education ends; he also manages to befriend a callgirl named Lili (the radiant Hong Chen).Much of Together revolves around the unspoken bonds between people who come to care for one another, and examines the lesson of putting others first even when they don't want such treatment. Cheng is a comical character and so the story starts off lighthearted at first, but as the relationships deepen throughout the film, the emotions become more powerful and the lessons learned by all parties more poignant. There's also a great deal of attention paid to the violin and the craft required to play it well, which is all detail interwoven neatly into the story.The acting is all subtle and superb. It would be hard to pick out one standout performance, as they are all top-notch and right on their emotional targets. Despite Cheng's outer buffoonery, at times, he is a man of deep feeling and commitment, and it is obvious throughout he loves his boy. Likewise Xiaochun; a little confused by the big city and the temptations it offers, he nonetheless, when confronted with truly important choices, always picks the right one. Both Wang and Chen are also extremely sharp as Prof. Jiang and Lili respectively; even though Jiang is gruff and surly, we come to see that underneath he's a caring fellow, and Lili, while playing on the 'hooker with a heart of gold' thread, is still well-realized.The movie slowly builds in emotional power until the strong ending sequence, a violin performance by Xioachun that links the various threads of the film together into a deeply resonant whole. Together manages to tug at the heartstrings, but in an honest and effective way; it's a very, very well done film. I'm not sure how hard it would be to find it (outside of Netflix), but this is one you'd definitely want to track down."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"""Together (Han ni zai yiki)"" is close to being a contemporary Chinese ""Stella Dallas.""Even the well-acted wayward characters (a cynical, self-absorbed music teacher, a harlot with a heart, a cruelly ambitious mentor) are almost as stereotypical as the annoyingly devoted, self-sacrificing rube father who withstands the cruelties of Beijing in order to further his son the violin prodigy so that they can all understand what's really important in life.While the audience lapped it up, I found it all just too saccharine."

I love foreign films and this one sure looked like the sort of film I'd enjoy. Sadly, however, there were some serious problems and it just seemed, at best, totally ordinary and perhaps a bit less.The story begins in rural China. A proud working-class father has been scrimping and saving in order to send his young son to Beijing in order to receive further training on the violin. The child is a prodigy and has gone about as far as he can in the countryside. The rest of the film shows the steps the boy and his father make in the big city to secure the best teacher.This was supposed to be an inspirational film and in one way it was. The father was a great character and you really liked the guy. On the other hand, a HUGE problem is that the boy was practically a zombie throughout the film. This is really weird, as his great new teacher praised him for infusing emotion into his music--but where the heck was the emotion during most of the film?! Additionally, the boy's actions sometimes defied logic and after a while I really grew to dislike the little twerp. The whole subplot involving the kid selling his violin made zero sense. And, as for the rest of the film, it all seemed pretty formulaic and, dare I say, much like a Hollywood sort of film. Overall, I was not impressed and perhaps my score of 5 is a bit over-generous."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"The movie has a complex story line, but the complexity is no hindrance to the movie viewer's empathy with the lead characters. Indeed, it is a paradox-- complex yet simple. The characters lied on the fine line between stereotypical and unique, which made them accessible to the viewer yet mysterious still. The ending was very touching and dramatic, but the events that led to it seemed to be a little fogged. All in all, the movie combined the elements of accessible yet mysterious characters and a complex yet simple stroy line to form a very deep and subtle masterpiece that would only need the heart to enjoy it. It's a movie worth seeing for the family"

Oh well - there were plenty of tugging-at-the-heartstrings moments here, but there were also plenty of things I loved about the film - first among them the imperfections of both father and son, and the father's very real insistence on trying to do the right thing in spite of his own limitations, and I also liked the first teacher quite a bit - a bit of a stock character actually given some life here. Varied other plot elements were a bit too tidy, but the camera-work and performances (always good) saved most of those for me, and I'd take it over the typical multiplex explosion extravaganza any day of the week."

This is basically, or almost, a Hollywood film, told in a different way. The audience will eat it up since director Kaige's hands pull the right strings all the time.

The film offers good artistry in cinematography and music, earnest melodramatic sentiments, solid performances, insights into modern Chinese culture, some humor and a big dose of the warm and fuzzies. In the final analysis, however, the film is somewhat illfocused, lacking in coherence, and finishes with a beautiful but ambiguous conclusion.

The other student, a girl who has been very jealous of Chun, proves that their teacher is manipulative and less than honest. The teacher too has a secret to reveal and this changes everything for Chun.It's a movie which looks at love in a real and non-soppy sense. Where there is sentimentality it means something.What I liked is the way the peasant father, by just being himself, endears you to him so that your mind changes and you stop thinking of him as an idiot get to love him.Highly recommended."

Chen Kaige may be most famous for the political/social metaphors of his movies, but ""Han Ni Zai Yiqi"" is decidedly different.If you go to see this film expecting to see another twist on Chinese politics or vague philosophical mutterings, you'll be disappointed.However, if you watch the film with an open mind and no baggage about what kinds of movies you think Chen Kaige/Chinese cinema is all about, you'll find yourself pleased with the engaging characters and the simple story (with an interesting, if predictable twist).  The relationships between the characters is what drives this movie, not the plot or metaphor.Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie that's a little bit less weighty. ""Han Ni Zai Yiqi"" is a welcome surprise from the usual fare you'd expect from this director."

I agree with them, all, though I could have wished for a different ending.I am an amateur musician and appreciated the emphasis given to how important music can be in our lives. The great music that we her can transcend many things.The surprise for me in the credits was seeing who played the violin solos. I was convinced, and surprised to be so, that they were played by the lead actor, since the synchronization between the image and sound were so good, even to the point of vibrato. Usually fine actors cannot feign playing an instrument with any degree of accuracy. A case in point being Gerard Depardieu in Tout le Matins du Monde. He is a great actor and didn't seem to be playing the viol at all."

It will make you laugh and cry and the music will elevate you. What more is there to say? It's a nice change to get a Chinese movie that not all about martial arts or full of violence. Instead we have a good human story here, well written, acted and produced. It's a simple tale that is made splendid by the fine acting of the cast. Personally I wish China produced more movies like this, rather than those boring martial arts epics that all seem to tell the same tale. Human relationships and the decisions we have to make in life are much more interesting."

If I hadn't been with a companion, I would have walked out after thirty minutes.  Or maybe twenty."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Since there is only one user review posted for this film so far, and it is screaming with jealousy and arrogance, the proper way to review this film is to defend it as not only legitimate, but truly masterful.As an Asian, I can attest to a wealth of dramatic storytelling on the Pacific Rim that merely implodes with strained emotions, lacking subtlety and patient Aristotelian exposition (or even Eastern philosophical bearings).  This film, however, is a calculated presentation of subtle character elements and moments that substantiate, rather than expedite, the overwhelming emotions of the story.With reference to the earlier, hostile criticism, perhaps it is meaningful to describe for whom this movie fails.  One must understand, and genuinely empathize with, the process of bringing a work of classical music to life -- the emotional transferrence, the sacrificial nature.  One cannot, for example, hate classical music.  One must also not be so terrified of ethnic stereotypes, and insecure about China on the world stage, such that non-aggressive, non-violent stories are perceived as retrogression.  (It is noteworthy that, for example, these storytellers do not need to inflict vengeance upon the playboy who resold the fur coat.)  Or maybe more to the point, one must be a mature adult or, in any case, have respect for maturity.This is a brilliant film that all the world should see.  It does not purport to subvert China, nor does it purport to be China's calling card.  It's just a great story that resonates with the Chinese experience and then, far greater than that, the human experience."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I was expecting this to be one of those movies where the protagonist is a disadvantaged kid, someone gives him the chance and he excels...well I wasn't entirely wrong but it doesn't really go that way in the conventional sense. This movie really moved me emotionally and it is a stunning piece of work.Liu Xiaochun is a thirteen year old boy who lives in the country with his Dad Liu Cheng. His dad is desperate to show off the talents of his young son who has a gift with the violin and to give him a good future. Lui Xiaochun eventually befriends a woman in the city who uses men for money, though eventually shows a softer side to her, a music teacher who is poor and slowly rediscovers his love for music and along the way discovers what is really important for him in his life.There is something just really natural and real about this film. I felt myself tearing up sometimes, perhaps because the relationship between the father and son is really just touching but also real. Yes it is sentimental but the performances are just terrific, in particular from Tang Yun who plays Xiaochun with a sensitivity that just shows even when he doesn't say his lines. It's written all over his face.The music as well - the violin melodies were just beautiful. It makes me want to go see a concert to hear such great music playing.I'm just wondering if Hollywood could do a story like this and make it work. This is terrific Chinese cinema and just a great movie. Highly recommended."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"Although the cynics might scoff and cast lofty looks of disdain towards this beautifully crafted film, this is, truly, a lovely piece of art. It sets a background of emotion, the peasant and his virtuoso son, they overcome hardships, but eventually fail to triumph. Or do they?Much of the power of the film is lost in translation, the quaint quirks of Beijing Mandarin (English speakers, think of it as a Brooklyn accent to the rest of the US), although the protagonist of the film does not speak many words. A certain satisfaction is denied those who do not understand the language itself. True, the film is not as grandiose as Amadeus, but then again, we aren't talking about THE master himself, we are simply speaking of a heartwarming tenderness, a triumph of talent over corruption, and perhaps in a sense, truth over cynicism."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"After falling flat on his face at attempting to make a Western film (the awful Killing me Softly), Chen Kaige has decided to try something in between a Hollywood film and a Chinese film, or to paraphrase many a Chinese leader, ""Hollywood with Chinese Characteristics"".  It is a total success or a total sell out, depending on what you are looking for.The plot will be very familiar to anyone who watches Hollywood films or American made-for-t.v. movies. A child musical prodigy from a poor family comes to the big city with his father to try find a teacher, gain recognition and be selected for a prestigious music recital; obstacles come up along the way, etc. What is different about this film, of course, is that it  does not take place in America. It is set in China with Chinese characters speaking Chinese. This film is competently made and will work for the people it is made for - Westerners who like films with a Hollywood structure and an arty veneer (the Asian aspect of the film being the arty veneer) and the Westernised urban elite in China. Others, however - anyone who hates Asian films that ape Hollywood or  admirers of social realism  - will probably hate it and mark it as the point where Chen Kaige totally sold out."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"After having fallen in love with Chen Kaige's other masterpieces, such as The Emperor and the Assassin and Farewell My Concubine, I found myself completely stunned in the movie theatre at this half-assed film.  What made a great artist like Kaige completely sell out in making this movie?  It was dull, boring, and utterly unoriginal.   Several scenes were so contrived, that I found myself cringing--like the farewell to his teacher where white light is streaming into the room making everyone look angelic! There was no subtlety in this movie, and worse, the story wasn't even that interesting.  It seems that a great movie could be made about the relationship of a father and son, centered on music, the sacrifices that are made, and the pressure of performance, etc.   But this was not such a movie. Rent it on video, and rent other movies at the same time, so you will be free to switch it off and watch something else."

和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"spoilers to follow:the director knows what he's doing.  he's an idea of what he wants in the frame and how the camera should move.  technically, the movie is excellent. great composition, choreography among camera actors background, lighting, acting.  the pace is just right, and only lags with the musical montage.but my criticism has to do with the story and how it relates to the universe outside the movie (our world, basically).  first, the movie was much too sentimental for me.  I did enjoy the theme of desperation and building a future for someone else, but some characterizations were heavy handed.  the kid's final lesson with his first teacher -- the chain smoking, cat owning bohemian -- looked too hazy.  the lights and costumes suggested ""saintliness"", but I felt it was unnecessary.  perhaps I'm just too aware of how the elements of despair and hope were presented in the movie to achieve just the right balance.  ultimately I suppose my criticisms are irrelevant -- the movie is internally consistent and the tone is sustained and complex. worth watching but a bit of a tearjerker."

Still I dont know if it was the music, the boys toughts or the fathers feelings that 'did the job', but the movie really took a grip in me. An extra enjoyment was the environment it was set in, or rather the two very different environments. I found myself identifying me with several of the main characters, especially the father, the son and the young woman next door. And the music... usually I am not listening to classical music, but here the violin took me to high levels. There was something very intense in the performance."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I don't know where Chen Kaige has been since *Huang tu di* (Yellow Earth, 1984), a powerful and artful work, and one of my favorite Chinese films -- and from the looks of things, Chen doesn't know either.  He ni zai yi qi (literally ""together with you"") is sappy and cliché-ridden, tired and uninspired and quagmired in its own sentimentality.  Chen was wise to cast himself as Professor Yu rather than Professor Jiang, the jaded, cynical musician-teacher, who has long-ago become embittered by the broadly political aspects of artistic success.  The allegory to Chen's own career would then probably have been too obvious.  This of course might also have been the material for a good film, but Chen gives up before he gets us there.  A couple of the actors -- Liu Peiqi (the father) and Wang Zhiwen (Prof Jiang) -- give it their best, but the painted-on tears in several scenes betray the performers lack of belief in the script and direction. Too bad.  Let's hope Chen Kaige finds again himself soon.  Right now he looks completely lost."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"So this is what is left of Chinese movies? Hopefully not, but this is a clear example of how a Chinese movie master can be led to make movies to satisfy the western taste. And ""Together With You"" becomes an annoying dejà-vu with fake characters and fake tears at the end. The plot is something we have seen lots and lots of times, and seeing once again, offered like it is a new masterpiece from an eastern Author is unbearable. The acting is generally awful, especially from Hong Chen, who plays the girl Lili. The music is good, maybe because it was not composed by Chen. Someone please stop Chen Kaige, the acknowledged master of ""Farewell My Concubine"", from throwing himself in the trash bin."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"An average tale of a country lad, Xiaochun, who happens to be a child prodigy violinist, and his adventures arising from his father taking him to the big city in the hope of somehow furthering his musical talent. We go through two different music teachers, both of whom we form some sort of attachment to, in their own ways.  Like us in the viewing audience, Xiaochun is impressed by the attractive Lili, the local girl about town who lives nearby.  Although she appears common enough at times, we grow to learn her heart is in the right place. The screenplay is definitely sub-Hollywood standard, with some less than smooth transitions between scenes, which I found a little off-putting. The positive from this film, apart from the moral which we reach rather artificially in the final sequence, is, of course, the music.  Anyone with an ear for the violin will come away with that as a definite plus."

和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"That's exactly it, in a nutshell -- this seemingly engaging, very well done movie unfortunately lacks authenticity, just as the previous commenter said.For all of its virtues, this is a sentimental, slick, commercialized movie aimed at a Western market.  It looks as though it was explicitly designed to generate hard currency.  Good foreign (non-U.S.) movies have humanity and make thoughtful statements about their culture, but this one looks like it's content to skim the surface, just like a typical feel-good Hollywood flick. Fine production values, interesting locations, generally good acting (except for the caricature-peasant father), but a very muddled set of artistic intentions.  Far superior to a typical US movie, but it could have been much better if it followed its own advice about playing from the heart. Ironically, this cautionary tale about the dangers of materialistic strivings doesn't seem to heed its own advice."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"This film suffers in the same respect as TEMPTRESS MOON does, a lack of cohesiveness. The film acts like a mash of cinematic moments compelling connection to each other. The very basic plot structure seems to be thrown together on the fly and real emotion is completely lacking in the formulas the audience is made to endure. After seeing this film and have it try and so clumsily grab for some sort of father son emotional chemistry one is left wondering, what was the point of that? One of the main characters, Professor Jiang, is completely useless. *SPOILER* And then why in the world would this character, who really did nothing for our protagonist, Liu Xiaochun, be in the final (and worst) scene in the Beijing Bei Train Station? The relationships were entirely unconvincing and were not helped by Yun Tang's non-acting. Other than his violin playing, which was admittedly impressive, all he did in his acting was recite lines like so much wood and throw out a few tears here and there. While there is good underacting out there, this is not an example.Then there was his father, Liu Cheng, whose character flops between a bumbling source of comic relief to the heroic father. There was nothing about the way it was done that made me want to suspend my disbelief. Moreover halfway through Chen Kaige throws himself into the mix, squashing all the previous plot development, with his own role as the strict ego-maniacal professor, presumably to satisfy his own egomania. There's nothing like sitting through a few scenes of Chen Kaige with a fancy photo of Chen Kaige behind him. My advice is this film is best avoided. Instead check out Chen's earlier, and much better, work such as YELLOW EARTH & FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"I think that this movie was a very full on reflection of a typical Chinese parent. I myself have experienced elements of the same story, like many many other Chinese/Asian people as kids.Most non-Asian viewers (not meant as a racist comment) who have not experienced the like of what this boy went trhough would probably not have been moved very much by this film.I personally think it was detailed enough in portraying the life of the characters in the film, while also communicating the touching musical sides. I think the film was well balanced: use of time was quite effective and the characters developed adequately. However for me it lacked a bit of dialog, I do understand however this may have been one point of Cheng.I liked it a lot as it really shouts out what many many many Chinese, especially kids - want to say. It can be compared with other stories of emotion versus success, like many Hollywood works. This film may even be considered a tear jerker - a pathetic attempt My bottom line is that this film is excellent for most people. Even if it isn't moving and as inspirational as one may want it, it can also be a reminder, to Asian parents in particular..."

The characters were likeable--it would be fun to have tea with Professor Jiang or go shopping with Mimi--even if they were not complex. The music was amazing.  At times I held my breath in watching Chun's performance of the more complicated pieces.  It's incredible to be able to get sounds that move one's soul from nothing more than a couple of pieces of wood and some cat gut. And, although I knew how the story would end, I was surprised at the twist that was used to get to that ending."

和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"God awful melodrama that would torpedo the career of any Western auteur regardless of his/her previous accomplishments. But the market is China, where Jin Yong, a kung-fu pulp-fiction master, is worshipped for profundity; and the audience is Chinese, for whom anti-intelletualism is at present the order of the day, and feel-goodism the mantra of ""artistic"" creation.The one-penny question is: what the hell is Chen thinking? If he tried to capture a bigger segment of the market and turn a profit, the Chinese passion for pirated copies would have made his efforts futile. Maybe Chen is a great humorist who is making fun of the cheap pulp sentiments of Chinese mass. But it seems beyond human ability for a erst-while great director to keep a straight face throughout this rubbish.Or maybe Chen is the greatest artistic poseur who has ever lived, who faked greatness in spite of his innate commercial vulgarity. But how could one say this about the maker of ""Grand Parade"", one of the truly humanist films that my unfortunate homeland ever makes, and the master behind ""Emperor and Assasin"", a flawed film yet filled with imaginative psychological plausibility?"

It's not the cliche that it looks like, but rather a great journey down only what seems like a well-beaten path. TOGETHER makes you want to call your father and remind him just how much you love him (as well as regret that you don't play violin!)  Dressed in chinese costume accentuated with american objectives, this is a tale of love that transcends culture.  Go buy this film."
和你在一起,Together with You (2002),,2002,2003.05.30,"A masterpiece of Chinese films. Don't know why the movie is so criminally underrated. It can beat many Oscar winning movies with its complex story of humaneness; with twist and powerful acting; with dreams and understanding of reality.Director Kaige Chen showed his power with his previous films, with this one he proved it again. Especially liked the music composition of the movie. The composition of Vivaldi was used sublimely.The unspoken words of the peasant father and the son could be understood by their expressions.No big budget, no special effect, no complicated camera work; even so it touches depth of humanity.Maybe it can remind us how much our fathers can sacrifice for us; we understand it or not. You don't have to be Chinese to appreciate the subtext of this masterpiece.Strongly recommended."

The violin music is exquisite. We highly recommend this movie to anyone with a beating heart and love of life. The purpose of a story or movie is supposed to be to alter your perceptions of the world a little bit, to leave you changed after participating in the story. Unfortunately most Hollywood movies fail miserable at the task, it seems that their main purpose is to impress themselves. If you like this movie, we recommend ""The road home"", another example of fine movie-making from China."

I think it shows the description of one's own life in a simple and quite interesting way, in the perspective of following the objective of a lifetime, but also having to deal with switching lifestyles. Sometimes, having to travel or leaving our beloved home to achieve this goal.To apply these important lessons, when you watch the movie pay attention to the teachings each professor gives to the boy. They are real important for anyone who wishes to succeed in life. In this sense, identify how you can use them in your own context.Remember, accept your own mistakes, and do not blame others for them!"

(He also plays the part of Xiaochun's rival, Tang Rong.) He was 22 when he recorded this score. A Chinese musical prodigy, Babeli began studying violin when he was only 3-years-old. His beautiful tone is an absolute wonder to listen to, and you may forget you're watching a film at all."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.First, there are scenes of haunting beauty(""Duel in the yellow forest"" and ""Turquoise autumn"" to site a couple) that, like the best of impressionist paintings, are so affecting that you will forever see the world in a slightly different way having once beheld them.Secondly, the overall message of the film is a provocative one. The claim is that a degree of human casualties and suffering may be the optimal path to a better world, especially when the alternative is equally brutal chaos. This is not a popular theme. It has become much more fashionable to be anti-war in all cases. And understandably so, since variations of this logic have often been used in the past to justify atrocities. But the film provides a crisp litmus test for avoiding delusion: action must be taken with a heart void of malice and an unwavering commitment to the broadest possible ultimate outcome of good for all. Can anyone live up to this standard? Several characters in the movie do, each in their own way. If the standard could be met, would the world be a better place? These are questions worth reflecting on that have not been dealt with, to this depth, in any film I'm aware of."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people, was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.Overall, I didn't think the story was that appealing except for the good message at the end, about the good of all being more important than satisfying one's personal vengeance. Well, who could argue with that? As for the rest, perhaps being a Westerner unfamiliar with Eastern culture, it's harder for me to relate to the mind-set. I would be interested to know how Asians viewed this story, as opposed to similar films.Sometimes I think these wild Crouching Tiger-like action scenes are too long and overdone, but at least in this film they were very original and, once again, more visuals feasts than anything else. On my second viewing, I discarded the subtitles and went with the dubbed version to concentrate more on the stunning look of this film. It paid off. Even if I don't quite follow everything, each scene is such eye-candy that you can't go wrong viewing this."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects, unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do ""real"" martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be ""backlash syndrome"" as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between ""incredible"" and ""awful"" as hype waves ruined the experience for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative and effective - just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"There have been comparisons to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, these comparisons are perhaps inevitable, some say Crouching Tiger is superior, some say this is superior. I am not going to say which I prefer, both are masterpieces in their own way. The story is very gripping and diverting. While there are the underlying themes of love, betrayal and loyalty, there is one big theme that is explored very well even if a tad surprising, the defence of totalitarianism against the chaos and insecurities of freedom. As good as Jet Li is, as thoughtful the script is, as haunting the music is, as intriguing the characters are and as fine the direction is, it is the visuals and choreographed sequences that make the film. The cinematography is ravishingly gorgeous and the scenery is stunning with each scene more beautiful and inventive than the one before it, and in terms of effective scenes the highlights in my view are the battles in the rain-drenched chess arena and autumnal forest and the midair sword fight above a crystal lake. In conclusion, a beautiful and memorable film and one of the best of its kine. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Before I give my review, let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.I viewed this film with high expectations. People were comparing it with Crouching Tiger and I really enjoyed that film. Within the first 10 minutes you understand why the comparisons are made. The cinematography, editing, music and special effects are similar. The stories, however, are quite different, and I found the story to be better than the one in Crouching Tiger.The story is about an assassin who concocts a plan to kill a king who had been trying to conquer his home land in pre-unified China. His assassination plan requires him to get close enough to the king to strike him dead. The movie shows the assassin's plan through a series of flashbacks, and culminates with the assassin getting his chance to kill the king.The beauty of this film is the how the assassin becomes a ""Hero"". I won't spoil how he achieves this, but that is what made the film great for me. It made the film more than just a visual and musical masterpiece. It also made it more than just a Kung Fu picture. It actually added a decent plot to the film which made it worth while. Honestly, I was just expecting a good Kung Fu picture. Hero is actually a great overall movie which just happens to accent the film with some of the best Kung Fu action in recent years.Definitely the best movie that I have seen this year. I hope it wins big at the awards ceremonies. It was impressive.-- DP."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made, Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies, it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the mise-en-scene and cinematography. That is, if you let the film take you on a journey, without pondering the films questionable plot points.Hero is two sides of a tale as presented by Nameless (Jet Li), a mere Prefect who defeated three deadly assassins, and the King of Qin (Daoming Chen), the man the assassins wished to kill. Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded.Director Yimou Zhang takes us through Nameless' story first, spreading the battle sequences thick, allowing them to take their own time. In the King's version, certain battles are then revised, which is remarkably brave considering that some battles are utter fabrications. In one such fictitious fight, in a faultlessly designed set, Nameless and Sky (Donnie Yen) close their eyes and fight out the battle within their minds. Screen time is being spent lavishly on showing how two characters contemplated a fight, whilst fighting each other in a battle that never occurred. It is confusing certainly, but perhaps Zhang wished for his audience to get lost in the plot's design so that they would not question the warrantability of half of the battle sequences, which make up most of the film.Yet, it is difficult to ponder these details when they are made so utterly insignificant when viewing such a spectacle. The sheer beauty of the battles, the gentle floating of the assassins as they fly around their arenas (which range from a forest full of orange leafed trees, crisp leaves falling down to the ground like rain, to the crystal clear and calm of a mountain lake), the costumes of characters at varying stages in the story line (red for passion, green for youth, white for truth, blue for love), the amazing army scenes which feature thousands of arrows being fired into the sky to create a black cloud that descends right on top of the camera, all these elements combine to produce a faultlessly perfect image on the screen, each frame a worthy photograph that gently reminds you why cinema is the greatest art form of the twentieth century.And characterisation is not lost in this beauty as one may have feared. Despite the irritating two dimensional performance of Zhang Ziyi as Moon, the other actors carry off fine performances, especially Tony Leung Chiu Wai as Broken Sword and Daoming Chen as the King. Their performances are especially credible as they are often drowning in the memories of the King and Nameless - they need to change slight mannerisms in order to reflect whose mind they are now in.The script too is of an impressively high standard. The moments of clarity that the warriors feel are experienced by the audience also, and there are some very informed outlooks of the emptiness of warfare, communicating that to achieve peace, sometimes war is the only option. These messages of course seem fitting in our current times, underlining how ancient some of the methods of our governing body truly are. Hero is undoubtedly a most beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.Rating: 4/5"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Two things interesting about this project. First, the sad news, at least for the Chinese, that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects: the theming by lush color, the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest (genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire, specifically in this case Japanese conquest - and adopted by the Chinese only since the war) and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story: it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters, the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings, and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space, and at the same time creating (usually three) layers of space. Often, he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action, but the space that contains the action. Falling water, dust, lots of blown fabric and hair, feathers, arrows, even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' ""Othello.""The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space: the game of Go, music, calligraphy, politics, and love. All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then, waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all, the camera is static, not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera, Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters, Zhang shows us not the fights, but the battles among the true worlds of the fights - the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game, or the imaged fight within it, or the imaged story Nameless tells, or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations. Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive (my war for my kind of peace), we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this, you really must see 'In the Mood for Love,' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here. It is one of the best films ever made and truly spatial in a purely Chinese manner. It will completely transform your enjoyment of this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"""Hero"" is a visually stunning film which tells a wonderful story. It is centered around three men-a swordsman, an emperor, and a calligrapher-who are incredibly passionate and driven. All of the main characters, including the supporting female roles, are easy to relate to. Although the story is slow-paced and projects an air of calm, it has this certain sense of urgency that will never leave you feeling bored. In this way it's unlike-and maybe even the polar opposite of-every kung fu movie I've ever seen.I was told Hero was the most expensive movie China had ever made (at that time), and in this case, the money went to good use. With its superb direction, cinematography, and soundtrack, this film will certainly stick out among the typically fast-paced, action-heavy films from China. One thing that will stand out about this film is its use of color, which many of its reviewers rightfully praised. Without spoiling anything, how color is used to tell this story is both visually beautiful and psychologically intriguing. Combined with its incredible soundtrack, it will very likely have artistically-inclined viewers agape and speechless. In the very least, ""Hero"" is a feast for the senses-like a fireworks show of color and sound. At its best, it is a wonderful story about nationalism, self-examination, and love which is told in an unusually beautiful fashion.As many will tell you, if you liked ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", you're likely to enjoy this just as much-especially if you liked the quieter, more introspective scenes in that film. Because there is so little to compare it to, ""Hero"" is a difficult film to review. However, that only gives you another reason to give it a chance. And finally, it must be said that this is Jet Li at his very best."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw-droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline, the delicate direction of the sword slicing action, the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement. This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but is far, far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done, just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other, defying the laws of physics as we know it, and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other, at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set, with hundreds of thousands of the King's warriors in formation, simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky, in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you, as the audience, to become firmly engrossed in your seat. The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious, vivid, bright, wind-blown,draped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention, as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed. This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times, especially in today's American-lead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything - including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS. This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out 'Ong Bak', but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"A visually stunning masterpiece. It's just beautiful, everyone involved are top of their field and it shows. The colours, the music, the sets, the costumes, the martial arts, the acting all breathtaking."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"In all honesty, Hero required a bit more patience than I thought. Tarantino wanted to present this movie to North American audiences so I thought there would have been more action, but surprise! There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?Anyway, a man who shall remain Nameless has dispatched the kingdom's three top assassins, thus easing the King's mind that he could sleep at night. But the King is curious and we see the true story and how the tale unfolds.The fights are beautiful. The battle between Snow and Moon, though lopsided, was a joy. It was art in itself. But overall, be patient. With the many changes in the story, I lost my concentration adjusting to it. But any fan of martial arts and drama must see this movie. It is that elegant."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"While i enjoyed this movie very much, i believe Hero will get the kinds of reviews and responses that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (CTHD) did, and still does, ie. either you liked it very much, or you couldn't see what the fuss was all about.  This dichotomy of opinions makes for interesting study because it seems to cut across cultural and intellectual differences. Everywhere the film is shown, there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it, and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.  I can't explain why this is so, but i suspect it has a lot to do with a viewer's initial expectation of the movie, and then his perception and appreciation of the nuances in the telling of the storyline.Hero is a film that is beautiful in many aspects.  The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious.  Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself.  The language spoken is traditional mandarin, but oh, so easy to the ear, even though i couldn't understand every word. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but i could be mistaken).  The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor.  Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so i think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.  The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action.  Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination.  The music, though quite similar to that in CTHD, is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.I went to the cinema having heard some of the hype leading to the movie, but with no real knowledge of the storyline, and not expecting a lot.  I think that helped me enjoy the movie more, because the way the story unfolded actually set me thinking and anticipating in a manner that i could not have had i known more about the storyline.  The message at the end of the movie is simple, but certainly open for debate.  In fairness, i don't think the director attempted to provide an answer, as to whether the decision made by the Nameless One was the correct one or not, but rather to ask questions. I'd better not give out too much here, but it certainly set me thinking about things for a little while after the show had ended.  These days, any movie that can get me pondering after the credits go down has got to be pretty good.Overall an excellent movie.  I'm sure some areas could be better, but i can't think of any right now.  Highly recommended.Score: 8.5/10"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"A few things about this film struck me. My background coming into it is as an East Asian Studies major - I studied the language, culture, literature, film, history, religion, and politics of China. This was all done in undergrad so I am by no means the last word on the subject.First of all, I noticed heavy use of Daoist symbols. The five elements were used - one per fight - fire, wind, water, wood, and metal. A message in the film seemed to show the Daoist idea that the harder you try, the worse you do, as Moon did in her fights. On the other hand, if you can go with the Dao (think: Use the force, Luke), you will succeed.Second, I did not know before watching the film that it was Zhang Yimou's. His films are often critical of the Chinese Communist Party and sometimes have deep allegorical meaning. Some of his films are banned in China. Hero, on the other hand, seemed to be intensely nationalistic. Lately in China, the communist government has promoted nationalism (instead of populist Communist values as they did pre-1976) with a great degree of success. The use of the word ""Tianxia"" (literally ""all under heaven,"" translated in the movie was ""Our Land"") seems Confucian and nationalistic at the same time. Although I would have not guessed this film was by Zhang Yimou from the plot or message, the cinematography was unmistakable. Hero eerily reminded me of another film, Yellow Earth (Huang Tudi), which Zhang Yimou did not direct but for which he did the cinematography.Third, historically, Hero lacked in a few very obvious places. The Qin Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was legendary for his fear of death and his Machiavellian rule. When his character states that he no longer fears death because of Broken Sword's words and invites Nameless to kill him, he is entirely breaking with the true historical figure of the emperor. Remember, this is the emperor who built an entire terracotta army to protect him from his enemies in death and spent a lot of money and effort looking for the secret to reach immortality. He was known for a Confucian philosophy spin-off known as Legalism, which is very similar to Western Machiavellianism. While his quick mind (or his advisor's) might have figured out Nameless's plot, he would never have hesitated in executing him.Overall, this seems like a break from the usual genre one would expect from Zhang Yimou. I am not sure exactly what message he is trying to convey with this film, other than an endorsement of Chinese nationalism and perhaps Daoism as well."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Now I'm not as into foreign films as I should be, and this one really makes me ashamed of not paying more attention to them. The story-telling in this movie is so vivid and poetic that you cannot help but love every single second of every single story that is told. The Character Sky represents strategy and cunning, Broken Sword represents rationale and understanding whereas Flying Snow is hatred and revenge. Nameless (Jet Li) encounters all of these characters and embodies all of their aspects.The color schemes used are incandescent and only help to propel the viewers into the tales that these warriors are telling the audience and each other. With one story you get white, another red, green, blue. They set the mood and get you the viewer anxious to know what this story will say. The way that each story is presented (although some untrue) builds the characters up in a way that you see that there is more to them than their basic diagnostic. You really see this exampled with Flying Snow, as she is shown as wanton, loving, vengeful and true. In the end you really need all of the stories to understand every character fully.The director of this movie did an outstanding job. This movie has great editing and direction, it is very clean and precise, never losing the attention of the audience.If you don't like foreign movies this movie will change your mind to appreciate them, and if you already like them then this will jump to the top of your list of favorites. Brilliantly done 9/10"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"When I first saw ""Hero"" during it's original American theatrical release, I was mesmerized by the brilliant use of color and exceptional cinematography. I've thought about that visually stunning display for a long time, even after forgetting what the actual story was about. I decided to watch it again for the experience, this time finding my interest intrigued by the complexity of the tale. Perhaps intended for the viewer to arrive at his own conclusions, the sequences as recounted by Nameless (Jet Li) and refuted by the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) are nothing less than spectacular, a work of magic by director Yimou Zhang.In the special features section of the DVD, Zhang relates how he tried for years to find a successful treatment on the history of his subject. Failing, he decided to do the screenplay himself to capture the vision he had of the unification of the warring states. Reading other knowledgeable reviewers' recaps of that history has been enlightening for me, and helps to understand the dichotomy in the motives of the films' principals.Much like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I like to think of this movie not as a martial arts film, but a film with martial arts in it. Both successfully put behind them the era of action Kung Fu flicks that often seem more caricature than believable, more over the top than entertaining. Political and humanistic considerations aside, ""Hero"" makes for landmark storytelling, handled with deep conviction and reverence by it's creator."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"It's not often that a film's visual virtuosity has the ability to hit you right between the eyes. I'm still saying 'WOW', and this may go on for days. Every shot is a masterpiece of composition combined with fluid, stylized movements as graceful and technically precise as the strokes of a master calligrapher's brush. And the storyline is faithful to the best of the classical taoist fables. Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu breathe in every frame of this film. I was grateful as well to the film's releasers for not dubbing it into English, which would have destroyed the unity of this grand opus. A gorgeous film, absolutely stunning. If ever I teach AP English classes again, I will most certainly be using this film in my classes as perhaps the penultimate example of how filmmakers use color, composition, music, and movement to reinforce complex metaphorical and philosophical themes. Thank you, whomever talked US movie distributors into putting this into theaters."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"There's no doubt 'Hero (2002)' is lavish, with opulent production design decorating sometimes upwards of eighteen-thousand period-dressed extras and elaborate fight choreography coming up in almost each and every scene (whether or not it's honestly needed). However, all of its splendour tells a tale that essentially amounts to very little other than thinly veiled pseudo-propaganda (though an argument can be made for full-blown propaganda) that paints one of China's past ruthless dictators as a misunderstood 'hero'. No amount of overindulgent excess can fix that or do anything towards making you care about the admittedly impressive visuals you're seeing. All it does is drive the budget through the roof. This was - at its release, at least - China's most expensive motion picture and, while it certainly shows in the scale of the scenery, it isn't reflected by the scope of the story. It's not like the movie is particularly bad. The action-sequences are usually quite breath-taking, using their literal 'story' nature to 'make sense of' - or otherwise solidify - and accentuate their slightly fantastical nature. They often fall into a place of total inconsequence, though, with some being entirely invented even within the possibly invented narrative in which they appear. They also usually lack the weight to make them feel tangible, impactful or properly consequential. This is something not helped by the fact that we know how most of them turn out, due to the poorly acted framing device. This actually acts as more of a limitation than a unique way to tell the tale. It does allow for various perspectives to be placed upon similar events, which are portrayed with varying colour schemes to initially unnoticed but ultimately appreciated effect, but doesn't allow for enough divergence within the narrative and neuters the possibility of anything having any real consequence until the movie catches up with itself. Once it does, its message becomes even more confused and more likely to inspire an eyebrow being raised than the swell of pride that's intended. By this time, the poor pace of the piece has become grating, to the point that the previously somewhat awe-inspiring fight-work has become kind of a chore to sit through, which, perhaps strangely, makes the ending feel less definitive than it actually is. This is really because there isn't a sense of structure, no proper finale outside of an uncharacteristic choice that only serves to pander to the movie's agenda, as opposed to the natural direction of the character's intentions. There are some slightly resonant themes stuck in there, though, even if you have to read past some pretty operatically iffy outside elements to get to them. In the end, the film is much more impressive from a visual standpoint than a narrative one. Even this doesn't hold up, though, because you don't really care about the characters and, as such, can't stay fully engaged throughout. 5/10"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Confused, mainly because when I saw Ying Xiong on DVD-Video recently, I did not see the masterpiece promised by many others. What I saw was very entertaining, granted, but perhaps the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino's name as a ""presenter"" on the cover art put me off. This man needs to get his head out and realise he is not the messiah of cinema that he so often tries to project. Having said that, however, those who are fully involved with the film give it their all, and the results are frequently awesome. Forget all the stereotypes you know about poorly-synced Kung Fu flicks. This is a film with a serious story to tell, and that the story allows for many a fleeting display of martial arts skill is mere coincidence. All the elements for a brilliant epic are here, but something feels like it is missing. If I had to take a rough guess, Ying Xiong tries to be China's (or Japan's) answer to Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but doesn't quite get there for a number of reasons.Perhaps it is because of the comparatively short screen time. I am always the first to complain if a film goes on for longer than it should, but the ninety-nine minutes I saw here did not seem adequate to the storytelling task. The story, for what it is worth, revolves around an assassin who is known as Nameless. In the years before China was a unified country, he faces down three assassins who plot the murder of the feudal Lord who would unite the provinces into one nation. The film is told in a flashback style, detailing how Nameless fights down each of the assassins, and to be honest, this is where part of the problem begins. Until I read the IMDb summary, I had no idea that the film was about a warrior preventing the assassination of a King. With the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flashbacks within flashbacks, and everything in between, I was lost and confused. I have enjoyed other films where flashbacks occur within flashbacks, Ghosts Of Mars being a good example, but this risky cinematic technique was done well, as well as sparingly, in those films.In spite of the confusing edit and screenplay, Jet Li proves that he is currently the most famous lead in straight-faced Kung Fu films for a reason. His acting, especially the physical mannerisms, help to sell the character where the dialogue often will not. Some of his most striking scenes involve his complete silence. Unfortunately, the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style of choreography is used here, with actors moving about on wires and going through impossible motions that really do not suit the story. Yes, the style worked well in CTHD, but I really felt, given the tone and serious context of the story, that a more down-to-Earth style would have helped. It is not a good sign when an even more outlandish Jet Li film, The One, features a more believable style of fighting than this one. Especially given that The One was basically a load of the proverbial, albeit one with a very sound background explanation. The fact that it had Carla Gugino, a far more likable lead actress than I have seen to date in any Asian film, didn't hurt.I admit, once the confusion over the nature of the plot is settled, it does make the film somewhat more entertaining. Unfortunately, it also raises a lot of questions that the film fails to satisfactorily answer. The question of why one would want to protect this King, who is seemingly responsible for the annihilation of a village as depicted in the early stage of the film, is high among them. Also taking a high place among the unanswered questions is why there is all the need for this study of calligraphy to defeat one of the three assassins. Yes, I realise that it is meant to improve fighting techniques, but the amount of time devoted to calligraphy in the film makes this easy to forget. I also found the derivation of swordsmanship secrets from calligraphy a bit hard to swallow. Maybe someone can figure something out about me from the way I always write in heavy block, but I doubt it will hold true once they take the time to make further observations. Still, the rolling out of the armies in each scene of this kind were impressive enough to justify the viewing time. Even if the repeated calls for Nameless' head towards the end of the film got on the nerves a bit. I am somewhat curious as to how the arrows were shot, too. If they are CGI, then they are the most impressive CGI I have seen for a while.In all, I gave Ying Xiong, or Hero as it is known here, a seven out of ten. It is not the best Kung Fu feature you will ever see, nor is it an indispensable classic of human drama. What it does have going for it is a very solid lead actor who should appear in more films, and some absolutely stunning cinematography. Fans of martial arts-based cinema need look no further, while those of us who prefer solid story or characters will also do well with a singular viewing."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"It's not often I say ""classic"" for this genre, there are certain milestones. Much like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon back in 2000, Hero became popular in western audiences due to its easy accessibility and minimal dialogue. This film is absolutely gorgeous. One of THE most beautiful, stunning, majestic cinematic pieces ever conceived. The use of colour is so extraordinary that me attempting to describe it won't do it justice. Whole scenes are built on colours. Costumes, production design, the environment...all based on one colour. An example would be the fight scene in the woods where all the leaves and trees are autumnal, the costumes are shades of red. Then later on in the scene, the shades of yellow and brown transition to red seamlessly and it is just so damn beautiful. If a scene takes place in a desert then everything is presented as yellow. How about in the King's palace? The interior design, armour and costumes are black. It's not even subtle, so you will notice it but it's entrancing and makes the experience ever so hypnotising. The film is about a Nameless warrior retelling his eradication of three assassins to the King, but not everything is as clear as what he says it is. It's an intriguing narrative, if I were to dive into it it would spoil the plot. But there is a point where we have a flashback within a flashback (flashbackception?) so that should give you a clue regarding the linearity of the plot. Important themes are explored such as the similarities between idealism and love, how one can kill or be willing to die for an ideal or love. Excellently acted by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, two assassins who are embroiled in a complicated love affair. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are there to provide the amazing action. A martial arts classic is not without its action, and Hero is damn full of it. The choreography is rapidly insane...how can anyone comprehend the speed at which these guys fight is beyond me. Just...watch this. Please, it's so good."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"I've liked most of Yimou Zhang's movies. 'Ying Xiong' (a.k.a. 'Hero') may not be one of his finest films but it's the execution that is fascinating. The visuals are breathtaking and the camera-work is energetic. Yimou's use of symbolism through elements like water, earth and wind and his use of colours (namely red, blue, white and green) is very amusing. The fight scenes are well choreographed but the slow motion and gliding in thin air is overdone (though not as irritatingly as was in 'Wo Hu Cang Long'). The background score flows beautifully with the ongoing sequences.However, the main problem is the story. The first hour or so focuses on 3 different versions of one event most of which weren't true. The last 20 minutes shows us what really happened/happens and the conclusion is pointless. Well, the entire story has no point. Had Yimou picked a compelling story to tell, then 'Ying Xiong' may have been a masterpiece.Jet Li fails to impress. He fails to show any emotion at all. Ziyi Zhang's expressions look forced. She lacks spontaneity. Daoming Chen is strictly alright. Donnie Yen does well in a small role. However, the best performances come from Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung. They beautifully display the love between Broken Sword and Flying Snow and make it easier for the viewer to sympathize for them in spite of their flawed characters.So, 'Ying Xiong' has almost everything going for it. It only needed a good story and better performances from some of the cast."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was good, this is amazing!! Watch the fight scene in the golden forest for example. I don't think that violence has ever looked so beautiful as it does in this movie! Oh and the characters and plot are nothing to sneeze at either. Story is told in a way that is reminiscent of ""Rashomon"" but with a few twists of it's own!"
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"Every year as August winds down, ending with it the summer movie season, I get burned out on theatrical releases, having seen most all of the major summer flicks, as well as many independent films. Typically one release resurrects my cinematic spirit, and this year ""Hero"" (""Ying xiong"") filled the role. It is the latest martial arts film from China to invade American cineplexes. In many ways, it reminds of the last such successful film, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" except that ""Hero"" has a plot. Just kidding...sort of. In actuality, the story is much more concise and straightforward than ""Crouching,"" despite the non-linear method. In ancient China, the nameless...er...hero of the story, portrayed by the familiar Jet Li, arrives at the palace of the emperor. Having slain three of the emperor's enemies, Li, whose character is nameless, has come to claim his reward. As the two discuss how Nameless accomplished his deeds, we see (through extensive flashbacks) what did and didn't happen, and the truth is ultimately unearthed. Were the plot told in a linear manner, the story would not be especially noteworthy, but how the tale is told elevates the narrative. With truths being revealed in an unorthodox order, the audience is kept off-guard and pensive, trying to match wits with the two primary characters, who are each uniquely brilliant. Like most Chinese cinema, much about ""Hero"" is drastically different from the majority American cinema. Most blatantly apparent is the vivid color scheme. Exploding off the screen, the variety of dominant colors throughout the flashbacks propels the film by generating a bold yet natural vivacity that leaves viewers eager to indulge in whatever beauty may occur next. The cinematography of some films (""Lord of the Rings"") rightfully soars due in large part to the scenery. But ""Hero"" excels using traditional photography in a non-traditional manner with a dramatically ebullient color palette that literally takes one's breath away at times. Despite the nearly peerless visual artistry, ""Hero"" still presents an occasionally difficult viewing experience, one that does not necessarily detract but does sometimes distract. I say this fully aware that as I have been raised, for better and worse, on American cinema, and am thusly accustomed to such work. Chinese films are quite simply different, and these vagaries of pacing, shot length, etc., prevent full involvement for many American movie-goers. There isn't one feature of ""Hero"" that causes this disconnect, as all aspects are well executed. The small cast, with Jet Li as the primary recognizable face, effectively exhibits the renowned passion of Chinese cinema. The editing is clean and efficient, maintaining a clear narrative when the story could easily have been convoluted. None of the parts produce the difference. It's more like watching a genre you've never seen before; you're simply not entirely sure how to react at times.Bottom Line: If you're a fan of Chinese martial arts films, then you may have already obtained a DVD of ""Hero,"" since it was released in China two years ago. If not, or if you want a different cinematic experience, then go see ""Hero"" to discover the upper tier of Chinese cinema. You won't regret it. A high 7 or low 8, out of 10."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"How to describe ""Hero""? Well, it doesn't suffice to call it an action movie; it's a lot more psychological than that. It tells of how a warrior known only as Nameless (Jet Li) defeated some assassins who sought to kill the emperor. Like many Chinese or Hong Kong movies today, it employs some scenes that previously would have only been suited to fantasy movies. But they do an impressive job with such imagery here. Maybe ""Hero"" could qualify as a fantasy, but it uses so many different methods of story-telling, that you almost can't narrow the movie down to one classification. Zhang Yimou, who continued his fascinating streak with ""The House of Flying Daggers"", made a masterpiece here. You have to see it."
英雄,Hero (2002),,2002,2004.08.27,"I saw Hero in the cinema on its release here in the UK way back in 2004. I was blown away then, and still to this day it mesmerises me how seamless and astonishingly well crafted it is, with so much subtlety that you notice more of with repeated viewings, especially the fight scene between the Emperor and Broken Sword, which may be the most poignant / best 2-3 minutes of audiovisual material ever put to film. I say that from watching it dozens of times over and over just now, and its subtleties are endless.It's my favourite Chinese movie, and in my Top 10 movies ever, alongside Lonesome Dove, LOTR Extended, Kingdom of Heaven Directors Cut, Kimi no Na Wa, and others.I really love Yimou Zhang's movies, and for me, Hero is definitely his best."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"While fifth generation Chinese directors Zhang Yimou succumbed to crowd pleasing, turning out cheap, hollow, showy crap like Flying Dagger, sixth generation Jia Zhangke continues to remain faithful to making movies that reflect the sometimes painful metamorphosis the Chinese populace is going through at the crossroad of modernization. The World is such a recent attempt, although there are comments that this movie has already treaded across the line of commercialism.""The World"" here is a miniature world theme park which might be a novelty to Beijing but not the modernized parts of the world (there was one en route from Toronto to Niagara Falls over three decades ago, albeit at a smaller scale). The story evolves around dancer Xiao Tao (ZHAO Tao) and her boyfriend Tiasheng (CHEN Tiasheng). (While the actor conveniently adopted his real name for the character, Tao in the movie means ""peach"" while Tao in the actress means ""waves"", two entirely different words). Through the daily lives in the park (part of which is still under construction) and visits from various friends and relatives of the two main characters, we are exposed to how people interact, think, perceive, love, and more. Many of the sequences and dialogue are so realistic and real that you would wonder if these are simply people in the street asked by director Jia to stand in front of the camera (but some distance away) and converse the way they normally do.The storytelling is straightforward and efficient, sometimes to the point of being skeletal. The camera is objective, impassionate and some may even call it dull. As if to make up for it, director Jia interspersed the script with animations, sometimes to mark off short episodes, each separately titled.Not for the general audience, The World has an air of the rough-diamond kind of crudeness that makes it quite appealing to seekers of less main-stream cinemas. I do find it a little too long, even when I watched a two-hour version rather than the 140 minute version billed in the IMDb listing."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"""The World (Shijie)"" is one of the saddest films I've ever seen and is a moving visualization of the tragedy of rising expectations.While it is set very particularly in China, it achingly proves the universality of the twin globalization pulls of modernization and immigration over the past three hundred years around the world, recalling films from ""Hester Street"" to ""The Emigrants (Utvandrarna),"" and films about cities in throes of developmental change, like ""Atlantic City."" These are universally recognizable young people - they rebel against and yet feel tied to their families and regretfully break ties with old friends; they fight with their siblings but bail them out; they get lonely, a bit homesick, and bored; they are jealous and ambitious; and they constantly compromise, particularly the women bargaining with the oldest currency. With what is a bit heavy-handed symbolism, the film is specifically set in what I presume is a real amusement park called ""The World"" on the outskirts of Beijing that replicates landmarks in scaled miniature and focuses on the employees and their extended, inter-connected network of friends and family.At first, they look to us as swaggering city sophisticates, as they dress-up in international costumes for a park revue, surrounded by emblems of international commercial culture, like fake Louis Vuitton bags and movie posters, such as of ""Titanic,"" They jealously and zealously call each other constantly by the most modern cell phone and text messengers, particularly from the encircling monorail that at first seems like a symbol of modern technology, but is really cobbled together from airplane parts--though one woman wistfully notes that she doesn't know anyone who has been on a plane- a frequent response to a call is ""I'm on the train."" -- but by the end the canned voice of progress is emblematic of the dead end circularity of their lives as they can't get passports to leave, let alone to see the real landmarks.Travel is a constant theme visually and of conversation - when a country bumpkin shows up, the surprised greeting is ""How did you get here?"" such that ""I bought a ticket."" is not self-evident. -- to the security guards riding camels around the fake pyramids and horses around the fake castles, to the six hour bus ride it takes to another city to pay off a relative's gambling debts, and emphasized through fanciful animated interstices. The ironic geographical headings of the chapters emphasize a character's quixotic goal -- ""world.com"", ""Ulan Bator Evening,"" ""Belleville"", ""Tokyo Story."" Striving as they all are, for these folks even Ulan Bator, the depressed capital of Mongolia, looks like a step up.There are moving scenes when immigrants with different languages try to communicate to share the commonalities in their lives -- a Russian immigrant is terrified when her passport is taken away, while the Chinese woman is envious that she even has one.It is a bit confusing keeping up with the various characters, in and out of their work costumes, especially when the two main characters seemed to change so much without explanation, but they are enormously sympathetic so it is devastating as we see their hopes and dreams, however unrealistic or selfish, defeated. And those who succeed do so on very compromised terms.They are also not very articulate, which writer/director Zhang Ke Jia compensates for by spending a lot of time slowly setting up individual scenes and watching people interact, as we see how different they are in different contexts with different people, as body language becomes more important than words, whether spoken or in text messages.While the cinematography was beautiful, the print I saw in New York was a bit scratchy and the English subtitles had several misspellings. I'm sure subtitle-dependent viewers lose a lot of the significance of different accents and regional differences among the employees from all over China."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Jia Zhangke's The World, his first state supported film, continues his look at the disillusionment of Chinese youth with Western-style globalization but shifts the setting from a rural to an urban environment. Young people work at Beijing's 114-acre ""World Park"", a sprawling Chinese Disneyland that displays scale models of famous landmarks such as The Eiffel Tower, The Pyramids of Egypt, The Leaning Tower of Pisa, The Taj Mahal, and The Vatican. For most of the low-paid employees, however, it is the closest they will ever come to seeing the world. Jointly produced by the Shanghai Film Group Corporation and Hong Kong's Xinghui Production Company, The World, unlike his previous independent work (Unknown Pleasures, Platform), has a big budget, glossy special effects, animation sequences, colorfully costumed song and dance routines, and uncharacteristic melodramatic plot contrivances.The film's main protagonists are young Chinese who have come to the city from rural areas to find work at the theme park and come in contact with migrants, petty criminals, and other lowlife characters who seem to thrive in this consumer-centered environment. The plot consists of the turbulent love affair between a dancer named Tao (Zhao Tao) who performs in lavish shows at the park and a security guard named Taisheng (Chen Taisheng) who has trouble remaining faithful to her. Zhao Tao, who has appeared in other Jia films, is sparkling in her role as the dancer whose horizons become more and more constricted. When she tells him, 'You're my whole life.' he replies, 'You can't count on anyone these days. Don't think so much of me.' As critic David Walsh points out, ""all the young people have great trouble expressing their emotions to one another; they prefer cell-phones and text messages. The picture of a terribly repressed and repressive society, with vast problems and contradictions, begins to emerge"". The employees live in overcrowded dorms or sleazy hotels and a group of Russian performers have their passports taken away when they arrive and some are forced to become prostitutes. In a heartbreaking sequence, Tao's brother Erxiao is arrested by the police for petty theft, and his brother, a construction worker known as ""little sister"", experiences a distressing industrial accident. Jia presents the world in small episodes, similar he says to the ""way you use a computer-you click here, you click there, each time leading you to another location."" The vignettes, however, did not come together for me as a totally satisfying experience and the animation effects seemed showy. The World has stunning visuals and relevant social commentary and I'm happy to see Jia achieve a wider audience by working through the system, but by the end of The World, I felt that the sharp edge of his previous films had been lost."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"How can you truly show disconnection. I think I have truly seen a master in action with Shijie, a film that takes place in a world theme park (this place does really exist) in China.Zhang Ke Jia is a masterful director. His use of colour and character direction is unreal. One of the things he uses to great effect are arches and hallways. Characters appear in them, or look out of them in what is some of the most visual photography I have ever witnessed. There is also a great conversation scene between two characters who don't share the same language, and the use of reflected light that is truly remarkable, make sure to watch for this scene. But it doesn't end there.Zhang also does something so miraculous that I thought would be impossible. He borrows heavily from Ozu, particularly a scene that is reminiscent of Tokyo Story and makes something that is uniquely his own.The basic synopsis of ""The World"", is of the lives of the workers in the theme park. Some romances develop, a foreign Russian worker Anna is introduced to the group even though she and another Chinese girl Tao don't share the same language. Everyday trials and tribulations happen for these young adults who are trying to work in the 'New China'.Somehow though with all the issues involved, rural people coming into the cities, technological communication, the erosion of China's agrarian past, the fakeness of place, the exploitation of workers and lead up to prostitution, the camaraderie of friends, the cheapness of life.. somehow all of these themes are jumbled into a glorious presentation that you can't take your eyes off of.The film is beyond surreal, its real setting makes it all more spectacular and that more effective. I had a hard time separating the actors from the characters, at times I thought I was watching a documentary and I prayed or hoped for someone to do well and be happy and find themselves thinking that these were real people in harsh sometimes difficult situations. ""The World"" has this effect on you, you can't begin to believe the beauty and harshness it shows, and it tricks you in the most crafty way.The World is a truly fantastic small place in more ways than one...Rating 9 out of 10"
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"""The World"" is set in the tacky eponymous Beijing theme park and details the lives of the alienated young workers who are spiritually and physically trapped there. It's a subtle, delicate, yet powerful film with a directing style that can best described as artfully unobtrusive. The young director/writer is a master of composition, camera movement and sound. Some of the scenes unspool without editing for several minutes, the camera mostly still, sometimes moving with the action but never on the whim of the filmmaker. Sound and dialogue occur off-screen in a way that reminds one of the great Japanese director Ozu. (Indeed, one of the film's inter-titled chapters is called ""Tokyo Story"". One of the best examples of this style is a grimy hotel room scene between the lead couple in which very little happens--an attempted seduction, but no sex--that is so authentic it feels almost voyeuristic to watch. In another scene, a father counts and pockets four stacks of money bestowed to him by the authorities for the accidental death of his son, his face an expressionless mask that hides more pain than could ever be shown. In an opening scene the camera tracks a female dancer running through a theatre backstage, pleading for a band aid she will never get--thus slyly presaging the untreatable tragedies that will eventually unfold. The central characters are so alone, alienated and unable to communicate in any meaningful way--much of the dialogue is spoken into the ubiquitous cellphones--that the closest any two people come together are two woman--one Chinese, the other Russian--who don't speak a word of each other's language. This is the best kind of social commentary a film can offer, images that show and don't tell. At times it feels plodding--especially the last half hour--some of the characters could use more development, and the animated cellphone sequences seem unnecessary and distracting. But the depiction of contemporary urban China's deepening social malaise--the result of far too rapid urbanization and unchecked Westernization--is troubling enough to make one fear the country's--and the world's--future."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"A friend of mine says that his defining image of modern China is of a marble facade slapped onto a jerry-built wall; and it's this kind of picture that also emerges from 'The World', a touching movie about the lives of a group of workers in a Beijing theme park in which all the planet's tourist attractions are copied in a single location. Beautifully acted, the film provides an interesting insight into the patterns of behaviour of young Chinese; but the underlying tone is melancholic, and this flavour grows stronger as the story progresses; in some ways, it's a tale about the death of hope. But it's done with a light touch, some striking photography and some nicely realised animated interludes. I found it moving and subtle, and ultimately, very sad."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"While this film is radically different from Jia's earlier films it still packs the same cultural criticism wallop. A commentary on the urbanization of modern day China, Jia has moved into the slick world of government approved film-making without losing touch with the direction of his earlier films. It is tempting to watch the film superficially and dismiss it as a glossy state approved image. However, from my perspective, what is happening in the film is much more subtle; it is form of art-making that is particular to China and its authoritarian governing systems through history.Practically speaking China has never enjoyed freedom of expression for its artists and writers. In order to get around censorship that came from absolute monarchies or dictatorships artists and writers would use subtle inter-textual messages. For instance, a line or radical would be left out a character to slightly change the meaning within the text. The head radical might be left out of a character describing the emperor to indicate the writers desire that the emperor be beheaded, or something along those lines. They were small enough messages that sympathizers would pick up on them, but a censor (censors usually not being the brightest or most creative people around) would miss it.It is my opinion that Jia Zhangke is doing something along these lines with this film. It may not be as subtle as the messages have historically been, but a close reading clearly conveys something the government wouldn't be happy with. The Chinese government would like for the world to see them as metropolitan, glitzy, shiny, and new, so Jia, in this first film of his with government backing, uses cinema-scope, modern techno beats, computer animation and up-to-date electronics. But under the glitz is the reality screaming to get through the World Park facade. It is dirty and personal. There is prostitution, crime, and pirate copiers (maybe the theme here is modern Chinese society, as promoted by the government and big business, that is the pirated copy of the rest of the world). The subsistence living youth can all have cell phones, but for all their text messaging they don't seem to be able to communicate. Basically Jia seems to say that the Chinese youth are headed for a future of oblivion under the current direction of their country. It is hard to disagree with him. But at least he he leaves a morsel of hope in the end of it all."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"""See the world without leaving Beijing.""Maybe in America a theme park based on recreating various monuments from around the world would be seen as representing a mix of consumerism and cultural arrogance. In the real-life Beijing World Park that we see in this film, it seems to signal modernization, but at the same time, isolation from the world, and a certain falseness. That falseness can be seen in several other things - faking politeness in awkward social situations, the cheesy tourist photos in front of the model of the Leaning Tower, and believing in commitment and love with another person (the relationships in the film are all strained). Even the choreographed, glitzy dance routines might be seen in a different light. The characters are for the most part earnest and humble, but quietly give off a feeling of longing and desire for something more (maybe the desire to have the ability to break free and see the real world?), and I loved how director Jia Zhangke added the graphic art in fantasy sequences to help emphasize that. The visuals throughout the film are strong as well, but what I was impressed by most was the acting. So many of these scenes truly feel real. The one where the elders accept an insurance payout for their son's death is simply extraordinary, and immensely touching. Overall though, the film was a little slow and sedate for my taste (especially for its length), so it was a near miss for me, but fans of realism will probably like it more."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Though this movie is to some extent, demanding on the audience, a little patience and decent memory will leave you spellbound after the movie. I do warn that if you don't have the patience for books such as The Idiot, don't watch it. Otherwise, I'm sure it will be enjoyable. Jiangke takes the candor of Yasujiro Ozu's dramas and removes kindness, whimsicality, and love and replaces these with loneliness, harshness, and austerity. Powerful combination. The lead actress acts in a way that seems to forget that it's being filmed for a movie. The level of focus on her part is astounding to me. This is in fact true for the entire cast. The irony of the movie lies in its title: The World - a word that conveys a sense of endless possibility. What you get is quite the opposite - in fact the characters seem to be confined by such a level of endless impossibility that the throughout the film, I found myself fearing an imminent gunfight. That never came but the end is equally, if not, more shocking."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"At the World Park in Beijing, visitors can wander around the globe, taking pictures of scale models of the Eiffel Tower, or the Manhattan Skyline with the World Trade Center intact. The people who work amid its gleaming and well-maintained structures see the underside. It's not just the worn and graffiti-laded back rooms, but the unnoticed weirdness, where one day an actress might be a model on a Milan runway, the next a Japanese tea hostess and the third an African native by a Great Pyramid little taller than she. Who are they when not performing? Are their ambitions work-related or life-related? Is their lack of clear identity a matter of youth, environment or character?Zhangke Jia wrote this movie, and directed it around the actual park. It's a long movie, 140 minutes in length, and at the end the characters are just as vague and confused as at the beginning. they're still cheering beautiful women, world peace and no freckles, in some combination of being lost, trapped and exactly where they want to be."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"If you want to get an aesthetic view on modern China, this is an excellent vehicle. Over two hours long, some scenes are poetic and subtle with an Eastern beauty lovely to behold. English sub-titles are well done.A big screen experience of common workers from the countryside and the artistic dance community in the big city of Beijing.There is a lot of smoking... and cell phone use, of course - this is the new China. Some animation sequences provide creative transitions of scenes.Not for the adrenaline junkie addicted to violence.Excellent portrayal of relationships. A true artist behind the camera. The acting is so natural.The backdrop and chapters are structured around the different national landmarks at the World Theme Park in Beijing. ( 8/10 )"
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Few directors in any genre anywhere in the world have been able to capture the heart and true essence of a modern nation in just two short hours as Zhang has done with Shijie. After books like Ted Fishman's ""China Inc."" or Gordon Chang's ""The Coming Collapse of China"", this film arrives as a breath of fresh air sharing at a very personal level just how a rapidly changing China isn't always dealing with her 'prosperity' and globalization as easily as we would hope. The World is perhaps one of the best modern Asian films in years. We can only hope Zhang Ke Jia will continue to write, direct and interpret his homeland for us for years to come. Shijie is an emotional tour de force on modern China."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Zhang Ke Jia is a talented director, there's no doubt. He creates moods and images of beauty and loneliness, ones that feel lived in. Unfortunately, he's not the best screenwriter in the world. There are a lot of themes and points of interest in The World, which is about a Beijing theme park that contains all the world's greatest monuments and the employees who work there. These employees mostly have never been out of China. Some of them have migrated to Beijing from the country, and some have maybe never left Beijing. But much like his previous two films, Platform and Unknown Pleasures, there isn't a single character worth knowing here. I don't understand the (mostly Asian) art-house trend of populating films with characters who are shallow and bored with life. Characters who are bored with life are just, well, boring. Much like Platform, the dozens of characters here are so interchangeable that their mostly trite stories became mixed up in my mind. Someday I think Zhang Ke Jia will make a really good film. The potential is there."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"The Chinese film ""The World"" is set in an amusement park that offers its patrons the opportunity to ""experience the whole world without ever leaving Beijing."" This it accomplishes through monorail tours of miniaturized replicas of the Eiffel Tower, The Taj Mahal, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Vatican, even the Manhattan skyline complete with a pair of still-intact Twin Towers. The movie focuses primarily on a young woman named Tao, who works as one of the performers who roams from ""country"" to ""country"" throughout the park performing native dances (her specialty appears to be Indian), and her rocky relationship with a security guard named Taisheng.The main problem with ""The World"" is that the setting is so intriguing and visually arresting that it winds up completely dominating the drama, which is as diffuse, meandering and plodding as the direction by Zhang Ke Jia, who shoots his scenes almost exclusively in impersonal medium shots. There's a certain sad irony in the fact that the movie's characters are stuck working in a bizarre facsimile of the world when all they really yearn for is to travel to exciting and far-off places - and start new lives - beyond their own land (the park even features, as one of its attractions, an old defunct jetliner that people can sit in and pretend they're actually going somewhere). Unfortunately, with the movie clocking in at a seemingly interminable 138-minute running time, it is WE THE VIEWERS who ultimately feel trapped by the experience.There are a number of lyrical moments and haunting images in the film, and Ke Jia does capture with full force the astonishing strides China has made in joining the technological revolution (all the characters have the most up-to-date cell phones, for instance). But all the peripheral virtues of setting and theme can't compensate for the overweening dullness and listlessness of the drama at the core."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"I'm wholly new to cinema from mainland China; I hear some interesting things are afoot, and perhaps as with so many other things right now, we'll have to start keeping an eye over there for tomorrow being shaped?Anyway, if we listen to the tagline, this is about the effect of Western urbanization on Chinese youth, which is the same as everywhere else has been, readjusting traditions of centuries. Dialects are eclipsed, family is left behind in some remote village, life in the big city can be harsh and alienates, but this only affirms things we've had a headstart on the Chinese for a few decades now.The main setting gives this a strange resonance, this is a theme park in Beijing comprising scaled-down replicas of some of the world's most renowned monuments spread over a hundred acres, the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal. The metaphor about the whole world being artificially erected is a bit dreary - the place is called the 'World Park' - but makes for some awesome imagery along the way.Everyone of the small group we follow is a transient in his way, uncertainly caught for a while inbetween stations of life. Roads are a recurring motif, people always going somewhere. So episodic ordinary life in the shadow of artificial monuments, raw breathing punctuated with song and dance performed on a stage, weariness, boredom, colorful flights of fancy, rivalry, unexpected friendship, death, brazen declarations of love.But only being introduced to the filmmaker for the first time, I have to wonder; is he a kind of Jarmusch, simply romancing the melancholy drifting of souls beneath the streetlights? Can he be an Iwai or Wong Kar Wai? Subtle, transcendent pulls between worlds of pure weightlessness?It's too early for me to tell. One thing's for sure, he's got to be one of the most talented with a camera right now. He needs to add brevity, structure to his landscape painting."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"It's not a hit movie, it will be a cult classic over time, like many of his other works. Poor folks want to watch ""Who wants to become a millionaire"" while the limo-democrats want to patronize the 'disadvantaged' by throwing other people's money at the government bureaucrats. But once in a while there comes along a true genius who comes from down below but with a true gift to show to the world what really is like down there in the real world. Jia is one such genius. He's the only Chinese writer director I truly feel proud of. Only thing about the movie that is kinda disappointing is that I thought the ending of this movie actually betrayed the writer/director's unique style of low key and moderation/ showing something through nothing. To me the ending is really not necessary - I thought the real suffering is in the living not the dead. Maybe Jia ZK wanted to show us he can jerk tears as well if he likes to? Anyway, I was a bit disappointed by this ending really - or the death of the construction worker. Maybe Jia is the new China's Dickens. His movie language is disturbing and profound. What we see through his lens in China is not pretty, but real, excruciatingly real. China is often shown as the high rises in the city, or the shanty towns on the fringe, Jia is the gifted few who show everything else in between as what they really are - and that is the real China most people don't care to see or don't want to see. When you are stuck in between, you don't always get good choices..."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"When you drive through the suburbs of Beijing, or through most of eastern China for that matter, you are struck by its bleakness: grey and brown, flat, ugly, industrialised, big square building blocks covered in bathroom tiles, and fog or smog practically the whole year round. In this perfect illustration of the post-modern wasteland, young people are shown to have no hopes, no illusions. Love is unattainable, communication is impossible. Superficial talk over cell phones is the most intimate they can get. When meeting face to face, they have nothing to say.The World theme park is a metaphor for the lack of cultural identity that's rampant in China these days. Against the background of this ersatz world, a number of protagonists are followed through a variety of sub-plots, very much like Altman in some of his best (Nashville, Short cuts) and worst (The wedding, A perfect couple) work. As a visual evocation of modern Chinese urban life it's striking. But the characters evolving against this canvas remain underdeveloped. They meet and say nothing, they do not meet but talk by cell phone, still saying nothing. Silence can be very telling, if used properly. But one should not confuse silence with depth.It is said that traditional values have all but disappeared in China, and all that's come in their place are blatant money-grabbing capitalism where a human life is of little value (look at all those mine disasters) and superficial imitation of an idea of Western ""culture"" copied from TV. But in my personal experience, Chinese people like to talk, they are not afraid to show their feelings. I often find them much more open than many European people I meet.To me, Shijie shows a realistic picture of the way modern urban China comes across visually, but I cannot recognise the Chinese people in it."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Jia has kept his style but lost some of his edge in this state-funded effort with its rather relentless harping on the irony of a globalized China whose underlings can't get out of the country and are stuck in menial jobs in Beijing, cut off from their native dialects and where they came from and reduced to expressing their strongest emotions in text messages and cellphone chats. There are compelling moments, like the two main lovers Taisheng (Taisheng Chen) and Tao (Tao Zhao) lying on Taisheng's hard dormitory bed and even the schmaltzy wordless communing between Tao and her Russian friend Anna (Alla Shcherbakova), but in the aimless round of daily emptiness of working at this trashy hi-tech carnival falsification of ""The World"" outside, which the workers will never see in person, Jia loses the momentum of the turbulent, emotional decade he chronicles in ""Platform"" or the tragic downward spiral of the two boys in ""Unknown Pleasures."" I don't object to the animations, because they're thematically unified by always being connected to travel and cellphones and they create a sense of link with the 20-somethings, the generation after the director's that he's focusing on here; the fact that they're glib and kitsch just fits with everything else quite intentionally. So does the New Age-y techno music score, which is annoying and repetitious, but again, intentionally so. This time there is a bluntly ironic contrast between the pretty brightly colored costumes of the World shows the girls put on, and the shabby run down environments in which they live off-duty. The contrast is a little too pat: surely some of the environments -- and there is one, at the train station -- off duty are as glittering and new as the World stage shows. One can't say that Jia has lost the complexity of environment he achieved in his earlier films; he's just limited its focus. One may miss the jangling ambient noise of Platform and Unknown Pleasures, though, and particularly the informative TV broadcasts of the latter, which always fit in context even though they may speak to us more than to the characters.For me, Unknown Pleasures is by far the emotional peak of Jia's work so far, and hence the film that puts across his themes most powerfully as well. Next comes Platform, which is off-putting and sometimes almost absurdly hard to follow, but which nonetheless obviously has deep personal significance to the director as an authentic portrait of his generation's journey into the Nineties. The World is almost too self-consciously a development of his themes of alienation and globalization and of a generation without hope or aims. The theme park is almost too obvious and too good a metaphor, and it robs his excellent actors of the opportunity to be themselves for more than a few minutes at a time.What does the ending mean? It seems to mean more than anything else that Jia wants to hit us over the head with the idea that his characters have nowhere to go, and it also seemed to me to be somehow a too-late subconscious attempt to steal from the kind of effects we get in Kiselowski's Dekalog. But it only underlines that this is a world seemingly cut off from any moral system.The World meanders too long, given the failure to connect emotionally, but it is nonetheless a powerful, rich, and original work and Jia is unquestionably one of the great ones of his generation working today, and representing as he does literally millions and millions of people in a dynamic enormously changing country, he stands as one of the world (small W)'s most important movie directors. Whether ""success"" in the form of open film-making and state funding will ""destroy"" him or water down his raw originality remains an open question."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Seen at Adelaide Film Festival whose wide screen brought out the puny personal concerns of workers caught up in a giant enterprise of fake construction and make-believe experience. As a reflection on life realities in China today, yes a good dash of cold water. As personal stories, not very engaging except for the charmingly sensitive lead actress. But I wished they would get on with it, just crank up the pace. An over-riding impression of blue-ness remains with the viewer: it is sad without being bitter, but I'd have liked more bite, more red. Director has a big and important thing going: he plays with the falsity of the world in a cinema tradition going back to Melies, and that's real film-making."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Okay, but not great at all. It was a pretty big disappointment, actually, considering that I really liked Jia Zhang Ke's previous film ""Unknown Pleasures"". This film almost completely abandoned the stark minimalism of that film, instead attempting a Robert Altman-like ensemble piece on a grand scale, complete with sweeping long-take tracking shots. Unfortunately, none of the many story lines prove to be all that compelling. Nearly all of them revolve around young couples and suffer tremendously from stiff, unnatural dialogue and conventional melodrama, both of which are (unfortunate) new traits in Jia Zhang Ke's work. The sheer abundance of dialogue is immediately noticeable, as his previous film was nearly silent. It would be tempting to blame the newfound melodrama on the fact that this is Zhang Ke's first film to be produced with Chinese funding and the the amount of restriction which that entails, but I'm not sure that that's actually the case. I get the feeling that the talkiness and melodrama come rather from the fact that this is Zhang Ke's first film to be set in a major urban center, as opposed the remote, rural towns of his previous films. It's as if he assumes that city life is fast and melodramatic. The constant presence of cell phones in the film plays into this as well, although I don't think this notion is entirely off-base. Also part of this, I suppose, are the film's ill-advised animated sequences, which are amateurish and completely unnecessary, as well as the equally wrong-headed thumping pseudo-techno score, which further encroaches on the possibility for poetic minimalism (which, it should be said, is not completely absent in the film, but rather sidetracked almost as an afterthought).The film itself is about a theme park which features replicas of worldwide landmarks, including the Great Pyramids, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, a miniature Manhattan, and, most prominently, the Eiffle Tower, or rather the young people who work there. It is clear to see from the film how this concept was appealing. At times images such as workers carrying water containers through a miniature Egypt (complete with camel) strike the appropriate, and affective, somewhat surreal tone. But sadly, for the most part it seems as if Jia Zhang Ke relied on the unique location too much, using it as a gimmick, and a crutch for the weak, cliché storytelling. Too often he relies on repetitive, obvious imagery, as well, such as a frequent shots of the replica Eiffle Tower against the Beijing skyline. Also present, I should mention, were pointless on-screen captions, dividing the film into meaningless sections. All and all the film was far from terrible though, and to it's credit it never quite followed through with the terrible situations it sometimes set up, and which I suspected. For example, a plot line involving immigrant Russian workers at the park was left mercifully underdeveloped, although not enough to avoid a bit of embarrassing melodrama. Still, it never got as bad as I was expecting it to, although that is a rather under-handed comment I know. The film's best moments tended to be when the story left the park and moved into the city itself, ironically enough, although it all really amounted to too little too late. Not even the nice (if not incredible) widescreen cinematography could save it from relative mediocrity. Looking back, it's funny and a bit sad to think that the film's best moments were it's opening ones, where Jia Zhang Ke's sense of the comedy of repetition (displayed so brilliantly in ""Unknown Pleasues"") were in full display."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"""However, the most affecting and indelible impression is the universal sense of displacement, acedia and resignation, and the rapport Tao strikes with fellow Russian dancer Anna (Shcherbakova), a leitmotif crying ""lost in translation"" human understanding. THE WORLD might rightly pander to an occidental viewpoint of an emerging, monolithic, oriental economic threat and its benumbed populace living in their own shallow world, a mock version of what those fortunate citizens dwelling in the developed countries. That's one crucial reason the film is reckoned as a minor film from Jia, he can't be arsed to even suggest the resilient spirit that aids people through gray days, in lieu, what he tries to evoke is a downcast sneer and a God's view superiority, two years later STILL LIFE (2006) would satisfactorily rectify this error.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"While not as good as some of his previous films, The World is still an excellent movie. Imagine a soap opera director (or a TV ad director) making Italian Neo-realism, and you'll get the right feel. Zhang Ke has a talent to make you feel relieved or even elated while showing reality at its most bleak. He is one of the best directors operating today, none of his films should be missed.The opening scene in which Tao Zhao asks for a band-aid, dressed in an over-the-top Indian costume, is powerful and touching (and in a way, summarizes the entire film). It is one of Zhang Ke's most memorable scenes (alongside the one in which Hong Wei Wang is cuffed to a street lamp by the policeman in Xiao Wu). There seem to be two versions of this film. In one we get to see the World Park's manager confiscating passports from the Russian female workers, and promoting a girl in exchange for sleeping with her, in the other version those scenes were cut (and so it's probably the official Chinese version)."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"Definitely not for everyone as it's (a) incredibly slow and (b) long (2 hours and 13 mins on the DVD I rented and (c) has some story lines that absolutely do not work.The cinematography is amazing as having been to Beijing, it truly feels like it when they are out and about. That low-level lighting at night just evokes the whole place. The amusement park is classic but it seems half empty. That's the thing, this is a movie that takes place in Beijing, a city of millions, yet where are the people? The relationships--some work, some don't--but what gets me is some people who try to portray this movie as some sort of comment on globalization. All I see is what has been going on for centuries in most Third World countries--people from the countryside move to the big cities to find a better life. Some do, some don't.The whole movie seems more like a documentary look into people's lives and that is a credit to the acting.But really, if you haven't been to Asia, I can't really see this being worthwhile renting because it moves at a snail's pace and seems intended for those who love to read meaning into everything. All I got out of it was--wow, why didn't I go check out this place called The World when I was in Beijing. It's even more bizarre than Huis Ten Bosch or Canadaland or the other weird Western land ripoff amusement parks I visited in Japan."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"The story of young people at a world theme park in Beijing called The World (Shi Jie Gong Yuan).The park contains scale models of the Eiffel Tower, the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Leaning Tower of Pisa etc. The motto is that you can see the world without leaving Beijing. The film details the lives of the young workers there, focusing in particular on the ups and downs of a couple of relationships. Other events: a group of Russian girls arrives to work there; a couple of young men from the countryside come looking for employment; petty corruption and the tragedy of those at the lower part of the economic scale are part of the mix as well. Like other Jia's films, there is not a lot here in terms of plot. But you are nevertheless drawn into the lives of the characters. Just like you can see the world without leaving Beijing, so you can go deeply into the lives of these characters without needing a lot of action to occur. Some don't like Jia's work because of its slow pacing. But I find his work engrossing. His ""Still Life"" (""San xia hao ren"") is my favorite Chinese film. I don't want his movies to move any faster than they do."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"This movie is set in a theme park in China, where some of the more famous monuments of the world (the Eiffel tower, the Statue of Liberty) are reproduced in a much reduced scale. Meanwhile, the workers at the park live empty, unsatisfying lives, overburdened with work and empty of personal projects for the future. The main point of this movie seems to be that capitalism and modernization might have brought prosperity to some in China, but not to the majority of the Chinese people, and in any case it has left the country spiritually void, without a common goal for the people with the exception of making money. Director Jia Zhang-Ke might be right in his analysis, but did he need to tell this story in such a ponderous, gloomy manner?."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"I have watched almost every movie made by the director Zhangke Jia(贾樟 柯), and I believe this one is among one of his best(IMHO his best is 'Still Life(三峡好人)'). The characters in this movie are all lower class people, probably the lowest class of modern Chinese society. Amazingly, director figured out a way to express their feelings, alone and abandoned, desires, etc. Unfortunately, in order to get the movie focused on characters, Jia Zhangke got rid of probably all the dark sides of society. That is to say, get the tragedy limited to the characters themselves as much as possible. Anyway, Zhangke Jia's movies are always not supposed to criticize but to express.Zhangke Jia's style is a mixture of realism, fantasy and expressionism, so if couldn't catch up with his film the first time, I strongly suggest you to watch it again, his films are worthy of several hours of your time. Years later, his films could be a lot more valuable, since he is the only director still focusing on the bottom of the society in china nowadays."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"This is a story set in Beijing, specifically ""World Park"", a theme park which features replicas of famous buildings/monuments of the world. The slogan is ""See the world without leaving Beijing"". The story revolves around various workers at the park. I really wanted to enjoy this film, which starts out fairly strong, but then goes on too long. The characters are fairly ordinary, with ordinary life problems/situations, and I wanted more intrigue. I like the idea of the film, but there should have been a more interesting story line. It looks great, it is shot great. However, I finished the film just shrugging my shoulders. This is a case of could have been so much better. Six stars for effort, but ultimately not that great."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"I had expected more from this film after really enjoying director Zhangke Jia's far more compelling work from 2002, ""Unknown Pleasures.""""The World"" has glitzier production values, but a far less coherent story and no characters of any discernible depth or real interest. If an hour of this bloated and repetitious production had been cut, it might have been far better.The movie takes us to an actual theme park in Beijing with replicas of iconic monuments like the Eiffel Tower and the World Trade Center. The protagonist, played by Tao Zhao, is a dancer in a lavish spectacle at the park and we must watch scenes from the show repeatedly as the story plods along. Why? The show has nothing to do with Chinese culture and the dancers seem like they belong on a fashion runway somewhere. It's hard to see the director's point. Anyway, we follow Tao through some uninteresting scenes with a guy (Taishen Cheng) who followed her to Bejing and seems to have a sexual interest in Tao as long as she is not interested. As soon as Tao shows a little interest in this sap, he embarks on an affair with a wealthy married woman, another liaison that isn't really credible.Along the way there are bizarre scenes that make no sense. For example, there is a Russian performer at the theme park who seems to have taken a sisterly interest in Tao. She speaks Russian, Tao responds in Mandarin, and they both shed tears as if they have understood each other. C'mon, ain't no way they've learned each other's languages!There are many red herrings in the movie. For example, we see one guy practically stalking his girlfriend, another performer at the theme park. When she tells him to get lost, he sets his jacket on fire. And the next thing we know, this happy couple has married. Yeah, right. The director tries to get ""deep"" on us by taking timeouts throughout the film to switch to cartoonish interludes. It makes no sense at all.At one point in the action, a cards-playing man opines, ""Women should never be spoiled. Ignore them and they come running back."" Interesting philosophy. Maybe that explained Tao's actions with her guy. It seems they get back together in the film's last frames, but it is filmed so darkly it's impossible to know. What an exercise in frustration!"
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"I vacillated in my review between 1 (awful) and 2 (not quite awful, I suppose). This movie has no plot to speak of. Someone compared it to ""Hester Street"" and ""Atlantic City"" in the way ""it achingly proves the universality of the twin globalization pulls of modernization and immigration over the past three hundred years around the world."" The exception is that those two fine movies have plots and characters you care about. That same reviewer said it ""is one of the saddest films I've ever seen . ."" I agree with that. I was sad, too, that I had to sit through this melancholy non-story filled with vapid characters. Go see this movie if you want a good nap."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"This might be a decent example of why many filmgoers are resistant to foreign, world, or art cinema. The World seems to have something to say, wrapped in a veneer of profundity, but it feels so vapid and trite. Is this shallowness part of the critique, part of the point? The American Psycho novel, somewhat replicated by the film adaptation as well, featured a shallow and consumption-obsessed psychopath who waxed on and on about the most inane pop music and other disposable aspects of culture; even if it was a bit tiresome to wade through, it played into a feedback loop that solidified certain conceptual pretensions from the author; I don't count myself a fan particularly, but I can see one arguing successfully that what I didn't like about the book was one of its strengths. Perhaps that's the same for Zhangke's The World? I don't know, but I'll get into why I don't care, and most viewers probably wouldn't either.To begin with, the core premise and setting are interesting. China has made a grand amusement park with downscaled versions of famous monuments from around the world, including London's Big Ben, America's NY city scape before the twin towers fell, Italy's Leaning Tower of Pisa, India's Taj Mahal, France's Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, among others. It would appear that the vast array of characters who work at the park would be used to explore Chinese identity or what have you in relation to not just a rapidly modernizing China, but the world, as symbolized by the park that promises you to see the entire world without leaving the comfort of Beijing.But... what are we left with other than typically sad sack and alienated art film characters wandering a landscape that is well-shot, but often gray, bleak, and dreary? You'd think there was nothing to making an art film other than having your characters mope a little with a blank expression, hiring a top-notch cinematographer, long stretches of silence and slowness, and stringing a script together that's not much more than ""something something modernization + I'm really awkward and have a hard time communicating with others.""The plotting is pretty much a random assemblage of scenes, though there is some progression that prevents it from being a mere series of vignettes. The animated interludes look striking in their own way and are well done (the flying woman looks kind of bad, though), but don't seem to add much otherwise and seem out of place. The story centers around a couple named Tao and Taisheng, a couple... in love? They are confused about what they want in their pursuit of love and the relationship seems ephemeral as a result. Like most people in the movie, they don't communicate so well.Most of the other characters are less important and aren't given much screen time in comparison. There's an unrequited love between two others that ends with coercion, a very hollow and fake friendship between a Russian woman and Tao, and a man who promptly passes away in a workplace accident, probably for the sole reason of reflecting on the rampant amount of similar incidents and the seeming disposability of workers in China.The World is long, moves at a snail's pace, and the emptiness left me feeling empty. Good job. The ending is... interesting, I guess. Not sure what to make of it, though it is quite surreal and almost out of place for what is often a quite realistic film, sans the animations, which, on second thought, are perhaps meant as preparation for the unexpected ending."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"From the long take at the opening of the film, with the camera following protagonist Tao strolling down the hallway repeatedly asking: 'Does anyone have a Bandaid?', I knew I was in for an extraordinary film experience. Two hours later this was validated.Make no mistake. This film is not for everyone - it is slow, has no action scenes, and the language is foreign to many. But director Jia Zhangke told his story with no fanfare and with precision. The people in the film are ordinary people - young migrants from a less prosperous part of the country coming to Beijing in the hope of making a better living and working in a theme park. Once settled they encouraged their family members and relatives to do the same. The comradeship among these migrants was strong - they felt obligated to look after one another. And when tragedy struck, grief was shared by many.Jia's work was frowned upon by the China authorities, and I think I know they reason why - Jia did such a good job in exposing the 'imperfections' of modern day Chinese society. From the soft-toned recording welcoming visitors to the mock-up Eiffel Tower, played repeatedly to the extend it became extremely annoying, to the paid-out of 300,000 yuan (less then $5,000) against a young life lost due to an industrial accident, we see the imbalance and injustice in the society. Yes, in a country of 1.3B people life is cheap. But when you see the dollar value assigned to this young man, nicked name 'second sister' lovingly by his parents who yearned for a girl at his birth, one cannot but feel despondent about a society demonstrating visible wealth, and yet endorsing such an unfair valuation of life. And Jia wants us to know this through his film, whether we care about it or not.This is film to watch and to ponder upon. It is about love and life for the ordinary, young generation in China. You will see they face challenges just like their counterparts in other parts of the world. And yet some of these challenges may have a flavour unique to China. The viewer is the one to make that association. I highly recommend this film to serious film fans who want to see something different for a change - an art-house piece with a cultural twist."
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"The World is a Chinese independent film with an ambitious concept that didn't quite make it. At all. It opens with an obscure sequence of events and not much else. The characters are low budget workers and dancers in Beijing's The World park. Perhaps the biggest flaw within the film is just how flat and uninspired the main characters are. It doesn't help when random names and faces appear at any given time; it was difficult to remember what the plot was- before you realize that there is no plot. The animated sequences were distracting and visually contradicting. I admit they were cleverly executed but did not seem to serve much purpose otherwise. The dancing/elaborate costumes clashed horribly with the drab scenery. There were way too many pointless scenes that contributed nothing to anything. What was up with the scene where Tao is cast as an African woman? What did that have to do with anything? And I did not care for the friendship of Anna and Tao. It struggled to be heartfelt because they did not speak the same language, but only succeeded in boring me half to death. I did not know what to make of the ending. What did it have to do with anything? I felt that the movie had a lot of potential to start off with, but there was no character or plot development. It tried too hard to make you aware of ""industriliazation"" and ""modernization"" but it really didn't add up to much of anything. I suppose you like watching Chinese people talk/walk/dance/text message, then this is the film for you. 3/10"
世界,The World (2004),,2004,2005.07.01,"I watch this film in conjunction with a course on urbanization in modern China. In my opinion, the film drags on forever with little discernible plot.After about 30 minutes, I just prayed that it would end. The""significance"" of the film if completely overshadowed by no real character development, and the message regarding immigrant workers is completely unrealistic. Someone from Russia with no knowledge of Chinese would form a deep friendship with a Chinese person with no knowledge of Russian. The way the two characters ""understand"" one-another when they babble at one-another in languages that are far from mutually intelligible is just frustratingly fake."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Good films depict feelings truthfully; with great works of art, you experience emotions deep within yourself. Zhang Yimou's ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" is not only a three-hankie movie, it may leave you with a sense of being changed, of being connected to others in new ways. It is that powerful, that important a work.""Only connect"" - E.M. Forster's imperative for creating ties - is at the heart of Zhang's new film, but with a twist. Takata, the central character, is an elderly Japanese, seemingly unconnected to anyone, a man with a frozen face and heart, long estranged from his only son, who has now fallen gravely ill. Ken Takakura, one of the most majestic actors alive (an ideal - perhaps the only - Lear around), is Takata, his uncommunicative, stony presence compelling attention and generating a mix of apprehension and pity.Takata's journey to China's Yunnan province to complete his son's filming of the legendary song ""Qian li zou dan qi,"" that gave the film its title, is full of twists and turns. Zhang tells the story with honesty, integrity, and Parsifal's ""wisdom through compassion."" In a brilliant stroke, Zhang opens and closes the film with the same scene - Takata, motionless, gazing over the confluence of gray sea and sky - but he, along with the audience, is in a completely different place, the unchanged exterior masking a person richly transformed by daring, risk-taking humanity.Zhang, a master of producing a variety of genres and styles, put everything into this work (except the wushu grandeur of ""Hero"" and the upcoming ""Curse of the Golden Flower"") - the broad sweep of ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" the chamber music of ""The Road Home,"" the joyful melodrama of ""Happy Times,"" and a dozen other works.""Riding Alone"" is adventure, psychological drama, a ""quest film,"" unveiling spectacular vistas and the deep divisions/underlying connections between individuals and civilizations. And yet, through all this, ""Riding Alone"" is all of one piece, a grand novel in tightly connected (but ever-surprising) chapters, a 19th century literary saga in a 21st century setting.If the film were presented in a series of silent close-ups of Takakura, it would be glorious enough, but the bonus is an army of non-professional actors, in addition to the magnificent Shinobu Terajima as Takata's daughter-in-law; Qiu Lin as Lingo, the would-be interpreter; Jiang Wen as Jasmine, the accomplished translator; Yang Zhenbo as Yang Yang, an amazing child star in a pivotal role; and Chinese-opera star Li Jiamin as himself.If you're looking for a detailed story line, you will not find it here. Why would you deny yourself the pleasure of being taken along on a superb, heartwarming ride of surprise and discovery?"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"In a village of fishermen in Japan, Takata (Ken Takakura) misses his son Kenichi, to whom he has been estranged for many years. When his daughter-in-law Rie (Shinobu Terajima) tells him that Kenichi is sick in the hospital, she suggests Takata to come to Tokyo to visit his son in the hospital where he would have the chance to retie the relationship. However, Kenichi refuses to receive his father in his room, and Rie gives a videotape to Takata to know about the work of his son. Once at home, Takata sees a documentary in the remote village Lijiang, in the province of Younnan, about the passion of Kenichi, the Chinese opera, where the lead singer Li Jiamin (Jiamin Li) promises to sing an important folk opera on the next year. When Rie calls Takata to tell that her husband has a terminal liver cancer, Takata decides to travel to Lijiang to shoot Li Jiamin singing the opera to give to Kenichi.""Qian Li Zou Dan Qi"" is a magnificent movie about fathers and sons in a wonderful journey to understanding and redemption that will certainly bring tears and smiles to the viewer. The screenplay perfectly discloses in an adequate pace the touching and heartbreaking story of a man that tries reconciliation with his son filming the opera in China and finally understands the feelings of his son. It is also a story about lost chances in life to be close to those we love since people usually forget that time is irreversible and life is unique. The cinematography is amazing, as usual in Yimou Zhang movies. Ken Takakura gives a top-notch performance supported by the excellent acting of a few professional actors and actresses and an amateurish cast. The music score is very peaceful and beautiful. I have just included this gem in the list of my favorite movies ever. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Um Longo Caminho"" (""A Long Way"")"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Getting into the human equation and away from acrobatic flying daggers, director Yimou Zhang spins solid gold in his latest film, RIDING ALONE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES.Set against the stunningly picturesque Yunnan Province in southwestern China, Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) leaves his beloved Japanese fishing village to travel thousands of miles and finish video recording a famous Chinese folk opera for his dying son.Mr. Takata and his son have become distant since the death of Mr. Takata's wife, not speaking to one another for years. When word comes to him that his son, Ken-ichi, is in the hospital, Mr. Takata races to the city only to be rebuffed by his son's bitterness. Mr. Takata never sees his Ken-ichi, but his son's wife, Rie (Shinobu Terajima), tells Mr. Takata an interesting story about his love of Chinese folk dancing. She hands him an unfinished tape of Ken-ichi's work and, after watching it, Mr. Takata decides to finish the recording. ""Not being good with people,"" Mr. Takata immediately encounters problems when he enters China. But he learns quickly, and finds humility within himself in order to finish the tape.Mr. Takata knew that his son wanted to film one particular opera (also called Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles) sung by one particular Chinese man named Li. But Li is in prison after stabbing a man. Getting permission to film Li performing the folk dance from the government higher-ups becomes one of Mr. Takata's earliest obstacles. Then, after gaining access, Mr. Li has a meltdown, thinking about his own distant son. Emotional beyond repair, Mr. Li is unable to dance for Mr. Takata. So Mr. Takata leaves to come back another day ...but an idea is sparked in his head.Mr. Takata goes to ""The Stone Village"" to see if he can convince Mr. Li's five-year-old son to come back with him to the prison so that he can visit. What follows is one of the most emotionally impacting moments in Chinese film history. Unable to be close to his own son, Mr. Takata transfers much of his emotional heft onto young Yang Yang (Mr. Li's son), and audiences will no doubt spill plenty of tears as this happens.The beauty of the surrounding countryside in the Yunnan Province is an awesome spectacle to behold; a backdrop that towers in all its majesty.Ken Takakura deserves Oscar mention for his quiet yet powerful (and heartbreaking) role as the conflicted and determined Mr. Takata.All of the other actors are not actors, though. They are ordinary people picked by the director for their appearances and mannerisms; excellently done by the way. There's little doubt most will know that none of them have acting experience unless DVD watchers click on the extra features.A brilliantly done foreign film that proves director Yimou Zhang isn't just an action freak."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"The poetic opening of ""Riding Along for Thousand of Miles"" shows a pensive Takata at the edge of the sea in a remote fishing village where he now lives. Having left his wife and child earlier in his life has estranged his relationship with his only son Kenichi, a film maker, who is now sick at a Tokyo hospital. When Riu, his daughter-in-law calls, he doesn't hesitate to go to his son's side. At the hospital, Kenichi doesn't want to see his father, who goes away hurt.After Riu has given Takata a tape of his son's film on Chinese opera, which he loves, and was not able to finish, he suddenly decides to surprise Kenichi with a film where he will capture this opera for him. Little prepares the older Takata for what he will find. First, what appeared to be an easy task, becomes a project in which Takata was not counting on.When Takata is told about his son's death, he becomes even more passionate in finishing the job for what he came to a remote spot in China, even when he has to fight the local bureaucracy and the red tape he finds is hindering him from what he came to get. Basically, this story is about the guilt Takata feels for abandoning his only son. When Takata learns that the main opera singer Li Jiamin is in prison and his small son Yang Yang is unhappy as he will be sent away, it makes him more resolute to finish the job.Director Yimou Zhang shows why he is one of the best Chinese directors of his generation. Mr. Zhang takes us for a magical ride into a culture to meet its richness and the wonderful Chinese people, who are no different from Tanaka, or from us, for that matter. The brilliant photography by Zhao Xiaoding, showing splendid views of the mountains in Yunan province, are too beautiful for words.The film was a tribute to that marvelous Japanese actor, Ken Takakura, one of the giants in that country's cinema. There is not a false move from Mr. Takakura throughout the film. He is worth the price of admission. Shinobu Terajima is seen briefly as Riu. Jiamin Li, Liu Qui, Jian Wen, and the cute Zhenbo Yang, who appears as Yang Yang, contribute to make the film the joy it is.Yimou Zhang clearly demonstrates why he is one of the best."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"A young Japanese film maker is in hospital in Tokyo. His estranged father tries to visit, but the son refuses to see him. So, as a gesture of reconciliation, the father decides to go to China to complete the filming of a Chinese opera, called ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles,"" which the son was working on but unable to finish. But the master singer whom the son was most interested in filming is now in jail, so official permission must be granted. And then the singer has a breakdown because he wants to see his own young son who is way off in the country somewhere. So the Japanese father now has to travel distances to find the son of the singer. A strong and beautiful film as one would expect from master director Yinou Zhang, it is a tale of one man's journey both into the world and into himself. In a way, it's a road movie, but there's more than one kind of road involved. Unlike his more dramatic fantasies, this is a quiet and haunting story, filled with stunning images from the hidden heart of China. Highly recommended."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"'Qian li zou dan qi' ('Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles') is a little miracle of a film by the gifted Chinese director Yimou Zhang, an artist highly respected for his films of passion and martial arts captured in richly symbolic fashion and spectacular color. But in this film the director joins in writing a story with Jingzhi Zou that is as intimate as his other films are operatic. It is a simple, touching story told in manner that maintains Zhang's visual artistry yet goes so far beyond the glorious color to probe universal questions.Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) lives by himself in a fishing village since the death of his wife. Apparently he was so devastated by her passing that he left his son Ken-ichi to grow up by himself, an act that Ken-ichi has never forgiven: the two men have had no contact in many years. Takata receives a telephone call from his daughter-in-law Rie (Shinobu Terajima) informing him that Ken-ichi is hospitalized with a grave illness and pleads with Takata to come visit his estranged son. Takata complies, but on arrival at the hospital his son refuses to see him. Rie shares a videotape Ken-ichi made about his obsession with Chinese folk opera, and when Takata plays the tape he sees that his son's burning desire to tape a performance by Chinese singer Li Jiamin (who plays himself) singing the greatest of his roles - an opera names 'Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles' - was thwarted by the singer's illness at the time, Takata decides to reconcile his paternal distance and travel to Yunnan Province of China to complete his son's tape and vision.Upon arrival in China Takata discovers that the singer is in jail and he obtains the translator services of Lingo (Lin Qiu) and Jasmine (Jiang Wen) who ultimately help him to overcome the endless red tape to gain an audience with the singer in his jail. Though Li wants to sing his famous role of Takata to film for his son, Li requests that first he be able to see his illegitimate son Yang Yang (Zhenbo Yang) who has been adopted by a little village called Stone Flower. Takata, with the aid of his translators, visits Stone Flower and the people there greet Takata with warmth and give their consent to allow Yang Yang to accompany Takata to see the father he has never met. But on the road out of China Yang Yang strays and Takata and Yang Yang spend a night in the frightening depths of a canyon: they bond with complex shared needs until they are rescued the next morning. Though Yang Yang has developed a love for Takata he doesn't want to leave his village and Takata departs back to the prison alone to tell Li. At the prison Takata shares with Li and his fellow inmates photographs of Yang Yang: everyone is so moved that Li performs the opera for Takata's son on videotape as a gesture of love.Takata has accomplished his mission of reconciliation with his own son, but Rie calls him to inform him that Ken-ichi has died but left a letter addressed to Takata that explains how deeply moved the son is that his father would make the journey to China, riding alone for thousands of miles out of love. The gesture is enough for Ken-ichi.Zhang tells his story in both Mandarin and Japanese and the translations reflect the differences on the two countries but also represent bridges between the ancient and the modern, between cold interior calloused heart and the warmth of love. The filming and accompanying musical score are as always in Zhang's films beautiful beyond description. This is a film to cherish, one that is so understated in its approach to father-son relationships that it will touch chords of recognition in every viewer. Highly recommended. Grady Harp"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Thankfully Zhang, Yimou is back to make another deeply moved and typical ""Zhang's Style"" movie and it is wise for him to stop producing further martial art films.Ken Takakura is acting as Takada, a Japanese fishman whose son is diagnosed incurable disease but refuses to see him for the past unsolvable conflicts between them. Following the clue left on the video tape made by the son, Takada decides to travel thousands of miles from Japan to Li Jiang (Beautiful River) of Yun'nan Province in China, to complete his son's unfinished wish - to shoot a local drama played by local artist Li, Jianmin. After he arrived, a series of unexpected difficulties and events happened between him and local tour guide Qiu, Lin, love child Yangyang and opera actor Li, Jiamin among the other local residents, lead Takada to deeply think and comprehend the relationship between him and his son, and during this process his son finally forgive him from the past.Audience can not only enjoy the familiar rural scene brought by Zhang, Yimou, but also the superb genuine performances brought by those actors who are just acting with their real names(and Zhang has done this before in previous movies) apart from Ken Takakura. The dialogues are superb, they can be amused, grieved, touched and thoughtful.It is a rare movie that I can't wait to give my thumb up half-way before the end, and a must-see film can make you smile and giggle with the tears and weeps."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"My extremely limited knowledge of Asian cinema revolves almost entirely around that of South Korea; ignorance is a word which quickly springs to mind when considering both Japan and China. Having just last night endured the interminably fatuous nonsense of the Japanese Desu Nôto, I was somewhat afeared of returning so soon to that country.Qian Li Zou Dan Qi tells the tale of the elderly Mr Takata, who journeys from his native Japan to a small Chinese village in order to record the titular mask opera for the benefit of his terminally ill son, from whom he is a decade estranged.Now, obviously one terrifically awful film does not an awful national cinema make. However, I genuinely was a little put off by the prospect of watching another Japanese film so soon after the preceding opprobrium. Qian Li Zou Dan Qi begins with a combination of impressive and foreboding elements: its cinematography is immediately impressive; its apparent reliance on voice-over narration to express its main character's thoughts a little primal. Both of these remain, to some extent, present throughout the film, the former continually providing breathtaking visuals, the latter offering a slight detraction to the film's potential effect. To dwell on one for a moment, the rurality of the Chinese settings provides beauty aplenty for the camera, and we with it, to gaze upon. Many are the times wherein mountainous landscapes offer a stunningly beautiful accompaniment to the oriental soundtrack, the two combining to create a powerful and moving aesthetic which, the more the film goes on, demonstrates director Yimou Zhang's artistic mastery. Aside from the opening shot, the earlier parts of the film seem to lack a distinct visual prowess, but fret not, this is more than made up for by the end. Several times, the visuals convey thematic ideas to us through a combination of sky-spanning cinematography and telling blocking (wonderful to see that element of mise-en-scène utilised well), yet this is marred somewhat mere seconds later by the voice-over presenting the same ideas. Whilst I accept that this may be an accessibility issue—cinematic language is not one universally spoken—I did feel the film could have got along perfectly without narration at all, though it is by no means a serious flaw. The theme of paternal stoicism is one which I find inherently interesting at the worst of times, and is here given a fascinating treatment, the entirety of the film's effect hinged upon Ken Takakura's beautifully subtle performance. A gentle comedy permeates the film's dramatic layers, but always finds itself immediately overturned by the sombre drama of Takakura's face, which speaks volumes upon volumes with the simplest of motions. A wonderful element of the film comes in the form of the mask opera's singer's son, and the concomitant metaphorical representation of the relationship between Takata and his own son, an interesting and wholly effective means of presenting an otherwise unrealised dynamic. The film's eventual conclusion is tear-inducingly moving, capping a story that is described encompassingly in a single, simple word: lovely.A very finely shot film which knows how to talk to its audience with images rather than words, yet still somewhat disappointingly opts to employ them, Qian Li Zou Dan Qi is a touching Japanese/Chinese co-production which attests to the beauty of both nations' rural landscapes and cultural aspects, as well as offering a genuinely moving, poignantly performed, and universally relevant tale."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Ken Takakura can probably be a one-man hall of fame in Japan. Western audience will remember him most as the introvert detective of impeccable integrity who teams up with Michael Douglas in Black Rain (1989). Asian audience will remember him in his more recent work Poppoya (1999), where his portray of a dedicated railroader and a remorseful father does not leave a single pair of dry eyes in each and every screening. At the age of 75, he came out of retirement and went to China to make a picture (which he's never done before) that does not have one single professional actor besides himself. What enticed him to this folly? Zhang Yimou must be an important reason, if not the only reason.Many hail ""Riding alone for a thousand miles"" as Zhang's return to his true self after making ""Heroes"" which is technically flashy but somewhat lacking in content, followed by ""House of flying daggers"" which is technically flashy and completely devoid of any meaningful content whatsoever. I welcome the Zhang in ""Riding"" but do not think it's really the same director that we used to know. The clock simply cannot be turned back and the times are changing. In ""Riding"" Zhang has brought us something new. It remains to be debated if this new film, which has been very successful in both China and Japan, is as honest as his earlier ones before the two disasters.The story is simple. In a beautiful but lonely coastal village lives Takada (Ken Takakura), a fisherman who had deserted the city and not been in communication with his son for ten years. A call from his considerate daughter-in-law brings him to the hospital, only to find his son in sick bed refusing to see him. She gives him a video tape containing his son's TV program shot in Yunnan, to ease his disappointment. When the diagnosis of terminal cancer comes, Takada decides to go to Yunnan to finish shooting the performance of a Chinese opera singer, something that his son did not have time to do on the last expedition. The story is mainly on what he encounters in Yunnan on this quest. Zhang touches on several things in this contemporary story.First of all, the main theme is clearly father-and-son, explored in not just one, but two stories. True to his old form, Zhang take a minimalized approach, which suits Takakura well. The other story is about the Chinese opera singer and his eight-year-old son. The interesting thing is that in the movie, we never see either pair of father and son together, but instead interaction between Takada and the little boy culminating in a touching parting scene.There is good depth in the relationship between Takada and his son although the only communication we see in the movie is through his daughter-in-law. We are not told details of what led to the alienation between father and son but get a general understanding that the problem is rooted in both being stubbornly unwilling to reveal their feelings. When Takada finally goes to Yunnan, he finds out from people that his son was very much a loner there, being isolated by cultural and language barriers. It's by going through the same experience of loneliness that he finally feels being close to his son. On the other hand, when the son hears that his father is in Yunnan, it's not only just the appreciation of what is being done, but also (maybe even more importantly) the realization that his father is experiencing the same loneliness he once experienced before. He finally wants to see his father.There are other things that Zhang has touched on. He is trying to show a modernized China, not so much on the material plane, but more on the mind set of the common people in the remote province. The obstacles Takada encounters initially are, although bureaucratic, not that unreasonable, and due a lot to just language barrier. People are genuinely kind and helpful, particularly after they have heard his tragic story. It's interesting that all the other actors use their real names in the movie, and probably play their real-life roles: tour company translator, local tour guide, government officials, village elders, probably even the prisoners! The cultural and language barrier here are portrayed as nothing more than a natural situation which can be easily overcome - e.g. finding a rooftop (probably the only one) in the remote village which gets cell phone signals so that Takada can call the tourist company translator for help in instant translation. To the ordinary people in the remote village in Yunnan, the arrival of a Japanese visitor is a great honour and the entire village is out to welcome him in a big feast.Zhang has brought us something very different from anything we've seen from him before. Other than the tragic nature of the main story and the sad father-son alienation in the two story lines, this is an unabashed feel good movie. Let others be skeptical and cynical about it. Personally, I see nothing wrong with it."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"As a long-time Zhang Yimou fan, I was pleased to see his most recent work depart from the Hero/ House of Flying Daggers genre and return to what I see as ""classic"" Zhang Yimou-- deceivingly simple films about personal struggle and transformation which are marked by their tenacious sense of humanism, stunning cinematography, and subtle political and social undertones.Qian Li Zhou Dan Qi is a story about a father's (Ken Takakura's) journey to mend his relationship with his estranged son (voiced by Kiichi Nakai). It is a journey that transpires on two levels: Takada's physical voyage from a minimalist Japanese fishing village to a vibrant region of Yunnan Province China spurs an emotional progression that thaws his benumbed emotions for his son. Kiichi Nakai's character is never seen on screen and remains an abstraction; the son-figure is instead incarnated by a young boy of a remote village, fathered illegitimately by the opera singer whom Takada seeks to film. By learning to embrace the young boy, his hidden paternal love is manifested, and Takada, ever the stoic Hemingway man, is vicariously able to come to terms with his relationship with his own son.The most gripping part of this film is Ken Takakura's performance. The range and depth of the actor's emotions was just what Zhang Yimou endeavored to capture in this film, and indeed, Takakura's dignity and gravitas permeates every minute of it. The camera delineates his face with great diligence and grace in the style of Zhang Yimou's The Road Home (1999) and earlier Gong Li films. Paired with visual imagery of Japan's coast and Yunnan's mountains and terrain, the picture is, as usual, a credit to Zhang Yimou's distinctive talent as director and ex-cinematographer.Much has been said about the politics of Zhang Yimou's films. Since Qian Li Zhou Dan Qi deals with the touchy issues of state censorship and the Chinese prison system and presents them in an ultimately favorable light, it may appear that this film serves as propaganda for the Chinese government, which was an objection raised about Not One Less (1999). But even as a viewer who prefers to focus on Zhang Yimou's artistry and artistic expression rather than his ""hidden political agenda,"" it would be rash to ignore the subtly subversive, wry irony interspersed in this film. No candy coating is painted upon the stiff policies of the state, which forbid foreigners from observing the internal workings of the prison system. The image of prisoners marching and chanting a din of self-improvement, reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution era, is equally stark. But beyond the state is the individual, and in this film as in many of Zhang Yimou's others, it is the triumph of the individual outside of his context that rings true.What I disliked about this film, however, is that it seems Zhang Yimou has a tried-and-true formula which works, and works well, but which makes Qian Li Zhou Dan Qi feel slightly recycled (this probably wouldn't present a problem to those unfamiliar with his other films). The theme of a persistent individual's journey past bureaucracy and dispassion was explored in The Story of Qiu Ju (1992) and Zhang Yimou's use of local non-actors was a repeat from Not One Less. Moreover, this film does not escape the slowly-simmering tragic element that, though beautiful, is characteristically Zhang Yimou. I tended to enjoy the more circuitous route to tragedy in Happy Times (2000). But bottom line: after the martial arts movies secured his international fame, Zhang Yimou has created a film reminiscent of his earlier work, truly representative of his talent & vision, and which will probably receive more widespread attention deservedly so."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"It has been a long time since Zhang last pull an intimate angle on his film. It feels good to watch a simple story that filled our emotions right to the brim. If i'm not wrong. this is the first time Zhang focus on MAN's emotion. His protagonist have always been females. (The 2 most famous actress from china - gongli and zhang ziyi is a result of his great foresight.) Zhang Yimou possess a good eye for casting. Both old man and little boy exudes certain stunning charisma that i find them look alike to each other. Both possess a ruggard face that reads hardship and strength. Ironically these man and boy of rock are hit by the softness of kinship. whatever it is, they stand tall in the face of sad history. watching the heart map of a solid MAN like takakura is one of the most touching thing for me. i was moved by the story. it was so rare to watch the male characters to be dissect by Zhang. When that happens, they are much pale (quiet & reserved) in comparison to the other female characters in zhang's previous film. for me, that is novelty. kudos to zhang for reinventing himself!"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Returning to more character based storytelling, Yimou Zhang eschews the heavy production and vibrant action that has characterized his latest martial artsy films such as Hero in favor of this lower-key drama which tells the tale of one father's journey on a unique road trip throughout China. Although it would seem that this movie has many of the ingredients making for the profound film experience Riding Alone For Thousands Of Miles attempts to be, way too much falls flat here unfortunately.Right from the abrupt introduction, one may sense something is quite not right for the tone of this film. Often lingering with beautifully shot imagery throughout nature, the script awkwardly contradicts this flow, feeling rushed, underdeveloped, and poorly written all at the same time, despite the sensitive and introspective pace Zhang was trying to achieve. The gentle performance of veteran Japanese actor Ken Takakura, while providing a pleasant enough diversion for a typical protagonist, simply does not have the energy to carry the film based on an extremely limited range of output here. His highly stoic demeanor does have it's subtle charm, but ultimately did not convey much of the emotional depth a heartfelt climax wished to culminate with. Likewise, many of the film's more emotionally heavy scenes, while thematically feeling strong, are certainly exploited and rendered less resonant by the unfortunate pandering that one feels the director is trying to impose on more sensitive types.Sometimes, a director will know how to take material to a more personal realm, but here it just feels like whenever an important revelation or parallel to the main character's family life is in play, the execution becomes even more heavy handed and manipulative then the usually slow pace. It is too bad writing and direction cannot match the heart of this work, since the story itself is a beautiful one."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"After he learned his son was in the hospital, Takada hurried to see his son. However his son refused to see him because of their long time bad relationship. His son's wife gave him a box of videotape that was his son's work about China. After finished watching the tape, Takada made up his mind to go to China to make a video recording for a Chinese traditional opera that his son missed. He hoped he could improve his relationship with his son by doing this.Sometimes heart-to-heart talking is hard because we are used to hide our true feeling. In fact we are afraid of showing our weakness to other people. If we can abandon the bad habit, we can live an easier and happier life.No doubt Ken Takakura is impeccable. I am so glad that director ZhangYiMou who I used to know is back. His previous two hollow movies (YingXiong and ShiMianMaiFu) were really big disappointment. Hope director ChenKaiGe can follow Zhang's step and bring us a movie like BaWangBieJi not WuJi.A very touching drama. 9/10"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"I never fail to be enchanted by Yimou Zhang's films. Curse of the Golden Flower, hero, House of Flying Daggers - they are all superb and pleasurable on so many levels. I can just imagine what we be be seeing at the opening and closing of the Olympics next year.This film, while not on the scale of the others, is no less powerful and pleasurable.Ken Takakura (Black Rain, Mr. Baseball, The Yakuza) doesn't give us one of those performances that earned him the name ""The Japanese Clint Eastwood."" It is a tender and touching performance that shows his deep acting skills. One might compare it to Eastwood's performance in Unforgiven.He travels to China to get closer to his son, to whom he is estranged, and finds himself in the process. Xiaoding Zhao's cinematography that so trilled us in House of Flying Daggers is no less impressive here. The beauty of China is there for all to enjoy.This sound by Jing Tao is equally impressive, as it was in the movies mentioned above. Jingzhi Zou's screenplay will bring you to tears and make you assess your own relationships and maybe get them straight before it is too late.While there were many excellent performance, and Takakura's was outstanding, I would be remiss not mentioning Lin Qiu, who was really good in his first film as a translator who spoke little Japanese.Another outstanding film by Zhang and Takakura."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"In this film, Zhang Yimou portrays the stark difference between Japanese and Chinese culture without succumbing to biased tendencies. Among the numerous cultural differences, perhaps the greatest visual distinction would be the colorful masses of China against the gray, solitude of Japan. The audience becomes aware of these contrasts as Takata, a Japanese father sets out on a journey to China in hopes of improving his estranged relationship with his son who is dying from liver cancer. Through his travels Takata comes to a greater understanding about life, himself, and his son's interest with the Chinese culture, especially the folk operas."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"From HERO to HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERAS, the reputation of director Zhang YiMo has been persistently and severely bombarded with a fusillade of invectives at home and abroad, all the critics are pointing fingers at Zhang's pedantic and unsuccessful insistence in combining both the commercial elements and artistry ,evetually director Zhang awakens to the realization that only serene yet powerful drama rather than a kind of courteous kitsch like KongFu movies is commensurate with his talents and can restore his dying fame. QIAN LI ZOU DAN QI ( the lonely emissary in a thousand mile would be its literal translation) is the typical embodiment of all director Zhang's inimitable cinematographic skills and the stark views of Li river. the whole movie is inexhaustible in symbolism and director Zhang develops a predilection for slowness ,just like his other movies, for example, KEEP COOL, NOT ONE LESS,JUDOU... etc. The story is based upon a true one about a Japanese father taking care of his moribund son, who was bent on studying opera,intends to fulfill his son's last dream that is to learn opera. In the course of their rigorous quest, they meet a Chinese girl who later is chased after by hoodlums, the bizarre trio bond together and escape the prosecution from both countries. QIAN LI ZOU DAN QI is the quintessence of underdogs thrown into turmoils,transcending adversity and reaping happiness ever after, such genre is director Zhang's forte. Dating back to the last century, the partnership of Zhang and Gong Li gave birth to a legion of typical ZhangGong-esquire movies such as RAISE THE RED LANTERN which is my personal favorite, THE STORY OF QIU JU, TO LIVE,etc.. Thus this one doesn't stray away from the path . You can still feel Zhang's aggression towards inequality, officialdom, unnecessary suspicion amongst people,vividly. ONLY this time it's somehow misplaced.the screen-scripts of QIAN has been in gestation for five years and during the period Zhang has produced blockbusters like HERO and THE HOSUE OF FLYING DAGGERS. This time instead of casting renowned Asian actors repeating hoary tricks, QIAN casted little known actors to shoulder the responsibility of displaying grace under pressure. Ken Takakura playing Takada, fisherman, did an awesome job, he amazingly used his facial expressions and silent body gestures to reflect his pains, most time he is reticent about his past and don't resort to old-fashioned misty-eyedness or implausible frowns like many Asian actors still practice. Due to his taciturnity, he makes his portrayal of the sorrow-stricken father impressive. Kiichi Nakai playing Kenichi, Takada's ailing son , is no less wonderful and his performance and the effect of makeup synergistically convince people he is being seriously traumatized. In the meantime,Zhang conveys the alienation inside the relationship - and the alienation outside - (I am referring to the fact that they are in a different country) through colors and camera-movements. We are constantly looking at the protagonists from a corner high above or through the window of a teeming street. Every single shot feels claustrophobic and it irritates the viewer. It makes the viewer long for closeness and clarity. It imitates the longing of the characters and their attempts - and failure - at connecting to each other. Their feelings, as does the eye of the lens, float above them in a silent, detached loneliness. Having said that, this movie isn't immaculate , director Zhang is not in his prime, so i consider it's unfair to juxtapose his recent works with his heyday success, QIAN still lacks originality and the whole plot remains nebulous as always. Zhang wants to depict darkness in the society while through intentionally using a wholesale of bright and roseate colors. Such contrast can be found in his former works,but highly unlikely his former glory, the theme of this movie is no longer appropriate for the spaghetti effect,you will not be surprised to taste bitterness and vacuity in his movie.It's not a entertainment enjoyment for everyone, i would recommend it to people with a penchant for symbolism and a propensity to dig pungent individualism. 8/10"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Zhang Yimou's last two martial arts films had much to commend them, but, honestly, I'd trade ten such films for this. It was almost too much to hope for that the director would return to his earlier, humanist style of film-making that saw ""The Road Home,"" ""Not One Less"" and ""Happy Times"" - but he has, and wonderfully so. Ken Takakura, who has appeared in fine films such as ""Poppoya"" and ""The Yellow Handkerchief,"" really shines here. It's his film all the way, and a wonderful tribute that Zhang chose to craft this film for him.While the core of the film lies with the emotions of the characters, I should also point out that the cinematography here is splendid - there are shots that are as breathtaking as anything in ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."""
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Not many movies have been made on the subject of internal journey into a father's heart. The movie hence felt very original all through.The protagonist is a very mature aged person, and he makes many mature and insightful choices through the movie. Choices that nudge you in the right direction.Exemplary acting from the main protagonist. Amazing acting from the rest of the crew as well.It is a good travalogue, lot of rustic sights, grand genuine scenery.Great movie. Insightful ride for the heart.Director's mastery is undeniable"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"To be brutally honest, I have to confess that I spent a good part of this movie struggling not to succumb to the temptation to fall asleep. Director Yimou Zhang makes a deliberate attempt to tug on the viewers' heart strings with ""Riding Alone"" but aside from a handful of scenes near the end of the movie (particularly those that portrayed the relationship between Takata and Yang Yang) I can't say that I found myself especially moved. The story is about a Japanese man (Takata) whose son (Rie) is gravely ill in a Tokyo hospital. The two have been estranged for years and when Takata visits Rie in the hospital, Rie refuses to see him. Takata, however, takes home a video given to him by Rie's wife, which gives Takata a greater understanding of his son's dreams, and compels him to travel to Yunnan Province in China to fulfil one of those dreams. For whatever reason, this movie just didn't make a connection with me. The scenes set inside the Chinese prison particularly struck me as being very unlikely. I have difficulty believing that conditions in that environment would be so welcoming to a foreigner and so apparently comfortable for the inmates.The last half hour or so wasn't bad but I have to say that I had a lot of difficulty making it that far. 2/10"
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Far removed from his politically and socially conscious films of the 90s that reflected the institutionalized oppression in early twentieth-century China, Zhang Yimou's latest efforts have ranged from martial-arts films that come to terms with the status quo to bland character studies of village life. Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles, an unconvincing drama about the emotional fallout from the lack of communication between a taciturn father and his seriously ill son, continues in the same lightweight vein. Although it is a well-crafted film, the best thing it has going for it is the wonderful performance of 70-year old veteran Yazuka actor Ken Takakura whose emotionless persona makes Clint Eastwood look like Robin Williams.The story involves the estrangement (never explained) between Gou-ichi Takata and his son Ken-ichi (Kiichi Nakai) who is dying of Liver Cancer in a Tokyo hospital. After traveling from his fishing village to the hospital and being turned away by his son, Takata resolves to make a final gesture of reconciliation. He watches videotape given to him by his daughter Rie (Shinobu Teraima) that was filmed in the Chinese province of Yunnan where Kenichi had been gathering material for a research project on Chinese folk opera. Takata decides to travel to China to fulfill his son's thwarted goal - to film the opera singer Li Jiamin (Li Jiamin) singing a selection from the folk opera Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles.Battling a language barrier, Takata's trip to China is Lost in Translation redux, only with some unlikely characters showing the happy face of Communism. These include a prison warden with a soft heart toward his prisoners, robust, happy villagers in a remote area of rural China, and a bright, uninhibited eight-year old who is constantly tugging at our heartstrings. Takata, assisted by earnest interpreters Jasmine (Jiang Wen) and Lingo (Lin Qui), learns that the singer Li Jiamin is serving a prison term of three years and an appeal for filming in the prison means getting permission from high level ministers in the Chinese bureaucracy. Unlike the experiences of Qui Ji in an earlier Zhang film, however, the experience is not overly daunting for Takata who is singularly resolved to accomplish his goal.After viewing a filmed message from Takata pleading for permission to film Li performing a song from the opera in prison, the Bureau Chief is moved and grants him permission. Unfortunately, when the filming is set, Li has too many unresolved emotional issues concerning his own son to allow him to continue and Takata resolves to find Yang Yang, Li's son, and bring him to his father in order to allow him to complete the filming. Ultimately the journey of Takata for his son turns out to be one of discovery for himself and, as he must rely on the good will and support of the people around him to achieve his purpose, he discovers his own ability to give and receive love.Riding Alone has a good message - that open and honest communication in a family is more important than being right but the message is undercut by a surfeit of schmaltz and plot contrivances and Yimou again fails to reach the magic of the earlier years."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Having seen most of Zhang Yimou's films and feeling very disappointed with several of his last, i.e., Hero, House of the Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flowers, I found this one to be very delightful. The presence of Ken Takakura, sometimes called the Japanese ""Clint Eastwood,"" added much to this viewing pleasure. One of the great things about Zhang has always been to capture the essence of his characters against a visually stimulating background. Even those films which I've not found pleasing are visual packages of sweeping landscapes, lush scenes with riots of color and memorable images. My whine has been the lack of substance in the stories of these epics which are too often laced with fantastic stereotypes which get boring after a short while. However, this film based on the premise of a father's attempt to reconcile with his dying son by traveling to China to film a folk opera and wherein he succeeds in coming to grips with his own issues, works in large part because of Takakura's stoic performance and the wonderful portrayal of the honesty of local people by Zhang. I throughly disagree with the facing reviewer who found the storyline superficial. It works. And, although Zhang Yimou may no longer be the ""angry young man"" rebelling against the Chinese bureaucracy, he does succeed in showing that there are still people, simple people who can rail against an incompetent interpreter and swallow their bureaucratic officiousness to help a fellow man."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"A stony, serious man Takata has spent the last ten years of his life living and working in a small coastal town as a fisherman. Seemingly content, he lives a solitary life. However, Takata's quiet life is given a shock when his daughter-in-law calls him and informs him that his son is sick and in the hospital. Takata rushes to Tokyo to see his son whom he has not spoken to for over ten years after a falling out between the two. When he arrives at the hospital, Rie, his daughter-in-law, informs him that his son does not know that he was coming and his son who refuses to see him soon turns him away. Distraught, Rie gives Takata a video of traditional Chinese dancing that Kenichi filmed in Yunnan.After he has returned home, Takata watches the video and learns of his son's, an arts professor at the University of Tokyo, love of Chinese Dancing. In the video Kenichi interviews a man named Li who is able to perform a difficult piece called ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"", but because he is sick he is unable to perform the piece that day, so he invites Kenichi to come watch him perform the piece the following year.A short time later, Rie calls Takata and informs him that Kenichi has stomach cancer and that the disease is terminal. In order to become closer to his son Takata travels to China to film Li performing ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles,"" but he soon learns that Li is imprisoned for stabbing a man. His translator Jasmine wants him to return home, but Takata is determined to film the piece. With the aid of Lingo, a nice fellow who speaks to Takata in a mixture of broken English and Chinese, Takata through some extreme measures is finally able to see Li perform, but Li is unable to perform because he wants to see his young son whose existence he has only known of for a short time. Although Jasmine and Lingo want him to go home and although Rie wants him to return as well, Takata is determined to fetch Li's son Yang Yang and bring him to Li in order for him to be able to film the performance. However, Takata, in the end, is able to gain much more than what he originally set out for.Famous for his portrayals of gangsters and cowboys, the deadpan Takakura Ken strikes an opposing figure even at the age of seventy-four, stone silent throughout most of the film, most of Takakura's words are through internal dialogue through which he enlightens the audience on such topics as his own difficulties expressing emotion and the ways in which he is moved by the kindness of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's willingness to express emotion which is very unlike the Japanese. Takakura's character in fact has so much trouble expressing his emotions that he has to talk through a video camera to an official in order to get his feelings across. Takakura's glacially cool performance is truly able to move audience when cracks appear in his hard exterior. Moments such as when he smiles at Yang Yang or when his tears flow in the video truly tug at the heartstrings.While Riding Along for Thousands of Miles might not be a hard hitting social commentary in the same vein as To Live, Not One Less, or the Story of Qiu Ju, it is still quite a good film especially for the fact that Zhang centers the film around Japanese characters in a time in which relations with Japan are at their worst in quite a number of years."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"I believe the director's purpose was to show how estranged cultures, like estranged family relationships, can learn to transcend their isolated differences through compassion and hard work and in turn build bridges of trust, unity and friendship. The theme of reconciliation is pervasive throughout the film and is predominantly layered through culture and more specifically, family. Director Zhang Yimou illustrates this theme in three specific ways.The first general evidence of transcendence from estrangement comes through father Takata's struggles to win back the trust and respect from his son who he hasn't seen in over ten years. By embarking on a difficult journey to make this reconciliation efficacious, Takata secretly travels to China, unbeknownst to his hospital-ridden son, to film a well-celebrated masked opera that his son deeply admires. Takata's journey is not easy. In fact, the difficulties he encounters (i.e. receiving permission from law enforcement agencies to film prisoner/actor Li Jiamin, finding the prisoners son, Yang Yang) require hard work and compassion. The determination Takata has in creating this film for his son, despite the conflicts that seek to thwart his efforts, demonstrates his fortitude in proving to his son that he loves him and wants to make restitution. The mere fact that he wants this film to be made in secrecy and not publicly announced to his son heightens the sense of compassion he has for him.The second more specific evidence of transcendence from estrangement is during Yang Yang's departure into the mountain wilderness and Takata's search after him. In a very literal way, both are estranged from different cultures and do not understand one another. This is a figurative parallel of Takata's estrangement from his own son; both having not communicated in over ten years and do not understand where the other is coming from. In this regard, Takata and his son really do come from two different spiritual cultures. Takata narrates that his search to find Yang Yang in the wilderness is a representation, or parallel, of his own search in figuring out how to reunite with his son back in Japan. Upon finding Yang Yang after some difficulty and hard work, he runs away. This is comparable to Takata's own son running away, or rather rejecting his visit at the hospital. There is a beautiful bonding moment captured between Takata and Yang Yang after they become lost. They both share ways in signaling the search parties to rescue themTakata flashes the light from his camera up in the air while Yang Yang blows a fishing whistle given to him by Takata. After they are found the next day, something special has taken place between them both. They embrace in a very touching moment, having somehow built throughout the difficult experience a relationship of trust and unity. They both act as surrogates to one anotherYang Yang acting as the son Takata never had, and Takata acting as the father Yang Yang never knew. This scene is very significant in creating a hope inside of Takata, as well as the viewer, that perhaps the reunion with his own son will be similar.The third specific evidence of transcendence from estrangement is the director's choice of color in illustrating both Chinese and Japanese cultures. The colors in Japan are very subdued, cold and harsha reflection of the inward character of Takata; a man who admits he has a very difficult time expressing his emotions, let alone dealing with people, and, who, like his son, feels more comfortable hiding behind a mask than revealing his true nature. The dark colors of Japan are also perhaps symbolic of the director's feelings of isolation from other nations and his desire to transcend them. As soon as Takata journey's into China, the colors become warm, alive and vibranta reflection of the inward desire that Takata wants to be but doesn't know how to go about doing so. Perhaps the warm colors of China also reflect the director's own desire in welcoming a foreign nation with loving hands. It's interesting to note that the warmth of this embrace isn't coming from his own nation, but from anotherthus exalting the position of another before his own. This idea of guanxi is typical in most Eastern culturesthat is, gift giving that lubricates social relationships. In this case, the gift that Yimou is giving to increase his countries social standing is of exalting another country, namely China, by painting them in majestic colors."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"One of the first Yimou flics I saw was Raise the Red Lantern and it's visuals hooked me on Yimou's style and storytelling. Continuing in that tradition, we've got a slightly formulaic film here (at least I think so) about a father living in a very remote fishing village who's estranged from his son after the death of his wife. I'm glad Yimou chose Takakura (in the role of Takata) to play the ""brooding, silent type"" character because over the course of Takakura's career he's fit into those types of roles like an old familiar coat. Here we see he's rather out of sorts, doing his fishing gig, and not quite sure how to respond to his daughter-in-law Rie's call stating that his son is in the hospital. It does trigger his conscience and gnaws at his regrets. Eager to find some resolution with his son, Takata comes to the hospital but his visit is rejected by his still angry son. Shortly after this, Rie gives him a tape that his son has been working on to help Takata to get to know his son better. What ensues after that is quite a journey into the human self and the paths taken towards reconciliation with the past. Western movie fans might pass right over the reversal in the storyline between the events that cause Takata, Jiamin Li, and Yang Yang's paths to cross if they're not paying attention. Again, a bit formulaic but typical of themes in many Asian films. The visuals are great and subtle screen emotions do pour out at pivotal points in the movie. I loved it. If you find yourself saying ""take the kid with you"", you missed the whole point of the reversal and of this movie. Sometimes the guy does not kiss the girl in the end and sometimes not everyone lives happily ever after. The meaning is much deeper."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Zhang Yimou is well-known for being the best director in the history of Chinese film. He is among the best directors in history of all film. His work in Traveling Alone shows his tremendous range and ability to retain great emotional depths regardless of the scope of his productions.This film about a man from a fishing village who is estranged from his son and then tries to reconcile with him is extremely emotional. His trip to Japan and the mountains of Yunnan to complete the wishes of his dying son are profound. However, I did suffer one short moment of irreverence when I was watching the touching dance scene in the prison. I could not help but think of The Producers, and the prison play ""Prisoners of Love"". I apologize for the momentary lapse in good taste. All the actors do an exceptional job, as does the young boy who is the son of the prison singer, but . the real stars here are the writer and director, who bring this story to the screen."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Viewed on DVD. Subtitles/translations =ten (10) stars; production values = nine (9) stars; Action Director Yimou Zhang takes his hand off the throttle to deliver a change of pace drama with essentially two stars: a small Chinese boy and the spectacular scenery of (then) remote Southwestern China. He conjures up an interesting tale, but it is far from an audience magnet. The photo play probably looked better in Preproduction (script, storyboards, casting, etc.) than it does on screen. This may be due to prosaic, by-the-book editing; but it seems mostly the result of lethargic acting by professional actors/actresses (the rural-area non pros out perform the pros in the majority of scenes). Nicely captured and delineated by the Director are the different levels of behavior from business dictates to cultural conditioning to the real feelings of Japanese and Chinese as individuals (perhaps you have encountered these dichotomies in your travels). Cinematography (wide screen, color) and scene lighting are excellent. So is set design. Score is fine, but the surround sound field is not there yet. Subtitles/translations are a pure pleasure to behold. Not only are near simultaneous line readings in Japanese and Mandarin translated well, but the name of every film contributor listed in the opening and closing credits is translated into English from Japanese or Mandarin (even those with English-lettered names are translated into Mandarin!). Rarely (make that just about never for Japanese films) is credit given where it is due in movie translations. Well worth watching. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD."

This is not the case as is made clear in this movie.If you are concerned about the subtitles, let me tell you that they were not hard to read and did not in any way distract from the enjoyment of the movie.

Zhang Yimou has carefully crafted a stunning film portraying the differences between the Japanese and the Chinese culture.

If I had to choose a film to show an alien what it is to be human I might well choose this. The director and cast illustrate how our emotional health is linked with other, even strangers. How we are broken by hiding feelings & how we break loved ones in the process. How a sign of care from even a cultural alien can reach in and defrost a frozen soul."

千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Yimou Zhang can be best remembered for his critically acclaimed and visually poignant films like ""Hero"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower,"" but once he stepped into the realm of drama, he went with no doubt into great new territories. ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" is more of a personal film for Zhang about a father seeking the forgiveness of his dying son. Beginning in Japan, Tataka, an elderly father, comes to visit the bedside of his dying son who has estranged him for quite some time. It is vaguely believed that the son has withheld speaking to him for years, and in part to Tataka leaving his wife. What he discovers is a deathly ill son, (who is never shown) forbidding himself to see his father before death. But in order to regain his son back, Tataka goes on an extraordinary journey to film the last portion of a video he never got to film, the dance sequence from the Chinese folk dance, ""Riding alone for thousands of miles."" Tataka's journey sends him into a foreign culture, still in the aisle of his well known Asia, into the heart of China where he hires an interpreter to exchange words with some of the people he meets. Although a language barrier exists, those who come to meet him in China, know his sorry and regret for his son, and can't help but to feel compassion for a man who tries to accomplish the mission of fulfilling his son's final wish. What gives Zhang a great kick is to see how he manages to direct a cast of unknowns and unprofessional actors. This is the kind of film that manages to take you into one direction, and spin you into a complete different ending where the realization comes that the journey wasn't to find what was originally intended. It has the doppelganger effect in that it focuses on the quest for one thing, and expels you into a self-discovery about the precious meaning of life and the worth to take better care of it, in a life of forgiveness and ultimate redemption."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles is a lovely tale about a father who, knowing nothing about his son's adult life-aside form the fact that he is dying-decides to finish what he thinks his son has started with the utmost care and desire to complete. The film speaks about what people will do to regain the love they lost and how the journey is almost more precious than the destination.Mr. Takata leaves his life in Japan to see his estranged son who is has liver cancer and is dying. when he arrives at the hospital, he is coldly rebuffed bye his son. His daughter in law, Rie, gives him a tape that his son, Ken-ichi, made. With the tape he discovers that his son has a passion for Chinese folk opera and impulsively resolves to travel to china to film ''riding alone for thousands of miles'' for his son. It is interesting that Yimou never shows Ken-ichi, and it is necessary to give the audience the same feeling of longing that Mr. Takata feels, the same feeling of distance and separation. Also, refraining from free-flowing emotions evokes the strict composure of Japanese culture.Upon traveling to china to finish the video, Ken-ichi's father discovers that he is not the only man who has an imperfect relationship with his son. His journey takes him outside of his shell and into another world. After his wife died, he escaped by disappearing from his son's life and what he knew to be his own. By connecting another father and son he, in a way, heals himself.Much like life, the film is funny and endearing, although gloomy and depressing at times. I liked watching this movie because I felt relaxed and drawn into the story. The scenes where Mr. Takata is staring out into the ocean especially calm me. The rhythm of those scenes coupled with the sound of the beach gave me a the feeling of being there. I like the that the title is the title of the play that Mr. Takata journeys to capture. The plot of the play reflects his own situation because he also travels alone for thousands of miles to help someone (really himself more than his son). I recommend this film to those who enjoy subtlety in story-telling."

Yimou Zhang's cinematographer vision truly brought this movie into a new level. A large variety of close-ups really revealed the true character's personality. The most intriguing technical feature of the film were the sound effects. The soundtrack was very subtle and really allowed a movie watcher to sink deep within the story. Especially during the father's (Takata) close-ups. The sound effects such as: wind, ocean, birds and etc. really allowed one to experience the inside of the soul. The soundtrack symbolized how empty and and also how full one's soul can be. This film is a true masterpiece of Yimou Zhang."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"With ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles,"" Zhang Yimou proves how much you can take out of a simple story. I found myself emotionally involved and suffered with Takata (the main character) on his long and sometimes lonely journey.This intimate character drama is about a Japanese dad (Takata) who travels to China to reconnect with his dying son. When Takata realizes that his son has not forgiven him for mistakes he made in the past, he decides to finish a documentary that his son worked on but wasn't able to finish.On his journey to China, we experience along with Takata, how cultures and people can clash but also learn from each other. And, sometimes our dreams and goals can change without a warning.This is not a martial arts film but its shots and cinematography are just as beautiful as we are used to from his past films such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"I found this film simply beautiful and was enthralled by the subtly complex, quiet, and emotional performance of Ken Takakura as Takata. I had never heard of this actor before and was pleasantly surprised by him. I can understand why he is compared to Clint Eastwood, because both actors have a tough guy exterior, which contains hidden depths. His plight to film a Chinese folk opera for his dying, and eventually deceased son, was unwavering as was the way he went about it. He dove, wholeheartedly into this task, and it wasn't until about mid-way through the film, when he discovers that his son has died that his goal takes on a whole new dimension. Along the way, through a sheer stoke of fate, he meets and befriends the young boy (who was also great) and he becomes the son who he can actually help, unlike his real son who he can no longer do anything for. His semi simple task of traveling from his native Japan to China, with the help of two well meaning translators, takes on a much more elaborate dimension, as he feels a new sense of responsibility to the new people who have come into his life. Also, the seaside fishing village where Takata had made a home for himself, ostrasizing himself from his son in the first place was representative of Japanese culture itself. There were two scenes in the film where Takata is standing at the foot of a grey, violent, harshly beautiful sea lost in his own thoughts, and it isn't until he ventures to China where he is awashed in vibrant oranges and reds, signifying the end of his emotional isolation and his return to being connected to his fellow man."

It makes you laugh with cute jokes and jabs, and it makes you cry with heart breaking realities. Ken Takakura says little in the movie, but you can tell every thought that goes through his mind as he goes along his journey of atonement for his son. The simple task that he goes to perform turns into a long drawn out journey that eventually leads to him finding peace with his past wrongdoings and learning more about his son's life, which had formally been a distant, almost nonexistent relationship. We see the determination and patience that this man goes through to achieve his goal, even when it is apparent that his task is near impossible and inconvenient to achieve. Yimou Zhang fills the screen with the beautiful landscapes of China and uses everything in the scene to his advantage. The casting of the villagers and the little boy was done perfectly as well. I found myself falling in love with the little boy, even through his stubbornness and young determination. This movie is a great experience to enjoy for everyone and will make you redefine your close relationships and will make you want to equate your life accordingly."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"I never paid much attention to who directs the movie, so I was surprised that the director who made the movies ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" is the same director that made ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" Yimou Zhang did an excellent job making this film. He was able to show the audience Takata's struggles of being a foreigner and the frustration of not speaking China's native tongue. I think the film relates to everyone, Fathers and sons, Mothers and daughters. The film shows the relationship between family that became strangers and so often in life, tragedy usually what makes them come together. Takata's son became ill and was diagnose with cancer. I think Takata traveling to China to film Li singing was to get closure with his son. Even though the film shows that the son appreciated Takata's gesture, you kind of question if that is true, maybe the daughter in law was lying to him, in order for him to come home and see his son for the last time. I also think that the letter written by the son could also be a lie from the daughter in law and she was the one that wrote it. It's possible that she, herself was giving closure to both Father and son by telling Takata that his son forgave him and that he loves him. It was also the same when Takata didn't tell Li that his son died and that he doesn't have to sing the opera song. Some things are meant not to be said and lying is sometimes necessary.-- I truly enjoy this film, I think capturing true emotions on film is more difficult than making martial arts and Zhang was able to accomplish this in ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"""
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles is a very touching movie that depicts the journey of a man in the pursuit of forgiveness and redemption from past actions. The main character is the father of a dying son with whom he had had a distant paternal relationship. Takata, the father gets a phone call that breaks right into the loneliness bubble he had put himself into after his wife passed away. His life changes drastically when he realizes he is about to lose his own son for whom he had done so little in life.An important role is played by Takata's daughter in law, who calls him and requests his presence for his son is about to die. The son had some major resentment about his absence after the death of his mom and does not want to see him. Now all Takata has is a tape with his son's documentary about Chinese folk operas. In it, he expresses his will to return the next year and film it again, which is the key for Takata to a whole new world of self acknowledgment in his journey to earn his son's forgiveness. On this trip to China Takata faces the biggest barrier to his objective, the gateway to his true feelings. The theme of the masks in the movie also refers to the masks used in the characters daily lives where the most beautiful or painful feelings have to be hidden behind appearances. The difference between the Chinese and the Japanese environments is another remarkable element. Director Yimoy manipulated these differences very well to express the coldness of the masquerade feelings as opposed to the colorful open-heartedness of letting one's feelings out. Takata's main objective turns into something bigger and even nobler as the story develops. Without speaking a word in Chinese, he gets people to help him try and shoot the same Chinese folk opera singer his son had filmed, whom was in jail. As he comes to understand that filming in jail is not something easy/likely to happen he faces the need to share his own story with random people for them to understand his noble intentions and help him out. He keeps his humility around the only people who can help him get forgiveness from his son. The more help he gets, the more he knows about himself and about his son, something he had never looked into ever before. In his journey Takata learns more about the imprisoned singer and how he had never seen his own son. Takata thinks about how he wishes he had a closer relationship with his own son and tries to bring Yang Yang to meet his dad in jail. As it turns out that the boy does not have anyone to play the whole of a real parent in his life, Takata faces an opportunity to bond in a paternal relationship with him. That does not last long but it became a life lesson for this man who finally proved to himself that he can be a loving person and does not need to hide his feelings behind a mask.The filming became less important as he started bonding with human beings that were nice and helped him for no reason. The whole effort he put into trying to get forgiveness from is son is what made his actions noble and even though he did not get back in time to see his son, he got a forgiving letter that meant the complete release of the guiltiness he had carried in his heart for a long time."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Riding Alone For Thousands of Miles is an excellent film that truly depicts the differences in the Chinese and Japanese cultures (not in a negative tone, just different). Yimou Zhang's film creates a sense of isolationism when we see Japan. By and large, it feels like Japan has lost touch of its culture by keeping up with today's technology/modernization. In Japan, the audience never sees more than one person in a shot, with respect to Mr. Takata and his daughter-in-law. The colors that the audience sees in Japan reflect Takata's emotional demeanor, blue and gray. Although the fishing village that Mr. Takata moves to after his wife died was very tranquil, it creates a very somber tone and adds to the feeling of absolute solitude.On the other hand, Zhang depicts China as a group-oriented culture that remains connected to its ancient roots and traditions. China feels more warm and accepting than Japan due to its vibrant colors that are used to express the rich heritage of the operas.The opera, ""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles,"" proves to be both a critical and also meaningless component of the movie. While filming the opera becomes the goal of Mr. Takata to re-connect with his son, it is not the opera that connects them; the heartfelt expression to travel to China is what Takata's son responds to. However, the question still remains as to whether or not Mr. Takata's son actually said anything or if it was just a ploy to get Mr. Takata to come home.Zhang Yimou does a great job of bringing Mr. Takata's emotions to a forefront. It was especially moving when Mr. Takata had to film a tape of himself asking for permission to go into the prison to tape the opera. It makes the audience wonder whether or not Takata would've been able to express his emotions if he wasn't twice removed by the TV screen and through the translation.All in all, I commend Zhang Yimou for a creating a movie that provokes the audience to think outside of the box."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"I like how this movie compares two cultures that historically hated each other. Remaining unbiased to the justness of each, Zhang explores a variety of contrasting aspects between the Chinese and Japanese cultural norms. He leaves us with an insightful appreciation of both. On one side we have the Chinese valuation of family and community; on the other side we witness the Japanese regard for independence. We are shown both Japanese strength of composure and Chinese openness to expression.Takakura does an amazing job of acting like he's not acting. By this I mean Mr. Takata's battle with the suppression of his emotional expression. Takakura's challenge was to obviously exist in anguish while showing signs to no one. Throughout the movie you can see the torment in his eyes while he struggles to shroud it from his hosts. Needless to say he can't always hide it (otherwise Takakura would of had it a little easier) and the times that he slips up and makes the sad face are the times that reassure us of his humanity. In fact, many times it takes just that to remind ourselves of the very same thing."

What is curious, yet touching about this film is how the father's journey for his son, turns into a journey for himself. At the beginning the father, Takata states that he is bad with people, yet if he wishes to finish the film for his son, he must interact with many different people who are not only of a different culture, but who do not speak the same language.Takata sees himself and his own son in the imprisoned opera singer, it is because of this that he tries to bring Yang Yang to see his father. Also, upon seeing how Yang Yang has no father figure in his life, Takata soon builds a close relationship with him, much like a father son relationship. This relationship shows Takata that he is very capable of emotions, and no longer needs to lock away his feelings."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" is a touching story about a man's quest for redemption and to repair the relationship with his son. This is also a story about a foreigner in a strange country and the isolation one can feel by not speaking the language, even when you are surrounded by people. Even though the father and son are never able to see each other before the son dies, the gesture the father makes by going on his journey leads to a much deeper connection between the father and son than they would have achieved through small talk in a hospital room. Redemption is achieved not only through his son's letter, but also, showing the pictures of Yang Yang to his imprisoned father, indirectly reconnecting them together."

千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles is a film that illustrates the agony that a father experiences when he tries to reunite with his dying son. Ken Takakura, who played the father, is an emotionally reserved Japanese man who, in order to express his love for his dying son, travels to China from Japan to film a song and dance performance by Li Jianima, an ancient musical artist. Yahoo Zhang, the director,conveys the will and dedication of the father as he travels a long distance to carry out his son's dying wish of capturing Li Jianima on tape. The father has difficulty capturing this artist on tape when he receives news that Li Jianima is in prison. The father wins the audience over with his profound acting that illustrates the devotion and commitment he possesses for his son. Through the use of color, Zhang captures the essence of the two contrasting cultures, Japan and China. Zhang uses soft blue and steel colors to show the sophisticated and modern culture of Japan. In contrast, Zhang provides the audience with bright vivid red and yellow colors to express the liveliness and traditional behaviors of the Chinese culture."

I admired the lead actor mister Takakura Ken and also i was amazed with all the other actors. A lot of them were amateurs.Also i liked this province of China, Yunan.I found that China has the most bizarre and amazing landmarks. Congratulations to the sensitive director Zwang Yimou.Iwill try to see all his films.The problem is that maybe i can't find all the films in my country. Anyhow,Zwang Yimou is one of the men that i would like to meet and have a discussion with.I also was amazed with Chinese Opera,I find that it is something very difficult.But also Chinese people is, in my opinion, one of the most amazing people of the earth.I find that the new Chinese cinema is excellent, like the film again of Zwang Yimou, Returning home."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"'Riding Alone for a Thousand Miles' is work of wonderful art. Not only does it have a heart felt story the cinematography is quite compelling.It is about a estranged relationship between a father, Gouichi Takada, and son, Kiichi. They have not communicated for years-until things become life or death. The daughter in law calls Takada and tells him that his son has terminal cancer. Kiichi still does not want to see his father, so Takada goes on a mission to China. He tries to do a kind gesture of recording a folk song for his dying son, only to encounter numerous obstacles of language, time, and governmental red tape.The content of the story is as strong as the style. The effect of the film is a mark of a master of style and technique. Take into consideration the contrast in the shots between China compared to that of Japan. Somewhat of a subtle change, yet one that the viewer can feel.For instance, in the beginning of the movie there is visually stunning scene. Takada is sitting on a remote cold beach. There is a grey sky and streams of dusty light pierce the dark clouds. The dark navy ocean breaks against the black, charcoal rocks. Later when we see him shovel snow, the only grass is the dead dull yellows patches here and there in the frame. The images look flat and blurry. Perhaps shot with a long lens.Another example of this is when the daughter-in-law is on the phone with Takada. She learns that he in China and she wants him to come back to Japan. She blends in to her environment which lacks color. Or when she stands on the balcony, she is in a grey dress and dark jacket. The sky is overcast and the trees are a grey brown. The palette is of limited colors that range from muted grey to dull blues.On the hand, scenes in China are colorful and much more lively. For example, when Lingo takes Takada to buy a silk banner. There are robust images of brilliant reds and striking yellows. The sky in China is a shade of jade blue with white fluffy clouds. Not at all like the sky that is shown in Japan.Furthermore, when Lingo and Takada are on their way to Stone Village, they are picked up by an old truck. They are standing along side women who have colorful scarves of pink, green, orange and red. There is also green leaves and branches that are in baskets tied to the truck. This vibrant color was not seen in the shots of Japan either. Seems like scenes in China have deep focus too.There is a contrast between Japan and China. Yet, they are quite subtle and do not pull us out of the story. They just seem to feel different. This detail, again is the work of a director who really knows their craft."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Too much emotions and pain in a single person, a story that gives a lesson of life. Takata is extremely herd by his wife's death that he plunges into loneliness and no-contact with his son Kenichi who is dying of cancer at a hospital, refusing to see his father. A journey that helps Takata rediscover the value of family through the grace of Yang Yang, a kid whose father is imprisoned for an ironic act of defense. The movie is all about self analysis and forgiveness; Takata stops been emotionless after he was told about Kenichi's death, but specially after having experienced the cultural values of a foreign country. The narrative is the only fact I felt a bit ambiguous; however, the real language that must be spoken in this film is the language of feelings and expressions."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles, directed by Yimou Zhang and co-directed with Yasuo Furuhata, left me feeling a little sad and at the same time inspired by the fathers persistence.It was very interesting to see the similarities and differences of the Japanese and Chinese cultures side by side as the story intertwined the two. I, myself being married into a first generation Chinese family here in America; I found it fascinating how the Chinese culture was depicted as being more open, warm and caring for the foreigner. I did not always find it easy to communicate with my father-in-law, not due to the language barrier, but more because females typically do not join the conversations.The emotional struggles that Takata, the father, overcomes to bring himself to visit his ailing son in the hospital, is a turmoil none of us should have to go through, but because of this thing called pride, it happens time and time again. Pride often has us wait until it is almost too late or is too late to make amends with a family member or friend. Takata realizes this and in his quest to fulfill his son's wishes, tries to reunite another father and son, so they do not go down the same path he is traveling.It is a very touching story that I would highly recommend to those who want to see family values through the eyes of another culture. It makes you reflect on your own conduct towards family and friends and to determine for yourself if amends need to be made."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"""Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles"" is about a Japanese man, Takata, who travels to China to film a masked folk opera for his estranged son, who is dying of cancer. Father and child have grown extremely distant since the death of Takata's wife when the son was younger. Takata has closed himself off from the world, including his own son, and isolates himself to a small fishing village. Takata travels to Tokyo to visit his son in the hospital, at the insistence of his daughter in law, but his son refuses to see him. After learning of his son's love for Chinese folk operas and fatal diagnosis, Takata takes it upon himself to travel to China to film a particular opera singer performing a particular opera for his son--an opera and singer the son intended to return and see the following year.Of course, things are not that simple. The opera singer is in jail and the Chinese government isn't too keen on foreigners filming inside of their prisons. First Takata is stuck in a bureaucratic mess, then he has to go looking for the singer's illegitimate son in a remote village so that he will sing, all while his daughter and law keeps pressing him to return and see his son before he dies. The plot, while somewhat interesting, is rather predictable, especially at the end. But this is hardly some plot driven thriller or fantastical martial arts movie. This is a film about communication and alienation.First, the simple language and cultural barriers are a struggle for Takata. Westerners tend to group Asian cultures together as on giant, cohesive civilization, but this film proves that all these Asian countries are anything but. Takata seems completely helpless, at the mercy of his guide (who barely speaks a word of Japanese) and the rest of the Chinese citizens. Cultural differences are made abundantly clear. Takata is extremely reclusive and has trouble expressing his emotions and feelings, whereas the Chinese characters are much more open with themselves and with each other.Another aspect of the film I particularly enjoyed was Takata's attempts to learn about his son. He would ask his guide and the rest of the people in the area what his son was like, believing they were friends because of his son's frequent trips to the village. What he learns is that he son was just as quiet and reclusive as he is, detached from society. A bittersweet moment: to finally, after all these years of not speaking, learn things about his son and find out who he was and what he was like, only to find out he was the same as his father, a quiet and lonely recluse, unable to open up to the world.Some of the best moments of the film come when Takata visits the remote village to find the son of the jailed opera singer. Takata seems to open up and connect with this boy in a way he was never able to with his own son. Overall, this is a beautiful film. The running theme is alienation and the lack of communication amongst people, notably Takata and his son. The characters are engaging and its amazing to watch the attempted communication between people at various levels of human relations."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"""Riding alone for Thousands of Miles"" opens to a stark sounding voice, singing, almost screaming words we cannot understand to a tune that is utterly unfamiliar to the western ear. You don't know the meaning or the sentiment of what you hear, nor if it is any good. The song of Chinese Opera is incomprehensible to some when to others it is the representation of high art. The movie comes across much in the same way with the performances moving so closely along culture specific lines foreign to western perception. The personal journey of growth, the emotional turmoil and celebration of unconditional paternal love will be captivating for some and insipid for others. Regardless of you appreciation for a slow pace and stories about small social observations, ""Riding alone"" is well accomplished within its genre. The performances are impressive, the photography is beautiful and the story is compelling. This is the story: Gou-ichi Takata (Ken Takakura) is a man of few words. Widowed and estranged from his only son Ken-ichi, he receives a letter from his daughter in law Rie (Shinobu Terajima) informing him that his son has fallen ill. Following her plea to make peace, Mr. Takata arrives at the Tokio hospital, hoping for reconciliation but finding only refusal. As a token, Rie offers the old man a video tape of Ken-ichi's last film project and he begins to discover the world his son is drawn to: a devotee to classic Chinese opera, Ken-ichi has been documenting the performances of famed opera singer Li Jiamin. During his last visit to the Chinese Yunnan Province he urged Li Jiamin to perform the song 'Riding alone for Thousands of Miles', but not feeling well the singer declined and promised to be ready for his camera next year. Knowing his son won't ever be able to return to Yunnan, Mr. Takata leaves for China to film the opera performance for his dying son. So Mr. Takata's own 'Thousand Mile' journey begins. Determined, he navigates through the maze of Chinese village life, political institutions and social rule. With the help of translators, some more, some less accomplished, he is unaware of the comedic circumstances he creates but always meeting kindness and support."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Yimou Zhang marks the beauty of cultural traditions and differences. I found it very interesting how Yang Yang and Mr. Takata communication with different languages. There was a beautiful connection between them and how they came understand one another. Mr. Takata, an elderly man who is quite stubborn and reserved, traveled to China from Japan to videotape a Chinese folk opera singer, Li Jiamin for his son, Kenichi, whom he had neglected after his wife's death. I found it very fascinating how he had to go to China to get to know his son, Kenichi. He had a few decades to talk to his son but everything changed once he had learned that Kenichi was very ill and hospitalized. The power of a man and his son reconnecting again brings this story to a whole different level. This situation made you realize how you can know someone for years and realize you never really knew them at all.At first, I thought this was going to be a simple movie about a man's quest to reunite with his son and ultimately end up doing so, but you will not find the typical Hollywood movie ending here. Throughout the film, Mr. Takata is determined to meet a Chinese folk opera star, Li Jiamin in order to record him performing for his opera loving son. As the man's trip progresses, he crosses paths with villages who help him along his journey to find Li Jiamin and complete his objective. Mr. Takata and the audience both do not expect to get more out of the trip than originally plan. I could not imagine what was going to happen as the story unfolded. When Mr. Takata finally gains access to meet a now prisoner, Li Jiamin, the guards try to force Li Jiamin to perform but he is not stable and breaks down crying because he misses his son, Yang Yang, whom he has never met.Mr. Takata makes a big decision and decides he wants to bring these two together, perhaps because he knows this is the only way Li Jiamin was agree to perform. On the day Mr. Takata and Yang Yang were suppose to meet with Li Jiamin, Yang Yang runs away and hides somewhere within the mountains. Mr. Takata finds him but they are stuck together for the night until they can find help in the morning. During their time alone, Yang Yang becomes hostile towards Mr. Takata but the two eventually befriend one another. Mr. Takata expresses how he feels holding Yang Yang as if he were his son. The next day the police and villagers spread out into the mountains and find the two. When Mr. Takata learns that Kenichi is passed away, he still continues on his journey and returns to the prison to meet with Li Jiamin again. He asks Yang Yang if he wants to meet his father even after the villagers spoke for him and were forcing him to go with Mr. Takata but Mr. Takaka realizes that even as a child, he is allowed to make his own decisions just as Kenichi made his decision to not see his father, which is similar to how Li Jiamin did not want to perform but the guards tried to force the request. Yang Yang does not want go with Mr. Takata to the prison.I think one of the themes of the film was to ''Redeem yourself'' as heard in the prison. In the end, out of selflessness, respect, thankfulness, Mr. Takata did not ask Li Jiamin to perform and instead showed him pictures of his adorable son, which was an even bigger gift than anyone had expected because it brought another father and son together. Many of the prisoners were also touched by this gift. Li Jiamin felt very thankful he vowed to give Mr. Takata his best performance."

Father have always loved their sons and Yimoy is trying to show this love form a father for his son. He did a great job og showing the father regret fot what he has done for his son. Also how he is going to make it up to his son. It is hard for a man to swallow his pride, but in this film Yimoy shows that even thought it is hard, but his son is more important to him him than his pride. also the sons understanding of his father pain at the end of the movie is admirable. The son knows that they both made mistake in their relationsship, but because of his love for his dad he tends to forget."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Zhang Yimou, mostly known for his martial art and SIG films, takes on a different approach to his film Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles. It tells the story of a Japanese fisherman, Takada, who's son has an incurable disease. Takada wants to redeem himself and receive forgiveness from his son. He sets out on a journey to China to film a Chinese folk Opera, Riding Alone for thousands of miles, which his son wanted to go back and film. On his journey Takada learns about his son and about himself. He realizes that although he is in a different culture, everyone is connected, which helps him understand the love for a child. In this film we see that Zhang Yimou films both China and Japan different. The different textures, and color tones distinguish both cultures."
千里走单骑,Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles (2005),,2005,2006.09.01,"Parallelism is a great thing, but director Zhang Yimou can't seem to parallel anything less cliché (and clichéd as an ""Asian"" trademark) than fathers who feel blue about their sons on top of feeling blue about themselves. This movie does not aim to move by persuasion (through music, escalation of dramatic action, etc.) but by unrelenting monotony of images that Zhang feels ""ought to move."" The literal manifestation of the opera aria ""Walking a thousand miles.."" in the main character's trek through remote China will amuse but for a second; there are many films in which going the distance figures as a significant motif-- Elizabeth Bennett, for example, walks around a lot-- as does Forest Gump. For them it means closing certain distances. Here, the journey is tedious and obnoxious not as a ""visceral representation of the interiorities of the fathers,"" no, but rather as a stilted and somewhat queasy overextention of the camera and the story.For those still in the closet of, if a movie is ethnic specifically about an ethnic pastime (opera here), if this said movie reaffirms the bonds of blood amongst estranged kin, and finally, if this movie has smokey-bluish mountain scenes (of anywhere, location hardly matters) then not giving patronage to this film up lands one in the uncultured dog hole--- let it go already. Try some of Zhang's earlier works, which still pulses with life blood, and which earnestly document the exit and reentry of shattered lives in the world."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Though perhaps 'Still Life'/'Sanxia haoren' (the Variety reviewer thought so) is primarily for the Jia devotee or the festival-goer (it's already been awarded the Golden Lion at Venice) and certainly it's totally noncommercial, it's a lovely, hypnotic piece of work, another haunting picture of the vast creation, disruption, destruction that is modern China from that country's most exciting and original younger-generation filmmaker.There are layers of irony in the title, because in the incredibly turbulent, ceaselessly active events on screen in this world of life that is anything but ""still,"" the most amazing images slip by without comment. A construction boss on a rampart one evening cell-phones a technician and says, ""The VIP's are here. Why aren't the lights on? I'll count to three; then turn on. One, two, three. . ."" and a huge bridge and arch are suddenly illuminated behind him. One of the two estranged couples the film follows to tentative reunions is talking with a vast city behind them and in the background a big skyscraper suddenly, silently collapses. There is no comment. It just miraculously happens. In the final shot, amid the debris of the Three Gorges where the world's largest dam will eventually displace 1.4 million people, Han Sanming (non-actor Han Sanming's actual name), a mine worker who's come to find his wife and daughter, who left him sixteen years ago, stands looking out at the urban landscape and a trapeze artist is quietly walking across a tightrope between tall buildings. Again, no comment.Han Sanming can't find his wife right away and her brother doesn't trust him at first, so he stays for months, working with the brother in demolition. A perky young fellow, who quotes John Wu star Chow Yun Fat and imitates Hong Kong gangster gestures, befriends Han Sanming and they put each other's numbers in their cell phones--a contemporary pledge of solidarity that has a sad sequel later. The young fellow, who could easily have been one of the lost, hopeful young men in Jia's 2002 Unknown Pleasures, is lost in a demolition accident and gets a sea burial like the one accorded to Johnny Depp's character in Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man.Focused on the displacement of people for a vast industrial and engineering project, Still Life also contrasts classes--the humble working-class stiff who can make 50 yuan a day pulling down walls or 200 going down in a coal mine not knowing if he'll come back out, versus the handsome lady, Shen Hong (Zhao Tao) whose estranged building magnate husband she wants to divorce because she's found a younger man. She has options; Han Sanming is simply drifting and lonely. And in the background for both, though, is the enormous turbulence and activity in which we see both protagonists as tiny helpless figures, their own lives indeed ""still life"" by comparison.There's another unexpected, astonishing sequence of a fat rock singer, naked from the waist up like most of the Three Gorges demolition workers Han Sanming encounters and drenched in sweat. He sings of nostalgia for his youth, a time when everybody was happy , and old men in the audience shed tears while garish go-go girls gyrate: where does this fit in? This is another symbol of social upheaval. But what is really happening? Won't Chinese society have to return to its heritage of Mao and the Eighties aftermath chronicled in another of Jia's unwieldy masterpieces, the 2000 Platform? Perhaps the titles Still Life ironically points to the way people are frozen in isolation (broken couples, estranged children) and unhappiness (or quiet desperation) in a China that all the rampant economic progress both masks and perpetuates.After his colorful land pointed but somewhat leaden 2004 The World/Shijie Jia Zhang-Ke has shown again as in Platform and Unknown Pleasures that he can touch and astonish. The human events are dwarfed by capitalist Progress in the new China, but people (after all, they are a zillion of them there) are still very much in the foreground. \Still Life is an impressive, organic-feeling movie that refers to Jia's earlier films but, extraordinarily, seems to bring together both post-war Italian neo-realism and the desolate urban landscapes of Michelangelo Antonioni.Seen in Paris, October 21, 2007 at the MK2 Hautefeuille."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"China's sixth generation director Jia Zhang-ke's recent Golden Lion winner at Venice is slightly more accessible to the general audience than his previous work, although Shijie (2004) has been heading generally towards that direction. Unlike Xiao Wu (1997), which is completely devoid of story or plot, Still Life at least has a story (in fact two) of sorts but, to Jia credit, stays away from the conventional Hollywood melodrama formula. The last thing we need is another Hollywood-look-alike movie made by a Chinese director who gives up what he is good at to impersonate a Hollywood director. There are already too many.The story of the Three Gorges Dam begs to be told. Jia tells it from a micro, personal angle, by weaving two separate stories together, with the Three Gorges Dam project not just as a backdrop, but also as a subject of enquiry. In polarized contrast to the gorgeous tourism posters, Jia's camera shows the devastation along the Gorges in a way that almost reminds you of the ruins in Polanski's ""The pianist"". In the two unrelated stories, two people arrive in the same riverside town, a nurse looking for her husband who seems to have lost interest in her, and a coalminer searching for his wife who left him, taking with her their daughter.These stories are told in Jia's usual minimalist style, but with pain sticking attention to details. Instead of the dialogue, it's the nuances, the body language, and even the framing of the shot that reveals. New to Jia's screen are moments of playful, surprising touches as if the director is saying ""Hey, I can handle surreal too"". The appropriate use of pop music from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Mainland of China adds to the dimension and depth of the film.True to his tradition, Jia films the life of ordinary people just as it is. The coalminer in Still Life is one in real life, and a relative of Jia. He even uses his real name Han San-ming. True to his tradition again, Jia uses only one professional actor, Zhao Tao, but she is so good that you can't tell her apart from the rest of the ""cast"" in terms of being an authentic, ordinary person that Jia might have just picked from a crowd in the street.I miss Jia's earlier work such a Xiao Wu, for its uniqueness and detached, realistic depiction of lives of real people. On the other hand, I don't mind his introduction of conventional ""entertaining"" elements, so long as he stops before, way before, succumbing to the senseless scramble of the Chinese 5th generation directors to capture the Hollywood market. Many a soul has been sold for fame and fortune."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"This week China announced that about 300,000 more people than planned will be relocated as a result of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, bringing the total displaced to more than 1.4 million. The $22.5-billion US dam, a mega-project five times the size of the Hoover Dam, which has been heavily criticized by environmental and human rights groups, was begun in 1993 but will not go into full operation until 2008. The project's effect on ordinary Chinese is the focus of Jia Zhangke's latest film, Still Life, the surprise winner of the Golden Lion Award at this year's Venice Film Festival.Set in the village of Fengjie, since submerged in water to make way for the dam, Jia's slow-paced, class-conscious effort dramatizes the life of villagers who have been forced from their homes, had their traditional way of life destroyed, and sent to live in cities against their will, often having to resort to begging and garbage collecting, or even prostitution to stay alive. The film, along with its companion documentary Dong, tells overlapping stories of the emotional trauma of local people caught in the dislocation at Fengjie while a new village is being built.In the first sequence, Han Sanming, a middle-aged coal miner from Jia's home Shanxi province, arrives on a ferry to look for his ex-wife, Missy after sixteen years of estrangement. All he has to rely on is an address given to him many years ago, completely unaware of the demolition and flooding in the area. Avoiding local swindlers, he tracks down Missy's uncle who tells him that his former wife is now in Yichang with his teenage daughter. Staying on to work in the demolition projects, Han engages in conversations with other workers who complain of the low wages they are receiving (60 to 70 Yuan a day) and want to return to Shanxi province with Han where they can earn 200 Yuan a day working in the dangerous coal mines.In the second story, Shen Hong (Zhao Tao), a nurse arrives from Shanxi as well and is also searching for a missing person, her husband Guo Bin, who left the family two years ago. She is aided in her search by archaeologist Wang Dongming but it is uncertain what course of action Shen has in mind when she reunites with her husband. The film, however, is not about the story line but about the landscape and the atmosphere, playfully charged by the CG appearance of a UFO and a spaceship that takes off in the middle of the rubble.In Still Life, Jia demonstrates to the world how one of China's most gorgeous areas, one that brings in 1.3 million tourists a year, has become a scene of squalor. Jia says: ""We all know there is major change going on in China and I wanted to get more people to know what's happening. I will continue to make films along these lines and explore the problems of the weaker social classes."" If Jia's future projects contain the unmatched cinematography, compelling story, and characters whose lives touch us as Still Life, we have much to look forward to."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I've seen lots of presentations by businesspeople and academics about Chinese industry, development, social problems, politics, progress, environmental disasters, etc. etc. I've never seen anything like this. It's China on the ground - actually a town about to be submerged by the Three Gorgest Dam project. The title translation of ""Three Gorges Good People"" is right - these are ordinary folks who endure, persist, help each other out, etc. in a mixed landscape of natural beauty, building, poverty, and destruction that has to be seen to be understood. The story of the dam shapes everybody's life without actually determining or washing them out. Definitely try to see this if you have any interest at all in China today."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Still Life touches upon all the problems surrounding the controversial issue of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam but it only presents short glimpses of this reality, like colorful splashes of paint onto a palette: we see the young sixteen year old begging the outsider to take her away and find a job for her as a maid in a big city, panels indicating the phases of demolition, the word ""demolition"" painted outside people's residences, workers pulling down constructions, land compensation, relocation and myriads of hints at the inside stories of the people: helplessness, cynicism, acceptance, nostalgia.The plot is very simple: a coal miner coming to the Three Gorges in search of his wife, whom he hasn't seen in sixteen years and a woman in search of her husband, whom she hasn't seen in three years. The human stories, set against the background of the Three Gorges and the Yangtze River, are fleeting, fragile, ethereal. The characters' journey is both physical and psychological. They both have traveled from Shanxi province in search of their wife and husband but their journey is also a journey into consciousness, nostalgia, loss and the past. Besides, it is also a crucial step before a new future. Along with the nostalgia and the lingering on what is lost, there is also a constant need to make decisions and move on, which is what the characters do. We, spectators, follow the characters at the same time as we/they make a journey into the Three Gorges. The connection between the characters and the landscape is obvious. The journey is not only into the characters' past but also a hint at the past of the Three Gorges, at all the villages which have been pulled down and at those who are about to disappear. The sense of loss in the characters' lives is unmistakably connected to the Three Gorges, to that which is already lost and to what is about to be taken away.The film is definitely a beautiful and poetic reflection on time. The coal miner, Han Sanming, keeps the address of his former wife written on an old pack of cigarettes. When a young boy asks him what they are, he replies that they used to be the best brand of cigarettes sixteen years ago. The boy says he is too nostalgic, and to this, Han Sanming answers gravely that ""we all remember our pasts"". Yet Still Life is not only about time lost. There are also celebrations of the present. Han Sanming's determination to try again with his ex-wife is a note of optimism and hope. Various scenes in the film also show villagers dancing, enjoying a singing performance, where the camera lingers on their expressions of joy and enthusiasm, a clear celebration of life.All the films I've seen about the Three Gorges and the Dam share a strong emphasis on the visual, arguably because the gripping power of the landscape cannot make it otherwise. Still Life is not an exception. One of its signs of distinction, which greatly accounts for the beauty of the film, is the way in which it is shot. The motion of the camera is always very slow and contemplative. It moves along the river banks as well as along objects and characters' faces in a fashion similar to that of a ship moving along the river. This slow, balanced, contemplative motion also recalls the movement of water, and brings to the viewer notions of fluidity, transformation and renewal. The background of the Three Gorges and the Yangzte is always there. Many takes show the contrast of the characters' insignificance against the overwhelming vastness of the landscape, and this is also done with objects. As Han Sanming contemplates a 10 Yuan note, the close take of the note is again set against the background of the Gorges. To all this must be added the attention to detail: the humanity of people's conversations, the taste of local Sichuan people, the colors, the contrasts. To me, Still Life is not only a cinematographic accomplishment. It is also evidence that people still remember, at this very important moment in time, the Three Gorges and its people."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Ancient towns have been submerged along the Yangtse River in China as part of the Three Gorges Dam project. Jia Zhang-Ke has created a contemplative and compassionate human drama set in the region, depicting two separate protagonists attempting to locate missing ones who lived in areas now underwater.I'm not a great fan of high definition digital video photography, but this sublime film takes advantage of the benefits of the technology while avoiding most of the pitfalls. I was seriously sleep-deprived while watching the film and never got close to nodding off, even though there are very long takes where little seems to happen. Yet in takes, there are many passing details, the beautiful movements of camera taking in rich and authentic details of people, situations, implements, household paraphernalia and gorgeous sweeping vistas. The latter appeared to be enhanced using filters, which seemed to compensate for the loss of aesthetics that comes from not shooting on 35mm film. This film was visually beautiful, though that really only served what was an extremely well-made film.As a lover of world cinema, I found the attention to detail fascinating. The director seemed to be sharing the idiosyncrasies of the local culture, customs and demeanour with a real sense of compassion and humanitarianism. I found it poetic, uplifting and moving. Paraphrasing Melbourne International Film Festival executive director Richard Moore's in introduction by quoting the director (who was in attendance as a guest of the festival): ""I originally wanted to make films that would change the world... I now realise this is not possible, and I just wish to make films that make people sigh."" It worked on me."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Reviewed at the North American premiere screening Tues. Sept. 12, 2006 at the Varsity 8 Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).I was lucky enough to be at TIFF screenings on Monday when it was announced that Sanxia Haoren was going to have a special one-time screening as a last minute addition to the Visions programme of TIFF 2006. I think the online tickets went fairly quickly and the theatre was packed with a considerable overflow of film writers & critics who had been unable to squeeze into the industry screening.Sanxia Haoren has been given the title Still Life for international release, but the original Chinese title would seem to translate simply as Three Gorges Good People and it is in the vicinity of the dam's construction and the city demolitions and the people displacement entailed by it, that the film takes place. The film has a bookend plot of a miner Han Sanming (character's and actor's names are identical) who comes to the town of Fengjie to search for his estranged wife and child. The centrepiece story is that of a nurse named Shen Hong who is searching for her missing husband.The dour faced Han Sanming is initially a cause of concern as it seems at the very start he is going to be swindled by tricksters on the river ferry but he soon shows that he can hold his own. We then think he is going to conned by a sarcastic motorcycle taxi driver who takes him to the location of his supposed house only for him to find it is now submerged under water. Things soon settle down for Han though as he finds lodging in a boarding house and work as a house demolition man on a crew with a brash young man who seems to have learned all his life lessons from the movies of Chow Yun Fat. Various humorous interludes (such as a young boy who sneaks cigarettes and roams around singing overly romantic songs which usually degenerate into an off-key screech by their end) and certain magic sequences (which I won't spoil) serve to bring comedy and wonder along the way. Several times the screen is seemingly chapter titled with the words ""cigarette"", ""liquor"", ""tea"" and ""toffee"", when these items occur during the plot, and any other meaning to this device eluded me. The journey of Shen Hong is similarly full of encounters with different characters on the way. I don't think the two stories actually intersected, but I may have been somewhat tired at this mid-way mark of TIFF as this screening went from 10:30 pm to 12:30 am.The impression that the actors were perhaps simply playing versions of themselves was reinforced later in the week when I also caught the same director's documentary ""Dong"" which follows painter Liu Xiao-dong around locations at the Three Gorges Dam and it turned out that Han Sanming was actually one of the sturdy workmen that painter Liu was using for his models in a large multi-paneled painting of men. A blond-dye haired motorcycle taxi driver of Still Life makes a cameo appearance in Dong as well.I found both of these films equally absorbing as they told stories of regular people in somewhat extreme life-changing situations and also that the 2 films complemented each other in a symbiotic way. Seeing one will enhance your appreciation of the other and vice versa. Both films are very deliberately paced but very lyrical and if you have an appreciation for slower paced film they are very rewarding. Also, if you did not have any concept of the magnitude of what is going on in the Three Gorges area, these films will give you a first hand view. The director Jia Zhang-ke was not in attendance for the North American premiere, as he presumably was still in Venice celebrating his win of the Golden Lion for this film and 2 awards for the documentary."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"The comment which was written before mine gives a great and brilliant explanation of the social problems and facts that involves this film, so I am not going to repeat it. I prefer to talk about another one of the most relevant aspects of this movie: the photography, magisterially directed by Yu Likwai. Sometimes one can have the impression to be watching a photo album, further than a movie. There are no bad or ugly photo-grams in this film. Every image contains a really fine sense of photography as an art, including superb landscapes, exiting colors, and intelligent compositions with everything and everybody in the right place, without unaesthetic gaps. A pleasure for eyes and soul."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Zhang Ke Jia is a director who produces mixed feelings in me. On the one hand, I think he's a fantastic filmmaker as far as the technical aspects go, but I think his writing is pretty generic, especially when it comes to his characters, and he often relies on some hoary art movie clichés. Still Life is no exception, though it probably ranks as my favorite of Jia's films so far. Its worth is perhaps the result of a lucky accident more than anything. During the creation of the monumental Three Gorges Dam project in China, Jia filmed this movie while a city was being disassembled before it was to be flooded. Therefore, you get these beautiful, eerie scenes of this decaying, emptying city. The bifurcated story follows two characters, a man and a woman, as they seek for their ex-wife and current (but estranged) husband respectively. Structurally, it's kind of weird, because the woman's story pops up randomly in the middle of the man's story and has no relation to it. After her story ends, the film returns to the man and finishes his. I like the stories, but the characters are rather bland. I kept looking past them to the dreamy images behind."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Known previously as a documentary, and not as a romance, ""Sanxia Haoren"" (""Still Life"") was the surprise  and last  film in Venice Festival (Italy) and not even the first one film of the young maker (he already had another movie in competition). Mr Jia shows us China just as it is nowadays. Not the power of huge works, or the beautiful scenery, just as the Dam on the Yangsi River nearby, but simple Chinese people, with simple problems, that do not know nothing such happiness (yet). It's heartbreaking, it's wonderfully filmed, it's like a superb painting. A simple masterpiece (and not only a Golden Lion). The surprise at Venice's Mostra. Catherine Deneuve, the French president of the jury of Venice, was very moved by Jia's work, the story told and the emotion of that film."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I think this is an outstanding movie.Having lived in China for the last 3 years, I've not seen a movie that so completely encompasses the reality of life here. The sounds, the smells, the touch of real life saturates this film.For Sinophiles everywhere this is a must-watch movie.China aside, the cinematography feels like a work of art. The slow panning camera, the oblique angles, the over long lingering of the camera on the scenes, the moments of surreality in what is otherwise a movie grounded in the ""real"", the beautiful stills etc...The movie is full of humanity and compassion, great depth and emotion.More people should watch this!"

三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Every so often a film comes along that, after having done the festival circuit, is laden with awards and praise, and quickly becomes a 'must see film'. 90% of the time it is easy to see just why that film won the awards, got all the praise etc, but once in a while such a film arrives that you watch and, after it has finished, you shrug your shoulders and think to yourself ""yeh, so what!"" Unfortunately I personally found this film one such case. I just could not fathom as to what the film was trying to say about contemporary China, the past or just about anything for that matter. A man arrives, finds his old village under water due to the Three Gorges Dam project, and he begins a fairly hopeless search for his wife and child. Meanwhile, following a strange object in the sky, another female is also searching for her husband, finds him and... well, just and! In amongst this are some very odd touches, like the aforementioned object in the sky, and a strange sculpture that suddenly lifts off like a rocket! Like, wow man! There are some nice touches - like when the bridge is lit up, and some of the photography is stunning, but overall I found that the film lacked any dramatic drive, the secondary character were all inter-changeable, and, for a film lasting just over 1 1/2 hours it felt so LONG! I know it is tantamount to filmatic treason to heavily criticise such a film, but to my mind this film was nothing short of the Emperior's New Clothes."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Chinese director Zhang Ke Jia's latest film contains a wealth of fascinating real-life imagery. Still Life was filmed during the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in China and it reveals to Western audiences the astonishing destruction that this entailed. The submersion of the scenery and settlements of the valley floors proceeds in phases during the film. White lines are painted on buildings and cliff-faces to forewarn of the next projected rise in water levels; residents are forced from their homes at short notice. Buildings are torn down using sledgehammers and hard human labour, creating a bizarre landscape of broken masonry. Rubble, the raw material of the future, is carted along narrow city streets by overloaded lorries and dumped onto a fleet of cargo ships. In the wake of all this activity there lie towns and communities divided literally in two by the swelling waters.Still Life is an amazing documentary of the construction of the Dam, but its narrative is disappointingly weak. So many of the characters that fill the screen are isolated or antagonistic or exploitative, from the man hawking foreign currencies to the architect proudly admiring the new bridge across town. Jia chooses to focus on two main characters, creating two loosely intertwined plots. In the first, a husband and father searches for his wife and daughter who left him some fifteen years previously, whilst in the second an abandoned wife searches for her missing husband.These are potentially interesting stories, but they proceed at a pace that is slow even by the standards of Jia's other films. Much of the drama in these stories precedes the film itself and the camera often lingers on unmoving, unspeaking subjects. The effect is one of inertia, at first strangely engrossing, but eventually frustrating. Possibly in an attempt to alleviate the slow, slow pacing of Still Life, Jia introduces some quirky asides (watch out for the spaceship taking off), but these jar with his documentary-like approach to film-making. Rather more effective are the 'still life' moments that crop up periodically throughout the film, momentarily framing day-to-day objects such as cigarettes or tea.Although achingly slow at times, Still Life does make some interesting observations. It is intriguing to see how pop culture, transmitted by television and radio, now provides the icons for young Chinese people, where once one might have expected the songs, the sayings and the thinking to derive from Communist figureheads. The boy singing romantic pop ballads and the young man imitating a TV cop show character are symbolic of a very different culture among the young people of China. As with Jia's other films, the ideology and rhetoric of the Communist Party are largely absent, making a sort of cameo appearance when an old-fashioned workers' song plays as the ring tone on one character's mobile phone.On the other hand, we see very little protest against the construction of the dam under the gaze of the Communist Party. This is not a slight against Jia, however, since it would have been very difficult to portray this without the government intervening against his film. The unflattering portrayal of the Dam's construction and its debilitating influence on people are a wake-up call to the severe side effects of Progress."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I felt asleep during Jia Zhang Ke's ""Platform"", unable to understand why the camera was still filming, whereas nothing much was happening on the screen : a bus disappearing in the back of a wonderful landscape took five minutes in this movie (it's true that it's coming back after a quite long time). I was wandering if the director himself didn't felt to sleep while shooting this scene, and was then unable to say ""CUT"". That's why I didn't watch ""Unknown pleasure"" nor ""The world"", despite of all the good critics. But I was curious to see ""Still Life"", thanks to the melancholic tone of the trailer and some of the interviews of Jia Zhang Ke, who claimed to explore the problem of the weaker social classes of china in this movie, and tended to do a more classical melodramatic movie. I was really looking forward a postcard of contemporary China (because Cinema sometimes allows us to peak a slice of a life you cannot experience by yourself). So, I just took a ticket for Fengjiie, a local town of the Three Gorge in the South China area, where the movie happens. And I have to say that Jia Zhang Ke did some improvement as a director since ""Platform"" : when he lets his camera filming, something finally happens, a errant dog can come out of nowhere after a while for instance : thanks to that new sense of timing, I never felt asleep during ""Still Life"".In fact, the movie is really fascinating for it shows real people in a catastrophic area and you really have the feeling that it somehow shows us a part of reality of contemporary china. You travel when you watch this movie whiteout having the feeling of being a tourist, witch is quite interesting from a sociological point of view. The message of the movie also increases the documentary perspective of the movie, and archive to give an emotional impact to it : it's an all world that is disappearing while the rebuilding changes the face of the region towards ""modernity"", and the first to suffer from this disappearing are the people, who are literally lost in a universe they don't belong to anymore (that certainly explain the Sci-Fi incursions of the film). A character even quotes Chow Yun-Fat in John Woo's ""A better tomorrow"", and underlines the idea that the character of the movie don't fit to the changes that occur in China, saying that ""We're too nostalgic for these times"". It's quite strange, however, to see how Jia Zhang Ke tries to compare his weaker social class characters to Woo's beautiful anti-heroes.But if the documentary/sociological part is quite interesting, the movie also suffers from several flaws, that, in my opinion, both contradict the sociological interest and seriously parasites the emotional impact of the movie. The movie is for instance divided in two parts, each telling an individual story, witch are thematically and geographically connected (a man and a woman are looking for people they used to love in the Three Gorge area) and they are like a mirror of each another (the two stories are playing with oppositions such as man/woman  poor/rich  the reconstruction of a family/the end of another one, etc.). But the thing is that instead of unity, this over intellectualized rupture seems artificially made, as if the director wanted to add something to his first idea (certainly the male story, because the woman's one is definitely shorter, witch contradicts the balance effect), in order to increase its meaning and generalize his point of view. All this structural game seems too me too demonstrative and artificial to works in a movie witch claim to reach the reality of people.And I sensed the same contradiction with the way the director tends to reach reality : he uses a series of artifice and ""dispositifs"" that tend to capture reality, but that only shows cinema and art to me. I'm for instance talking about the way Jia Zhang Ke allows improvisations to a certain controlled space to his non-professional actors. That artificiality gave me the feeling to be more a filter of reality, than a pair of glasses that allows us to see it more carefully. And I think that that wasn't what the director wanted us to feel in front of his movie."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Like the recent Australian drama ""Jindabyne,"" ""Still Life"" examines what happens to the members of a community when the place they call home is deliberately flooded to make way for a new dam. In ""Still Life,"" it is the city of Fengjie that now lies at the bottom of the Yangtze River, its population scattered and its submerged buildings, roads and parks nothing more than memories for those who once lived there (the Three Gorges Dam was completed in 2006). There are also plans to further raise the level of the river, resulting in the eventual loss of much of the surrounding area that still remains above water. As a result of the order to evacuate, what little is left of the city becomes ever more of a ghost town as the movie goes on.Han Sanming returns to the area after 16 long years, unaware of what has happened to the town in his absence. He then goes in search of the ex-wife and teenaged daughter he hasn't seen in all that time, seeking news of their whereabouts from family members, acquaintances and total strangers he meets along the way. In an unrelated but concomitant plot line, Shen Hong is a woman who returns to the same area to find the husband who all but abandoned her two years earlier.As directed by Zhang Ke Jia, ""Still Life"" is less a narrative-driven drama than a methodically-paced, contemplative look at people whose lives have been torn asunder by the ""advancement"" of modern technology but who have been so beaten down by an unfeeling bureaucracy that they have all but resigned themselves to a passive acceptance of their fate. Yet, all this is dealt with in an elliptical and oblique fashion as the two main characters focus primarily on the concerns of their own personal relationships and issues. But the true meaning of the film can be found in the penetrating and soul-crushing air of melancholy that hangs over the work."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Still Life (2006/2008) ****What a lonely place the world is for so many. As we lurch forward in the name of modernity we always seem ironically becoming more and more isolated as the world around us gets smaller and smaller. This conflict lies at the heart of Zhang Ki Jia's haunting film Still Life. Although the film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 and received widespread praise, it only finally received a very limited theatrical run in North America this year. The film revolves around two stories shot and set in the Fengjie area as it is being demolished and flooded for the Three Gorges Damn (that area is now totally underwater). One involves a man looking for his wife, who left him with their daughter 16 years ago. He's worked in the mines since then, and upon arriving home does not realize that the valley has been flooded. He searches around until he finds her brother. He informs him that she works upriver on a boat now. He can't see her until her boat arrives there. In the mean time, he makes friends with a young man called Mark, who bases his personality around the roles of Chow Yun Fat. The two work demolishing old ruins by hand with sledgehammers, while waiting for the estranged wife to return to town. The second story follows a nurse who comes to the area looking for her husband, who she has not heard from in two years. She enlists the help of one of his friends to help find him. She suspects rightly that her husband is having an affair. She discovers he is now quite successful, and having an affair with his female investor. When she finally gets to see him, she walks away. When he follows she tells him she is in love with someone else and wants a divorce. Is she really? Does she really? We can suspect, but humans are funny creatures. These stories are only marginally interconnected. There are threads that connect them, but only randomly. The two are even on the same boat and witness the same strange event but are totally unaware of each other. The strange event that the two witness is only one of a few that I would dare not reveal. They seem so strangely surreal in what appears to be such a grounded film. They're perplexing, but I think serve to highlight our tiny existence in an infinite world. Jia films with a patient eye, allowing the camera to move slowly and linger on its inhabitants. It's a gorgeous looking movie, special for capturing a 2000 year old landscape in its death throws. There will never be another film like it, because those places no longer exist. That valley is the real star of the film. It's a haunting and otherworldly place where, despite the heat, the sun never shines. Despite the film's focus on the destruction of time and place and our collective loneliness in the modern world, it's also a testament to the depth and capacity of the human spirit to triumph. Yes we are but small blimps on the world's radar, a world that isolates and alienates us, but we cope and strive. How? In the connections that bond us as humans. The physical world around us may be washed away, but the friendships and connections we make - no matter how small - remind us that it is often the smallest joys in life that mean the most. And with that, we persevere."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"The Three Gorges Dam project in China, which will provide hydroelectric power but will cause the submersion of villages along the river bank, is the background of this film. Along with that, the film documents the stories of Sanming and Shen Hong, whose respective spouses have left them. Both are traveling to villages that are going to be submerged and are currently being demolished by unskilled labor, to find them. The cinematography in this film is excellent, illustrating the perpetually foggy conditions and the demolition work that is being done. The two people who star in this film play this so much like real life the movie seems almost like an intimate documentary. The story told in this film is one that is going on right now, mainly people being displaced from their homes and being sent elsewhere. The film is almost at a glacial pace, but that is necessary. I was more interested in Shen Hong's story until Sanming's story was resolved. This film has some sadness attached to it, you do feel for these displaced people. This film is not for everyone due to its slow pacing, but its an important film about the Three Gorges Dam project, how it affects the people impacted directly. Not all progress is good for everyone."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"During the last century the global interdependency has reached proportions, that surpass the human imagination. The unification is accompanied by a global shift in power towards the densely populated Asia. If I had to make a bet between China and India as the future superpower, I would put my money on China - because of its equality and even income distribution. Although it is also possible that one or both of these countries will eventually fall apart into smaller countries. Nevertheless, it seems wise to get a better understanding of the people that make our clothes and electronic appliances. So what does the film Still Life tell us? In fact it is composed of two panels, which portray the old and new life in China. They merge at the start of the film, when a ferry brings a woman and a man to a town (Sandouping?) on the border of the Yangtze river. The woman is married to an official of the communist party. They lived in another province, but he was ordered by the party to supervise construction works near the Three Gorges Dam. They haven't't seen each other for years, and now the woman wants to file for a divorce. She just needs his signature on the legal documents. It takes some time to find him, and when they finally meet there is some hesitation. He makes some protestations, which however are not really convincing. So she leaves just like she came. The other panel follows the man on the boat. Unlike the previous couple he is not a white collar worker, but a simple worker. Several decades ago he was married by appointment, through buying his future wife. They got a daughter, and subsequently she left him. Now he wants to meet her, under the pretense that he wants to see his daughter. He tries to find her village, but it was swallowed by the river, after the dam had been installed. So he takes a job as a demolisher of the old communist tenement houses. The working conditions are extremely simple, just using a sledge hammer, with no protection against dust or asbestos. He rents a room, and lives together with the other workers. The living conditions are clearly those of a developing country, however with some modern appliances such as mobile phones. During his searches he visits the former state factory, where his wife used to work. It has been closed as part of the new economic policy. At last he finds her on a boat, where she is the housekeeper of the owner. The boat owner pays her with food and shelter (so what is usually called the informal economy). The worker talks with his wife. Eventually he wants to take her back, which means paying a debt to the boat owner (which will cost him a year of labor). I guess the film is about change: both on the cultural and economic level. The old way of life is disappearing, although some of its primitive traditions prove to remain viable - and even more robust than some of the new habits. The new economic system has removed the certainty and protection, that were typical of the communist state. More and more the people move from the rural areas to the industrial regions. The dialogs are slow and simple, just as the narrative as a whole, but nevertheless touching. This low pace is also a hallmark of many Russian films, and it may be a remnant of the recent agricultural and feudal society. The film is also about the need to cherish relations, but here the message is mixed. For me the most informative parts are probably the primitive working and living conditions even in urban China. And the effects of the changing policies of the communist party. If you are interested in social films, but prefer somewhat more excitement, you may find my other reviews interesting."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I'm going to rip on this movie so much, so first I'll talk about what I like. I like that it partially deals with a regional issue - a flood which has caused people to move out from the area in which the film takes place. I like the aspect of the two characters having the same quest - looking for somebody to finish unsettled business, though one is more successful than the other.Basically, the rest of the film was not captivating to me at all. There weren't really any memorable lines, and good lines are what people take away from films because words sometimes inspire us more than just the images within film even though film is a visual medium. There was a use of special effects at one point of this film, and I really did not understand its purpose at all. We see this certain structure a few times throughout the film (it is difficult to describe) and at one point, this structure randomly produces fire at its base and takes off like a rocket. It seemed so out of place for this movie, which seemed to deal with very real dramatic situations. Though I know art cinema deals with narration over narrative, the narration wasn't even worth the experience for this film (should I even call it an art film?)Maybe it's just me, but I really didn't relate to any characters in this film, it didn't look great visually, and there was no memorable dialogue in Still Life. While it dealt with dramatic situations this film was the antithesis of entertaining. If you're an avid film critic, give this a spin and prove me wrong, but you will hate this if you're looking for a good time."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I watched Still Life yesterday night, it was recently released over here in Germany. It's a fantastic movie with gorgeous photography and possibly because the lives, lifestyles and scenery depicted in Still Life were so completely alien to me, it felt like a documentary. Great soundtrack, too. I was literally spell-bound, the movie drew me in completely and I felt quite dazed when I walked out of the cinema. I'd watched the movie with a friend and we got talking about our reactions to the film. I would have loved to quiz the rest of the cinema audience as to their reactions to the movie.Still Life received a good bit of positive press over here in Europe (at least in those magazines/papers covering foreign movies/world cinema) but I also know several people who watched it and left halfway through because they were bored and 'there was nothing happening'. And I bet that this was a fairly typical reaction of the average European/Western cinema-goer. Yes, there is an almost total absence of sprightly dialogue or exciting action (unless you count the two UFOs...) and if you grew up with the classic Western/US style of film-making and your usual film fare is whatever Hollywood movies are shown at your local cinema, then Still Life will come as an unpleasant surprise, maybe because it is simply too different in visual style, content, pace and imagery to the average European/Western movie.Personally, I think there should be more of these type of films over here. I really hope Still Life will be released on DVD in Europe otherwise I'll have to order it from a website or something and hang the expense!"
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Jia Zhang-ke has given us a marvelous capsule of China rarely seen on film.His searching husband and wife cross paths looking for their respective mates after years at the only moments the story could have been told.Before the Three Gorges Dam, none of the metaphoric, yet very real destruction of the old towns would have been taking place and three months later they would all be under water.The cinematography allows us to slowly absorb the beauty of the spot on the Yangtze River where the dam is being constructed, while the stark lives of demolition workers play out in contrast.The new China is a runaway engine of modern economy and it is tossing countless lives aside with its speed.These aren't views shown in the films of the previous generation of Chinese directors. Made recently enough to have a direct connection to today, we see a country where cell phones bring the same changes to the people who use them as they have here. We hear and feel the influx of popular music in a land where traditional music is so beautiful.And most of all, we see how the people affected by the future flooding survive, bouncing sometimes numbly from home to shelter as they are evicted from locations with 2,000 years of history.This is a personal film for the director and that too says a lot about the strides the Chinese society has taken since the days of Chairman Mao and even Tiananmen Square.Ever since I figured out the plot line of ""The Sixth Sense"" after five minutes because of giveaways in the trailer, I have resisted them. If I'm in a theater, fine. But I don't go looking for them.DO NOT see the trailer before the film. Three of the very best and most surprising scene are given away in a short, 50-second promo.But do see the film. Very good."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"The movie tells two separate stories of two people. They are both from Shaanxi and take a long way to Fengjie to find their relatives. As they came to Fengjie, a 2000 year old city was going to submerge under water as the great Three Georges Dam was being built. Even though the media always tells great things about the Three Georges Dam, what the audience actually see is a dying town which is being demolished part by part. Along with the city is the destinies of poor people living here. People were forced to relocate and find another place to live and work. The movie is also very successful to depict the miserable living condition of poor people in the region. From here, another aspect of Chinese economic miracle is revealed as poor people find no way to get out of deadly spiral of poverty and have no choice but to move to other places such as Shaanxi to work as coal miners - a job as described in the movie can help them earn more money than their hometown but is also riskier as dozens of people die every year. Another success of the film is the choice of music and songs that were played intermittently during the movie. In particular, the old song ""Seung Hoi Tan"" was used as a ringing tone for the phone of a local worker, perhaps as a reminder of old traditional value. On the other hand, ""Mouse Love Rice"" - a new rising love song at that time was singed passionately by the young kid marking the subtle transform in Chinese culture."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"If you need to name the good things of ""still life"", the first would be probably the clear picture of the lives a portion of China's people. Apart from that, well, I have to admit I'd have a very hard time to mention anything else. ""Still life"" is a very appropriate title, as, on the background of a deeply changing region (and society) nothing happens. Nothing happens in the movie, too, with very slow -well ""still""- sequences that do not manage to communicate anything to the average western viewer.I tend to like ""intellectual"" movies, but while I was in the theater I had the clear impression I was wasting two hour of my life. Actually, two of my friends fell asleep watching it.It may have won the Golden Lion, but that is the ultimate proof that awards do not make a good movie."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Uncertainty is at the stem of Jia Zhangke's ""Still Life"" and it molds itself into many forms - uncertainty as to what China's economic boom holds for its future, displaced people uncertain whether they will ever see those they have lost again, and uncertainty over whether love that is broken can ever be mended. All of this takes place in the backdrop of Fengjie village, which was at the time being upheaved for the construction of Three Gorges Dam (now complete, and the largest electricity-generating plant in the world). Zhangke's use of a real setting and detail provides for some powerful shots, and it's this type of filmmaking that has formed him into one of China's foremost artistic commentators. However, in this movie especially, his cultural scope felt almost more alienating than immersing (one of my major complaints of Apichatpong Weerasethakul's films), enough so to diminish the overall entertainment value."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"This was shot on a most incredible location ever to be filmed at. Which alone could make the film, not just visually, but by its deep surreal meaning - and it did. However, anything director tried to do only clumsily messed it up in several occasions, not showing a feeling for the whole, let alone a command of the film language.Guiding the flow in such slow tempo usually demands absolute scrutiny of every shot, since audience has a lot of time to devote to it. Here I am under impression that there's a lot of ordinary, ballast newscast like footage mixed in with some meaningful and emotional imagery. If realism was the goal, then what's the purpose of 2 isolated appearances of UFOs? (Please!)Film is divided into 4 ""chapters"" (cigarettes, liquor, tea, sweets) - which really don't mark anything in the story flow and are imposed by some packaging obsession. The meaning of these 4 things (explained in an interview) isn't readable not only to most international audience, but, I suspect, even some domestic viewers.All in all, a very powerful location. Too powerful for Zhang Ke Jia's weakness, pretentiousness, and scattered mind not able to put its concepts on screen."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,Two story lines with similarities that end differently. Each story concerns a man and a woman who are looking for their estranged partner in an area of China that is being demolished and is due to be flooded as part of a dam building program. Clearly change is inevitable but what will the outcomes be. One couple haven't seen each other for 2 years and decide to divorce. The other couple have previously divorced but decide to remarry.A realist film with occasionally surreal moments. The drama unfolds slowly with lingering shots of the everyday events from that region of China.Interesting but not riveting.
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Don't believe all the hype. This movie is nothing but a bad amateur film.First the good part. This film does give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Chinese citizens who are living at the bottom of the social ladder. Many contemporary films out of mainland China do no show you this aspect of modern Chinese society. So kudos to the director for bringing this to light.Now the bad parts. The story is non existent, the script is hollow, the acting is wooden. This whole film is a mess. The two main stories of the film have nothing to do with the mass migration of people out of that city that is about to be flooded because of the building of Three Gorges Dam.The first story is about a man from a remote mountain village located in a another province who comes to the city looking for his wife. The man bought his wife from human traffickers 16 years ago. The had a daughter together. After the authorities discovered it, the wife and the daughter returned to her native city, and the man remained in his mountain village. Now 16 years later, out of the blue, the man storms out of nowhere and wants to be reunited with his wife and daughter. For crying out loud, are we supposed to have sympathy for this man, for modern day slave trading, or for the supposed emotional bondage that could have developed between a slave owner and his slave? This story arc is more suited to a film about human trafficking than about the mass migration caused by the building of the Three Gorges Dam.The second story is even more ridiculous. This time a married couple from a different province in China, the man came to this city 2 years ago because of job prospects in demolishing buildings, and the wife stayed behind. Now 2 years later, both the wife and the husband developed extra marital affairs and want a divorce. Again what does this story arc have to do with the mass migration caused by the building of the Dam? The building of the dam is hardly the cause behind the separation of the husband the wife. If the script writer wants to blame anyone/anything for this marital discord, he should place the blame on the fragility of long distance relationships.The worst part about this film is the atrocious acting. None of the protagonists know how to act, period! It's like the director just randomly plucked people off the streets and asked them to pose in front of the camera. Throughout the film, from the minor characters to the protagonists, all the acting was wooden, stiff and emotionless. It was truly painful having sit there for almost 2 hours and being forced to watch all the sub-amateurish acting."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"'Still Life' was the 2006 Venice Film Festival Golden Lion winner, but it's taken a while for it to be released here in the states. It is an enlightening depiction of life in a rapidly developing China, following the lives of a man and woman searching for their lost spouses in Fengjie, a town that is about to be wiped out by the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the recently completed, and now, largest hydroelectric dam in the world. It effectively depicts with its nonprofessional cast a microcosm of the social effects of the rapid economic and environmental changes underway right now in China. If you need a break from the pageantry and spectacle of Zhang Yimou-type Chinese films, this poetic film will be right up your alley."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I knew little about the work of director Jia Zhang Ke, and Still Life (or The Good People of the Three Gorges) provides me with an excellent introduction to his work.Several films have been done to depict the changes, to the lives of many residents, associated with the Three Gorges project. Still Life is one of them but also uses this backdrop to tell two stories of man-women relationship, its disintegration and possible reconciliation.The movie is slow moving, but at a pace relevant to the sentiment being conveyed. The camera work is great. Acting, most likely by non-professional actors, was solid.I was in the Three Gorges area some 10 years ago before the commencement of the Project, and could relate to the scenery and people in that area. The film was done without excessive sentiment, and director Jia took his time to tell the stories in an unpretentious and yet elaborate fashion.I highly recommend the film, and will seek out Jia's work in the future."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Film: Still Life (2006) Director: Jia ZhangkeStill Life takes place in the decaying village of Fengje, which is the in the process of demolition in order to make way for the Three Gorges Dam. The film is a rather gripping and real look at modern China, with it being entirely filmed on stunning high definition digital video. Awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in its year of release, Still Life is an exceptional display of modernistic China and is well deserving of its praise by critics.What's interesting about the plot is that there a two stories being told here. Although not necessarily connected to each other, they both take place in Fengje - The first following a coal miner named Han Sanming (interestingly enough, is the same name as the actor himself), who has traveled to Fengje in order to search for his wife and daughter after they ran away sixteen years ago. Despite Han having only played minor roles in Jia Zhangke's previous works, he delivers a leading role incredibly well in this film to the point where it almost looks like he's simply being himself. There is a feeling of distraught from his character that you really begin to see in the earlier scenes of the film as assumptions could have been made about people he meets, though we soon learn that he is able to handle himself well once he settles himself into a nearby hotel. The second tells the story of a nurse named Shen Hong, who is searching for her husband Guo Bin, having not heard from him for over two years. During her search she befriends Wang Dongming, who assists her in looking for him. Shen is played by the beautiful Zhao Tao who also has played leading roles many of Jia's other films, I found her performance here to be also well done as she has a lot of prior experience working with Jia on his films. The two protagonists share the story of a lost love, but in some cases shows very clear contrasts of one another – Han obviously being of the lower working class earning 50 yuan per day for demolition work, where as Shen looks fit for a much more modern society - also tied into a relationship within a much higher class. The biggest aspect of the film is the visual style, which I thought was remarkable. With it being shot in high definition everything looks visually impressive and is quickly apparent that this is what Jia wanted to be of the most importance in the film. Everything from the sweat and strain on the demolition workers as they are busy with deconstruction to the various shots of the crumbling buildings in Fengje. Jia's other works have had a tendency to use slow, panning camera-work in many of his other films and here in Still Life it is ever so common as there are very many scenes that slowly pan across the huge amount of rubble and men at work. Often they are accompanied without music but rather the distinct working sounds of the demolition which at some stages I felt like it was almost in a rhythmic fashion. Many shots contrast the torn down landscape in comparison to the natural environment, as well as moments when the camera is left lingering for us to observe so much of what is happening, enough to say that through the camera-work alone we can see that these people are left behind in a state of China that is slowly modernizing. Still Life constantly tells of a bigger picture in urban China as the characters are left to make decisions with their love life and choose how to move on in the ever developing society.Although the film does feel slow paced at times, Still Life delivers a visually breathtaking look into urban China. By making use of the Three Gorges Dam project used it cleverly shows us the major changes happening not only in the landscape, but the people as well."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"I watched this movie at Stockholm filmfestival. I had great expectations about it, since it had surprisingly own in Venice, and because of some very enthusiastic comments I read here. Unfortunately I left the movie very disappointed!OK, we find great landscapes in the movie and it gives a vision of the social drama that people moving due to the new dam are facing, but...What about a good script, good actors and dialogs!? And then, the annoying perfect pictures: digital recording...It would have been a great documentary, but please do not call this a movie and, specially, not a great movie.Give it 4 mainly for the landscapes."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"Still Life is not your average movie. I understood this fact about the movie in the first 3-4 minutes when the camera panned giving us the view of people on a ship playing and chatting - ordinary people. Yes. This is what Still Life is all about - Ordinary Chinese People. The film is a glimpse into their lives, how they struggle against mass displacement with the construction of the Three Gorges dam.At first, I was looking for some 'plot' - this movies offers none of that. I wanted to find such a plot in the first half hour of the film, i did not get it (which slightly ruined my interpretation of this work). It does not set out to tell the viewer a story. It sets out to show us how Chinese people are effected by such a massive project, how their relationships get demolished and how relationships get formed as previous relationships get broken. It is something that ordinary cinema can not offer. Be prepared.And as a final note: Don't expect a story to be laid out before you. This is as artsy as a movie can get - it simply lays out a picture before you. It is you, the viewer who has to form your own interpretation of this beautiful work."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"The film is shot in and around Fengjie, a town in Sichuan Province upstream from the 3 Gorges Dam Project and due to be flooded. The existing town was being demolished and the people relocated to ""new Fengjie"". The landscape of the river and the Gorges dominate the filmThe film follows 2 stories. Sanming is a coal miner from Shanxi who comes to Fengjie to try to find his ex wife who ran away 16 years previously. He wants to meet their daughter. He locates her brother on a ship in Fengjie who advises him to wait until his wife's ship returns. He joins a gang of labourers demolishing buildings and lives in a boarding house while waiting for his ex wife.Shen Hong is a nurse whose is trying to track down her husband Guo Bin who came to Fengjie 2 years ago. She has someone else in her life now and tracks down Guo Bin through his friend Wang Dongming so she can persuade him to divorce her. These stories run in parallel with each other but the characters never meet.The photography and the pace of the film make the viewer slow down and look for details as the camera unhurriedly pans across a vast landscape. The view is of the river dominated by precipitous hills, with the blocky concrete shapes of modern housing clinging to the slopes. In the context of the Three Gorges Dam project, a vast undertaking affecting millions of people, so the camera captures the vastness of the landscape that humans are struggling to tame. The landscape is a constant and oppressive presence that refuses to go away. The river flows on regardless of what people do.The characters are frequently filmed simply in front of the camera with the view of river and hills in the background maintaining the feeling of the vastness of nature and the smallness of people, reminiscent of the style of traditional Chinese ink painting.When scenes change away from landscapes, the people are framed up in the empty windows of abandoned houses, overlooking demolished buildings, or up against piles of rubble. The chaos of demolition contrasts with the efforts of the people to maintain the routines of their lives, eating, working, sleeping, socializing. The camera in its slow long takes of people looks for details in their lives. These are not heavily made up characters, in fact they are shown just as they are with the rough hewn physiques of manual labourers, bad teeth, scars from the school of hard knocks. The camera lingers like an observer on individuals, allowing the audience time to get to know them and their mannerisms.The dialogue between the personalities is sparse and reticent, with long pauses in which all the unspoken questions are aired and acknowledged. An example of this is the conversation between Sanming and Missy Ma when they meet after 16 years of separation. In this brief exchange this couple find they still have a future together. The undercurrent in these conversations is like the undercurrent of the river, hidden but acknowledged and always moving on. Further on in a scene in a derelict building Ma offers Sanming a White Rabbit toffee which he accepts bites in two and share it with her. With this simple gesture they agree to reactivate their relationship. As they do, suddenly a tall building in the far background is blown up and collapses, suggesting the end of the old and the potential for a new start.The soundtrack compliments the film and provides reminders of themes. A traditional song plays as the tourist ships moves up through the Gorges but it is interspersed with the sounds of demolition. The background to the characters is punctuated by horn blasts from ferries and ships moving out, a scene of labourers hammering down walls has a soundtrack of machinery overlaid onto it. The soundtrack maintains the pace of the film giving the audience a feeling of relentless movement, of the progress of events. In the interaction between the couples, romantic music is heard.The film is rich in symbolism. The characters for liquor, tea, cigarettes, and toffee appear at critical junctions and mirror traditional Chinese elements of life like rice, cooking oil, fuel and salt. Attributed to ""Chinese Wasteland"" by Shelley Kraicer http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs29/feat_kraicer_still.html accessed 07/09/2010There is a scene where Shen Hong walks past men are rhythmically hammering to no purpose at an abandoned industrial plant. Both Sanming and Shen Hong in their quest for resolutions to their respective relationship problems encounter a young boy wandering aimlessly singing a romantic songThe director wanders into the surreal at times, with the appearance of a UFO streaking across the sky behind Shen Hong. In the restaurant where Sanming waits for his friend, there is the incongruous sight of actors in full Chinese Opera costumes playing Nintendo games The strange building Hong can see from Wang Dongming's apartment, suddenly becomes a rocket ship and blasts off when she turns away, and, at the end of the film as Sanming and his friends are leaving, he turns and sees the incongruous sight of a high wire artist walking a wire strung between two buildings in the process of demolition.Dominant impressions I got from this film were a sense of the vastness of China and Chinese society, the smallness of the humans on the landscape, the relative insignificance of their hopes and dreams. Progress seems like a juggernaut, relentlessly moving onward, pushing aside the people and their hopes for a good life. The river serves as a metaphor for progress. The illuminating factor is the quiet courage of the people as they deal with the circumstances they have to live with, and despite these adverse times push on with their efforts to have a good life."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"SXHR is a demonstration of Jia's skills, from the construction of scenes, supporting sound effects. The reality is properly reflected but noise and distraction are also eliminated. What's more, he has a clear control over the whole thread. Though the plot is carried out in strict time order without many postmodern sequencing tricks, it feels comfortable and natural. Not big story but various interactions, conflicts and contracts can be seen in subtleties. This reminds me of the classic ""Godfather"".Many renowned Chinese directors have grown old and lost the passions seen in their early works. This is inevitable given their ages and change of living environments. Luckily the young generation has taken over. China is changing every second and that should be the ground for great movies."
三峡好人,Still Life (2006),,2006,2008.01.13,"It was the first time of Jia Zhangke to visit three gorges dam, and meantime he was filming about his artist friend, Liu Xiaodong painting the portrait of demolition worker in Si Chuang, Feng Jie. The year of 2006, the monstrous project, three gorges dam was built up on Yangtze River, and the public attention was staying on the side of how will bring the interest to offspring. Nevertheless, behind the national glory, the project itself still remains controversies and generated a group of immigrants called three gorges immigrants who originally lived in the town near the dam that government forced them to move away. Feng Jie is the one of the little town on Yangtze River surrounded by mountains that had to be demolished. The male protagonist, Han was the mining labor in Shanxi, now coming to Feng Jie to seek for his escaped wife and child. Doubtlessly Han was the common figure as a migrant worker in china, and a witness of the transitional life of locals. On the cruise, Han was sitting among workers that the camera captured their indifferent expression while they were looking out toward Yangtze River. Han was one of them, a poor worker who many years ago brought his wife, after having a kid his wife ran away from Shanxi. Feng Jie was alike the ruins of Pompey. At the moment of Han holding the old address of his wife, he was staring blankly to the river. The old town already buried under the water. It is the first hint of transition on the riverside. The nurse, Sheng Hong is an outsider akin to Han, looking for the reunion with his husband. Two years ago, his husband came to Feng Jie working as the manager of demolition and had an affair with a woman. Along the riverside, eventually her husband met and asked Sheng to dance. She left Feng Jie, and divorced without blaming on her husband. There are more symbolized scenes, like the death of the local ambitious and naive young man, and Han and his wife watching the building collapsing as if the end of the world comes. When Jia interpreted his movie, he said, ""As tourists here, we still can see the remaining sight of green mountains and moving rivers. Though if reached the land, walked past the street, and entered into families in vicinity, you will grasp there was a bunch of people living in modernity, but remained such poverty. Over one million immigrants had to leave their own land, and two thousands year town was demolished instantly. It seems irrelevant to us as tourists, but at the bottom of our hearts we also suffered what the locals suffered by dramatic transition on life within these years."""
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"This movie is more meaningful when viewed as a semi-documentary. Through the micro angle of a slightly dramatized story of Tuya, we are introduced to the macro reality of the harsh livelihood of the backward areas of Mongolia and, although not specifically addressed, of many parts of China.Tuya's predicaments are by no means unique, or even unusual, for there are many areas in the mainland where natural resources that we in modern cities take for granted are luxuries. With her husband paralyzed as a result of attempts to drill wells for water, Tuya, relatively young, reasonably good looking and unquestionably able-bodied, takes up the burden of rearing a herd if lambs and caring for her husband and two children. The son, just about turning teen, is a help but the daughter is small. When the burden comes close to being unbearable, the couple resorts to what a lot of people in similarly locations under similar situations do. The have a divorce, and the wife looks for an opportunity for re-marrying, to a man capable of taking care of the children. In Tuya's case, there is another condition: the suitor must undertake to take in the paralyzed ex-husband.The story, as the title suggests, revolves around the events leading to Tuya's marriage, or re-marriage. The events unfold in as natural a manner as can be presented in a movie. There are moments of both farce and pathos, but none is contrived. You can believe that this is exactly the way things would happen. YU Nan who plays Tuya is a marvelous actress. All the other key characters are real local people, using their real names in the movie, but I am not sure whether they are indeed acting out their own story.""Tuya' marriage"" won the Golden Berlin Bear earlier this year, a last-minute entry in the competition and a surprise winner."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"This is an exotic film that recalls other indigenous Mongolian tales by Byambasuren Davaa such as The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003) or The Cave of the Yellow Dog (2005). It also has much in common with the Tibetan film Himalaya (1999) and rural Iranian cinema. The story, like that in each of these other films, is very simple - a woman's husband is incapacitated and she seeks a new man who will support the old.The cinematography is beautiful with the harshness of the inner Mongolian landscape captured aesthetically. Dialogue is sparse, and the film is very observational, documenting a way of life that is gradually receding into the past. The herding and riding of animals, the digging of wells, the visits from potential suitors and other aspects of rural life are nicely captured, and contrast against the oncoming tide of modernity.Thematically, the film has more in common with Breaking the Waves (1996), my favourite Lars von Trier film. There is both humour and heartbreak as the story unfolds. I didn't find the film quite as effective as Weeping Camel but a nice bit of cultural diversity that's worth seeing."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Wang Quanan's fascinating film ""Tuya's Marriage"" is a quietly powerful story of female reverence, shot on location against the arresting landscapes of deepest Mongolia, with its immensely graceful protagonist being the prepossessing shepherdess Tuya (Nan Yu), caught between a marital loophole and the tightening grip of subsistence when she's forced to look for a new husband willing to take care of her young children and an invalid ex-husband. Austere and gorgeous, Wang's observations on the encroaching capitalism in a rural land so entrenched in tradition and its collective, scuttles from background to foreground when Tuya explores her options and their economic viability. Wisely eschewing a formal romanticism of the arena, Wang takes us deeper into the all-encompassing humanism of the film, when he chooses a cogitative docu-drama approach to the film, a striking reminder that a film's aesthetics are part of its ethos and message. Triumphing at the 2007 Berlinale with the festival's top prize, Wang delivers a film so complex and rich that it finds its tracts in the human capacity for compassion and sorrow."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"One of he most interesting films from chines mainland. There are no stunt fights, no killings. This is a human story with human complexities and how a strong woman tries to solve her problem. He enduring love and affections for her disabled husband and her children constitute the main theme. In the background there is another actor, THE LANDSCAPE. Even though the steppe land with brushes and those mountains are harsh to the inhabitants, on screen it looks breathtaking. The film shows how women were doing back-breaking chores(literally in this case) for ages for which man has to be thankful and gracious to her. An absorbing film to watch."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Any film that offers an open window into viewing other culture is always greeted with open arms (at least for me,anyway). 'Tuya's Marriage' is a tale that is set in Inner Mongolia about a thirty something woman named Tuya who is trying to get by,day for day with an older,disabled husband & young children. An opportunity arises for Tuya to make life a little better by getting re-married to a younger man,who (hopefully)would support her meager family. Trouble is,her choices are one disaster after another (including a wealthy suitor who fancied her in middle school). This film, although lushly photographed, seems to be stuck between wanting to be a black comedy, or an exercise in Asian existentialism. Still, the (mostly)non professional cast seems to play their roles well. This film is still worth checking out,none the less."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"I just finished watching Tuya's marriage at the Berlin Film Festival and would rate it 8/10. The movie deals with a herder woman in Inner Mongolia who decides to divorce because her husband is sick and unable to care for her and the family. Since she still loves him, any prospective new husband must promise to care for her and the kids as well as for her old husband.The plot may sound a bit constructed, but it actually works remarkably well. The pictures are great, and after D. Byambasuren's rather static movies this is finally a drama set in the steppes. The most important thing is probably that the movie takes its subjects seriously. Maybe a bit too seriously at times, but not that seriously that it disturbs the movie.So, why not giving it 10/10? I missed the Mongolian language. Of course language isn't everything (see Mongolian Pingpong or Apocalypto), but when even the drinking habits are dealt with in greatest detail, why didn't they bother to find a cast that can speak Mongolian? I asked the director about why they used Chinese (that's what you go on film festivals for), but his answer was not really convincing. I suppose some opportunistic reason, like the main actress can't speak Mongolian. Anyway, this only means that you can as well enjoy this movie in a dubbed version.In short: Definitely recommended."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Unlike the two faux documentaries which people now associate with Mongolian films, TUYA'S MARRIAGE is a well-acted, intricate and layered story about a strong young woman trying to hold her life together. Very like Gong Li in THE STORY OF QIU JU, Yu Nan plays Tuya, a stubborn and beautiful woman faced with an impossible predicament who must find her way through an onslaught of well-meaning (mostly) but ineffectual men to keep her family together. Tuya's affection for and loyalties to her disabled husband Bater are put to the test when she is forced to find a new husband in order to survive. All along the ""obvious"" choice, Shenge, her foolish but adorable neighbor, keeps trying to be the hero but falling on his face. Tuya must keep saving the men in her life from near disaster: Bater, Shenge (twice), and even her young son. The film becomes the romance/triangle of one woman and two men - much like JULES AND JIM or even FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE (co-written by Wei Lu, who also co-wrote TUYA'S MARRIAGE). At the end of the film, her marriage includes both men, but immediately we see that she must continue saving them from themselves - and keeping everything and everybody together."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Tuya' marriage is among one of the most successful attempts by China's sixth-generation directors to make a good film. Other equally successful ones included the Beijing Bicycle, the Little Red Flowers, etc, which were all made by film directors not quite familiar to Western viewers --- at least not as known as big names like Zhang Yimou. The film is so real to life and depicts the life on the vast lands of Inner Mongolia so well, that it reminds me of my piecemeal impressions gathered during my trip to Inner Mongolia six years ago --- people were impoverished but so kind, materially backward but spiritually advanced, and the traditional way of life is preserved well. Yu Nan's performance is really amazing. The plot is so moving and touching that at some points I felt so much involved as to worry about Sengge's death through drilling. This is a new kind of experience even for Han Chinese to learn about the Mongolian life, and I hope it can be the same kind of revealing experience for audience in the West to understand the ethnic diversity in China --- Mongolians live harmoniously with Han Chinese in the same country called ""China"", just as it is the case with the other 55 minorities, including Tibetans.In a nutshell --- Tuya's Marriage indeed deserves the Golden Bear at Berlinale, be it in essence or in name."

图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"An unexpected gem in the middle of the desert, this quiet drama proves itself fully deserving of its Golden Bear at the 2007 Berlin annual film festival.Sixth generation, Mainland Chinese film director Wang Quanan once again bands with actor, and ex-partner of ten years, Nan Yu, to turn his attention to the rural side of life in China- a focal point of his 2004 film The Story of Ermei, which told the story of a young Shaanxi peasant girl. This time 'Tuya's Marriage' takes us into the depths of the vast and arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Though its plot is fairly straight forward, and dialogue simple, this quiet and understated film stands strong in its realistic portrayal of rural life, natural acting style, and breath taking landscape. Her husband crippled after digging a well, strong and persevering Tuya must labour, herding sheep and lugging water from a faraway waterhole, to keep her husband and two young children alive. But the young, and still beautiful Tuya can no longer be the sole carrier of her family's burden- she is suffering from lumbar fatigue caused by over exhaustion, and faces possible lower body paralysis. Her husband agrees that she must find a new suitor to marry. This doesn't prove to be so easy though, as Tuya, still faithful to her old husband, is resolute that whoever wishes to marry her must also be prepared to care for him too. Mainland Chinese born actor Nan Yu is well fitted in her role as the independent Tuya. The fact that Nan Yu spent several months living in rural Mongolia prior to filming has given her a great understanding and confidence in the role and comes off as a genuine Inner Mongolian grasslands shepherdess. Tuya's costume potentially could have swallowed many actors whole- she is swathed in numerous, bulky layers of clothing and wrapped tightly in a head scarf- but Nan Yu's expressive face works to bring Tuya to life. Tuya is an independent, incredibly strong woman. She is a shepard to the men around her- her disabled husband Baotoer, her likable but foolish friend Shenge who always falls on bad luck, and even her younger son. She has an incredibly strong loyalty towards her husband ""The only way I'd leave him is if I became worse than him"" and for his sake turns down many suitors who could have been a way out of poverty for her. But there are a few times when we get to see another side of Tuya's tough exterior. My favourite scene is when we see her, taken away from the farm and work, sitting together with her friend Shenge in his brand new truck. Orange light shines on them from the setting sun, and as they look forward into the distance Shenge speaks of the uncertainties of the future. For a moment we see a fragile young woman, no different from ourselves, who is lost in a big, and changing world.If Nan Yu is the star of the movie, then the landscape would have to be her co-star. Absolutely stunning with it's never ending, barren desert and clear blue skies, the long shots show the vastness of the land and isolation of the characters. The women in the film wear brightly coloured head scarves- pink, red, purple, green- as a way of expressing them selves, and these headscarves are a striking contrast against the often dust coloured backdrop.The use of music in this film is also truly effective. Traditional string instruments are often used, along with woman singing. The music is only used at the saddest times in the film, and is combined with long, enduring shots of the wild and desolate landscape. This creates a haunting feeling of loneliness and forlornness. Both landscape and music become symbolic of Tuya's situation- she is stranded with no solution in sight. Tuya's Marriage generally fits into the drama genre. The film deals with realistic and totally believable characters, and explores how social issues such as poverty and alcoholism bring these characters into conflict with themselves, and the others around them. Poverty makes rural farm life in China tough, and relatively simple tasks such as watering the sheep become difficult because lack of adequate equipment- Tuya must travel 30miles a day just to fetch sufficient water. The question of day to day survival forces characters to make decisions that go against every part of their being-it becomes a cruelly ironic when the only way for Tuya to care for her disabled husband, Baotoer, who she loves, is to divorce him. Several of the characters look to alcohol to numb the pain. An older chain-smoking woman, worn out by life's trials, says ""I'm raising six by myself with no man; if I didn't drink I don't know what I'd do."" In a sense Tuya's Marriage also becomes a documentary of Mongolian culture and traditional ceremonies, often putting a lot of focus on the landscape, the traditional ceremonies and dress, the music, and traditional foods such as head-to-tail lamb and milk tea. This makes the film a fascinating experience, but my only possible complaint is that this overtakes the films over focus on showing intimate interactions between the characters. Beautiful and affecting, and often scattered with moments of humour and tenderness, Tuya's Wedding gives us a window into a seldom travelled world through the struggles of one young woman."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"I liked this movie. The story is interesting, woman-centered, Yu Nan's acting is excellent, the social commentary is interesting, the non urban setting is a refreshing change from the usual stuff, without making a travel guide of the film at all. It also combines drama and humor in a nice way. It doesn't become melodramatic, thank God. The end of the story is poised between happy and sad, which is how life is in the majority of the cases. Now, some specific negative points:I would prefer the film to be in the Mongolian language, too.The family looks very poor, they only have a small herd of sheep, yet they own a camel, a horse and a donkey. I'm not an expert on this, but it looks as too much to me, compared with the number of the income-generating sheep.The scene where Shenge catches up with the Mercedes on the highway by riding on a horse is absurd. What's more, Shenge didn't even know the whereabouts of Tuya and her prospective husband at that moment.When Tuya, Shenge, Maoter and the kids return home from the above failed matching, Tuya starts again herding her sheep and all. But, since they had previously left their home supposedly forever, they should have sold everything: sheep, camel, house, etc. So that's absurd too.At the final wedding scene, it's impossible that Maoter (the ex-husband) would disrupt the proper procedure of the ceremony by starting to sing his own tune. Why? Well, because, first, he himself had prodded Tuya since the beginning to find a new husband; second, he later actively approved of this specific husband, namely Shenge; third, earlier in the film this Shenge had practically saved his life after his suicide attempt in the asylum, and then he had even brought his wife back. And Maoter is a very good, quiet, logical person. So his reaction is illogical and unbelievable, even allowing for the effect of the additional cup of alcohol : too much is at stake. The screenwriters should have found here another idea to convey their message that even after this happy ending life will not be cloudless within the new household. Tuya's boy fighting with a neighbor boy because the latter scolded him for having ""two fathers"" is, on the contrary, a much more successful idea that serves the same purpose."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Just when the audience decided to sit back and relax to enjoy a plain, slow moving film shot in the Mogolian steppe, they found themselves grabbed by the unexpected twists and turns as the story unfolded.Tuya was in great trouble. She hurt her back trying to save her neighbor. She had to look for a man to carry on with the work in the farm as her husband, Barter, was crippled. Suitors, including a high school secret admirer, flocked at her doorstep and she was not keen on any of them.Tuya was about to resign to fate, when she found true love and solutions to her problems. The first scene was an exact duplicate of the last. Tuya shut herself up to weep, but then her new husband called her. She had to get out to face new challenges in her new life.The exotic Mongolian music, both the singing and the instrumentals, and the shots of the grand steppe, distant mountains and the over hanging full moon added distinct flavor to the movie.The plot somehow reminded me of Hardy's ""Far From the Madding Crowd"". The one was the one nearest to you and the one you had written off completely in the first place."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Though some may consider Tuya's Marriage as an art film, it is more like a depiction of the society in inner-Mongolia, China. Based on the amount of Chinese literary and film works, the story itself of a woman marrying another man to support her Ex is not uncommon in the more aboriginal areas in China. But the way this picture filmed Tuya's story: Tuya's camel compared to Sen'ge's motorcycle and truck, and the rich suitor's Benz; and the trip from the desert to the hotel closer to the city, viewers can see what China is really like now.I believe that besides telling Tuya's story (which is based on an actual story), the director also wants to show viewers how the semi-modern Chinese society works, and how it has an impact on the lives of people living in different parts of China. Tradition and landscape really isn't the point in this movie, there are many details in here regarding to the characters' daily lives that viewers can compare to themselves, which I believe would be interesting to do. Take myself for example, I live right across the strait from mainland China and I could never imagine myself leading a life in inner-Mongolia like Tuya."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"The new generation of Chinese cineasts (the sixth, have I been told) tries to develop more personal projects than the previous one, by making movies that carry a individual story more than a collective one. Wang Quanan, with ""Tuya"", represents this new generation of Chinese directors, and tells in this movie a personal and individual story (his mother comes from the Mongolian area the film depicts) without trying to link it to the Chinese history, but he also creates a bridge with the previous one (his character of a strong woman reminds the portrayals that Gong Li has done with Zhang Yimou). But, unfortunately, the movie doesn't have the same originality of, for instance, his friend Jia Zhan-Ke's, nor doesn't manage to carry the same strength than Zhang Yimou's.The story is like the movie, simple and a little bit plain : in a lost farm in Inner Mongolia (but still in China) Tuya has to find a new husband since her present one is unable to work. But she asks one condition to accept the new pretendant : he has to supplies for her ex-husband needs. But the movie seems to film the quest of Tuya like a pretext to show the beautiful landscapes of the area, the traditions that seem to survive here (as the marriage scene nicely shows it), an also typical Mongolian clothes, rituals and music. It's sure pretty and interesting, but more like a travel guide documentary than like a modern Chinese cinema piece of art.Beside one or two good cinematographic interesting ideas (especially located at the very beginning and at the end of the movie ; and a good scene that show a woman crying at her wedding), there's nothing really passionating nor new there. Of course, cinema can sometimes be considered like a traveling substitute, but it also needs to be something more if the spectator really wants to enjoy the traveling."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Tuya's marriage is a truly remarkable film showing the family changes and humanity of a Mongolian herds-family, The main actress plays the role of an incredible strong woman named Tuya. The liberal way of thinking of these Mongolian people can be a lesson to folks here in the west. Tuya's disabled husband even encourages her to separate from him because it's best for the family.Tuya however only wants to remarry if her ex husband will be accepted as a family member by her new husband. we follow Tuya on her way towards a new life with several would be-new husbands.a film full of love and caring of a people who live in two worlds , ancient way's of living and modernity. fascinating film and story."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Tuya's Marriage is very interesting, as it looks at the life of Mongolian life in today's lifestyle. The story started with the ending, and then they all started to tell the beginning. I do not know much about the Mongolian lifestyle, but it seems like a very rural experience, that is met by the need for water. The main character, Tuya, is a herder of sheep, and they sell the sheep to make their money. One problem the family has is there is never any water around them, so they need to go and get it with their camel. That is quite the nuisance as they have to only use a certain amount, and once they are out they have to go and get more water. To solve this problem her first husband tried to build a well outside of the house, yet injures himself throughout the process. The well is not finished, and now Tuya has to do all of the work and take care of her two kids and her husband, as he is crippled now and can not work. Tuya goes and finds many suitors, once she finds the first one, it does not go well. The next suitor is named Shenge, and is very close with the family, as he tries to build a well outside of the house too. I will not get into too much detail, as you should see the movie to find out, but then it ends with no one knowing who Tuya really marries. It is the day of her wedding, and her first husband gets in a fight with Shenge and no one truly knows who she marries. I believe she marries Shenge, but no one knows for sure. I would recommend seeing this movie to someone if they are interested in the rural life of Mongolians."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Before viewing this film, I was very unfamiliar with Mongolian culture. I had always imagined the Mongolian people as a nomadic group who only lived in tents and constantly from place to place in large groups. It had never occurred to me that there were many Mongolians who did live in a stable place in homes. This movie definitely opened my eyes to that. It also made me think about the various issues that people face in different regions of the world. Tuya's issue was that her husband was crippled and she was at risk of becoming crippled so she needed to marry another man in order to support her family; however, this proved to be very emotional for Tuya and her husband, Bater. It was a slower paced movie but the visuals were very beautiful and intriguing. The director did a good job of portraying the landscape of Mongolia and setting up the scene so the viewer got a sense of the typical way of life in Mongolia. Overall I would give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"I feel as though this movie is boring to watch if you want to watch a good movie, but it would be good if viewed as a documentary about Mongolian life. Nothing that happens in this movie is particularly interesting, but it does give you an opportunity to learn about Mongolian life, as well as the role that women play in society. This movie was heavily based around a nomadic Mongolian lifestyle, and showed the struggles that a woman like Tuya faced. Since Tuya's husband was disabled, she had to do most of the work around the house and with the livestock. This movie to me was fairly boring, but I found the aspects of Mongolian life fairly interesting to learn about. Overall I found this movie fairly enjoyable from a documentary aspect, but as a film it was fairly boring with bad acting. I would recommend this movie to somebody who wants to learn about Mongolia."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Overall I did not like this film too much. It reminded a lot of a film we watched in the first semester called Ixcanul, another one I found rather unenteraining. From what I can recall about the first one, both of them were about arranged marriage and both of them had rather little dialogue. They were both pretty quiet films and followed the life of farmers. These films have almost a documentary approach to them. As far as the cinematography goes, they resemble each other a lot in my mind. There were a lot of scenes that were just very zoomed out and captured a lot of the bleak landscape that their countries contained. I can't remember much of the storyline of Ixcanul but this movie similarly followed the life of a female farmer named Tuya. Her husband ha sheen crippled and can't help her support their family. Tuya herself is later injured and is advised to stay away from intense manual labor to avoid further injury. Her husband divorces her and allows her to look for a husband that can surely support everyone in the family. She is caught between two suitors and the movie ends with both of them fighting and her leaving the scene. If I can remember correctly, in Ixcanul, the main character is also injured and later hospitalized. she is stuck with one suitor and is forced to marry him with no choice, whereas Tuya has some freedom in that she can select between two."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Tuya's Marriage was an interesting movie to say the least. It was the first Mongolian film that I had ever seen, and it was also one of the most interesting to say the least. I felt like there was an interesting story behind the movie, but I felt as if the actors and director didn't really as much passion for this. Then again, this is coming from an American perspective rather than someone who is actually Mongolian, so I don't truly know how much they put in to this film. I did enjoy all of the camera angels in the film, as well as the location and props. They did a wonderful job recreating a Mongolian home. I also liked how well they all rode their horses during the film. It was clear that some time and thought was put in to making the actors ride as if they were Mongolian."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"This film was very different than most foreign films that I have seen. At most times during the film I was confused, because it would not really show what actually happened or what the results turned out being. The main character in the film Toya divorces Ba'toer, who then tries to commit suicide. This affects her and her children as well. Toya was in terms of conflict when deciding who her new husband would be. Even though she would be marrying someone else that man would have to promise to look after Ba'toer since he was need for medical care and did not have enough money himself, but many refused to do so. I think Toya wanted the best for Ba'toer after she left him, because he was still an important person to her, but I think she left him for the reason that he didn't have enough money to take care of herself and her children, that is why she goes and seeks for a wealthy man.I did not really like how the movie ended, because it never shows who she ends up being with, and I think this movie would have been better if things were clearer. However, I found it interesting how this film showed life in Mongolia, and this family was not very poor, like seen in most foreign films, they had a lot of animals, and lived in a house. Overall, I did not enjoy this film, as much as I thought I would have. The pacing was really slow, and many aspects of the film to me seemed bad, that is why I would rate this film a 2/5."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"This film was about how the main character, Tuya divorces her husband, Batoer, and is forced to make a better life for herself and kids with a new man. She faces conflict when she is offered a new life from two men who want her: it's either a wealthy old friend who promises to give and pay for anything she needs, or her lonely neighbor who proclaims his ultimate love for her, who has just left his wife. Personally, I did not enjoy this movie one bit. It was slow, confusing and the plot behind it (I found) was plain and silly. If it were not for the fact that this film is Mongolian and the cultural differences, I feel likeI have seen this plot over and over again in many other films. Although it was interesting to see their way of life, I found this film more like a documentary than a movie. I was not impressed by the actors all that much, but I thought the kids were really cute. This film confused me a lot in terms of what was going on, but I noticed there was a lot of alcohol, which surprised me since they seemed to live very naturally and off the land. I also noticed that during the day and while the characters were going about their everyday life, they wore baggy, plain and neutral colored clothing (probably mostly to keep warm)!! The only times they were color were in their headscarves, and during the ceremony at the end! I found this cool, since obviously color and fashion is important to them when going to important events, like it is for us. I wouldn't have guessed them to just all of a sudden dress up in nice colors, fabrics and jewels, since I was so used to seeing at the characters in grays, blacks and browns. At times I felt bad for the animals because they were so heavily depended on, and didn't seem to get much love; but on the other hand, this was their only way of life, and animals are not looked at the way we look at them in the US."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"The film Tuya's Marriage is not a happy one. The movie begins and ends with the same scene of her eventual wedding day, with her youngest son fighting with another boy who sneers at him for having two fathers. Tuya's marriage portrays a world that, apart from its hardship, is thoroughly recognizable. Its characters are motivated by the same needs for companionship and material well-being. And the same wants of greed, lust, jealousy and despair — that drive most people. Tuya, after breaking up the fight, retreats from the celebration to reflect. Tuya (protagonist) is physically disabled and married to and in love with a disabled peasant Ba'toer. Tuya (Yu Nan) is financially forced to divorce him and find a new husband to support herself, her 'ex' husband and their two children. She is called upon by suitors from near and far when word spreads of her decision to remarry. The film observes the fascinating rites of courtship and the unsentimental deal making by Tuya, who knows what she wants and what she has to do to get it. After a series of men refuse to look after Ba'toer, Tuya finds herself torn between a Baolier, a divorced childhood schoolmate of Tuya who is newly wealthy, having struck oil or a friend who promises to marry her once he finds and divorces his wife. Baolier's money and lust may represents the forces of technological change that is consuming the region. In Baolier's marriage proposal he agrees to take care of Bater by putting him in a nursing home, and Tuya agrees. However, it's not a good enough deal for Bater. Soon after arriving at his new him, he starts, feeling abandoned then pitifully gets drunk and slashes his wrists. The ending, like I said is not a happy one. Nonetheless, I'd recommend it to another friend or teacher."

This movie is listed as a romantic comedy, though there was romance, the movie was not that funny. There were only two moments where I might have laughed. On the other hand, the movie does hold my attention so much that I would watch it again. I think watching it again would give me a better understanding of what I have sees and possibly catch more ""funny"" moments.Something I found interesting is how Tuya is able to arrange her own marriage. Usually when you think of an arranged marriage, it is the parents not the persons getting married who sets up the marriage. Not only does she have control of who she marries but she also discusses terms and agreements within the marriage. The ending is also interesting because it is unclear and keeps you guessing. That may be the reason why I or anyone else would want to watch Tuya's Marriage again, to try and find the answers to some unresolved questions."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Tuya's Marriage was, compared to most of the Asian films I've seen, kind of a letdown. I enjoyed it, but although the movie had a good premise, it didn't have high enough stakes or interesting moments to really catch my attention. The plot followed the title character, a shepherd named Tuya, who is married to her husband Batoer. Batoer, who is disabled, is unable to work as a shepherd, and when an injury also leaves Tuya unable to work, she is forced to divorce Batoer and remarry someone who can provide for him. After numerous men refuse to look after him, Tuya is torn between Baolier, a wealthy, recently-divorced man who works for an oil company, and Shenge, her neighbor whose wife has recently left him. Baolier proves to not be as good of a man as he seems, as Batoer tries to commit suicide and Baolier doesn't tell Tuya about it. Shenge also seems to not be who he seems at first, but turns out to have been digging the well as a source of income for Tuya, even if it meant hurting himself in the process. However, the relationship between Shenge and Tuya, instead of easily coming together, was made difficult by Tuya rejecting him, then accepting his advances, then rejecting him again. I feel like it would've had a bit more closure if the audience knew who she decided to marry, but it was never made clear. I'd only give this movie 3 out of 5 stars—it was okay, but it wasn't amazing by any means."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Last week I watched Tuya's Marriage and I was pretty interested in the the movie. I thought it would be a nice change from my normal genre taste and a nice way to see the culture of the Mongolians. After watching it though, I have to say it was such a boring movie that I wanted to fall asleep half way through it. I thought it was very boring and the story line was just very plain and not interesting. The names all sounded the same to me and I just felt that the everyday life of these people was just a giant melting pot of stuff. The thing that makes me the most upset is the ending. Tuya still meets with the suitors and makes a deal even though she knows that Shenge wants to marry her, but at the end of the movie you see Shenge and Tuya's ex husband fighting about the marriage and we never got to know who she was even marrying. This left me in a state of confusion and it just made me dislike the movie more and more. I would not recommend this movie but I guess it is a nice way of seeing life in Mongolia."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"In all honesty, I would not recommend Tuya's Marriage to anyone. The movie is a long, boring, and pointless film. It is bad enough that it has no action or comedy, but when you add in the factors of it being so long, and repetitive, it becomes almost unbearable. All the suitors who hear that Tuya needs another man in her life, have little to offer in the category of love. They don't seem to like Tuya for who she is, it looks like there just there to get a wife. This is really all I have to say about the movie, i don't recommend it."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"In my opinion, I do not believe that Tuya's Marriage is close to the movie I would recommend to everyone. The reason being is that it is slow paced, and does not truly go with any genre that I have dealt with in movies. But, this is why I am so intrigued by it, even though it is slow, it touched on important topics in world geography and people's lives and how they are affected when fate is unkind. I believe that this movie, even though it is not one I would recommend to everyone, is something that truly shows hardships and problems that happen in Inner Mongolia (which is situated in China). This movie does not really fall into a specific genre outside of extreme drama, but it is hard to realize this unless you take time after watching it to ponder the plot and the points made inside it. I think this is a movie more for someone looking to widen their eyes to problems in the world, and that want to understand how it can be in a certain place if tragedy strikes."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"This movie makes me think about myself: compare the living conditions between Mongolia and us, I definitely think I am lucky, and thanks to my family. In Mongolia, the child needs to do a lot of work that I did not even try before, and they are lacking water resource. Also, their transportation is poor. Tuya's Marriage also shows their attitude of living, they do not give up, they still want to stay at their home instead of going to the city. Tuya is a strong woman, his husband is paralytic, so she needs to take care of her family by herself; she goes thousands of miles to get water and depasture sheeps every day, even she has physical problems. She divorced her husband in order to give a better condition to her family, she says everyone wants to marry me needs also need to support her ex-husband. The favorite scene in this movie is her child had been trapped in a wolf attack, she comes and says"" do not worry, if these wolves attack you, I will eat them and leave these sheep here, I am gonna take you home"". On this movie, I see a great mom, wife and a hot heart person."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"I did enjoy some aspects of this movie. It was interesting to see the living conditions of Mongolia and see the farm animals and land. The story was also quite interesting. It intrigued me to see how different marriage was from the norms of the US. It was odd to see how open her current husband was to divorce and having her see other men. It was also interesting to see how men basically had to ""audition"" for the role of her husband. All she wanted was the best for her family, she had really great character, telling her suitors that they would have to help take care of her older ex-husband and not just abandon him behind. She still loves him, despite her getting a divorce from him. It was definitely a very difficult situation. Although the plot was so interesting, the movie was done in a way that made it feel dragged out and maybe even a little boring. Their was some excitement in the plot, but the movie failed to portray it."
图雅的婚事,Tuya's Marriage (2006),,2006,2008.04.04,"Just a beautiful and authentic movie with beautiful scenery of Mongolia, China and gives a good idea of daily life of a different kind in this world. I especially liked the tranquil way it has been shot almost like a documentary style way of filming. Also the actress who plays Tuya in this movie has such a beautiful face that it's even noticeable tightly wrapped in her traditional headscarf. I can't say absolutely nothing negative about this movie. There should be much more movies like this coming out that not only have the ability to entertain you but even make people think about what we think life is really about."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Two's a company and three's a crowd. In movieland, that is almost always true, with no black and white, but with shades of grey instead. Of late, period or martial chivalry movies either look aesthetically beautiful like Zhang Yimou's trilogy of Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower, or opt for the grittier, more down to earth look with plenty of dirt and grime like Battle of Wits. Director Peter Chan's The Warlords follows the latter with its strained colors and muck on everyone's face, in parallel of the grey that befalls everyone in this tale of a trio's struggles with the System, and amongst themselves.Those who are familiar with stories featuring similar themes like brotherly bonds, blood brothers and the likes, will find that The Warlords, when striped away to its core, conforms to the same. But what Peter Chan did, and I thought succeeded, was to fuse really hard core battle action sequences with character driven drama, and having the stellar leads of Andy Lau, Jet Li and Takeshi Kaneshiro play something quite unlike their usual on screen personae, well, except maybe Kaneshiro. Publicity talk has been rife of Jet Li's unbelievable pay package taking up almost 40% of the production cost, but if that was true, I'd guess it must've been a reward to take on something risky (to a screen idol that is), and as it turned out, it could instead be a career defining role for Li, who doesn't get as much opportunity to show off those slick martial arts moves, no doubt in part wanting to stick the movie as close to reality as possible (bye, shawdowless kick!)Li opens the movie as a disgraced general Ma Xin Yi, who was betrayed and only survived a massacre of his troops by the cowardly act of playing dead (Yes! Jet Li, playing a coward, pretending to be dead! Told you!) In his quest to survive incognito, he chances upon a bandit Zhang Wen Xiang, played by Kaneshiro, who acknowledges General Ma's fighting prowess, and recruits him to the gang of Lau's Cao Er-Hu. However, the bandit life is not for a man of war, who sees the poor bandit village getting their arses kicked when soldiers of a rival court raid them, and thus finds the catalyst to encourage the bandit men to draw salary and food, by joining the army. Suspicious and needing assurance of the General, the trio of Ma, Zhang and Cao sign a blood oath, and thus the blood brothers are born - one a charismatic leader, one a general looking to reclaim his honour, and one in every bonding, the earnest and faithful follower.As the story unfolds, you begin to see how de-facto leaders always feel threatened by young upstarts, both in the politics within the small band of brothers, and in the bigger picture with the court officials. With individuals, there's almost always a clash of ideals, with many methods available in achieving common objectives, and one man's insatiable ambition will put the others at risk in Machiavellian terms. Finding themselves stronger in unity, repeated success on the battlefield start to change folks and reveal true intentions. Even the rule of law established becomes subject to interpretation based on the moment's convenience, and core principles like honour and gentlemen's agreement get tossed out of the window. As innermost desires are revealed, you'll begin to see how seriously or not, the blood oath is being treated by each individual, especially when one finds the other being externally threatened, or betrayal of temptation in the highest order courtesy of female lead Xu Jinglei's Lian as the token flower amongst the thorns.However, the story bore strength in its presentation of key moments where you'll be called upon to question and even judge the characters, their decisions, and at times, forced to choose sides. You may be convinced by one argument, yet understand the necessity of why something else was done instead. And I'd think you'll probably won't stick to one side for the most parts, and such bringing out the shades of grey that you'll experience for yourself, if you happen to be in the shoes of the trio's foot soldiers. Naivety is truly unkind, and sometimes one is just a pawn in situations far beyond one's grasp, and you can see how this rings true for almost every character here.While it is easy to dwell on the battle sequences and make this one heck of an action romp in the veins of 300 (ok, so this one had its ""108 heroes"" moment in a nod towards probable upcoming Water Margin movies), which it did look to suspiciously tread along the same vein, I thought the filmmakers here were smart to know when to show gore, with the decapitations, piercings and the likes, to knowing when to retract such in your face moments for maximum effect. In the hands of a lesser director, perhaps a key brutal scene will mean to show the obvious full frontal, but in showing you something else instead, with focus on individual reactions and the reactions of compatriots at one point in time, I thought it achieved a more powerful effect, with the audience I'm with tonight completed dumbfounded and silent throughout the scene.A remake of sorts of Shaw Brothers' Ci Ma some 35 years ago (directed by Chang Cheh and starring David Chiang, Ti Lung and Chen Kuan Tai in the lead roles), Peter Chan has brought to us a worthy Chinese epic movie with lavish production values, and one deserving of being called a magnificent effort. And yes, this deserves a watch in seeing who's actually playing who, and with a stellar cast to boot, I don't see why not. Highly recommended!"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Last night I had the opportunity to view one of the best films i've seen in a very long time. One that stays with you far after the closing credits. One that requires time after viewing to untie all the knots in your stomach.Peter Chan's ""The Warlords"" is a period epic in every sense of the word. Chan covers a lot of ground here depicting war and the consequences thereof consisting of his anti-war sentiments. It tells the story of three ""brothers"" played brilliantly by Jet Li (Fearless), Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs) and Takeshi Kaneshiro (House Of Flying Daggers) who make a pact of brotherhood to one another that consists of killing anyone who harms one of the brothers and killing any brother who harms another brother as they lead an army through war after war taking over city after city.It's incredible to watch the thought process of making vital decisions during a battle or within their own army to defy humanity for the ""greater good"". It shows the internal and external struggle of these decisions by opposing points of view. The emotions felt by these men translate in any language and leave you emotionally drained after watching the film through to its tragic end.The cinematography is outstanding, the budget is huge, the directing brilliant and the war scenes brutal as can be. We're talking decapitations, gushing blood, limbs sliced off and a man being blown up by a cannonball. Chan is delivering a truth in the brutality of war rather than dressing it up to keep (most of it) realistic.War is hell.... and this film will take you there and back. Highest recommendation."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I can certainly respect this Chinese production. After all, the battle sequences are huge, the action very real and the look of the film is top-notch. Yet, despite all this I have a few reservations that keep this from being a truly great film.The first problem is that most non-Chinese will have no idea what's happening much of the time unless they research into the Taiping Rebellion FIRST. While there is a prologue that gives a bit of information, it is very scant--and leaves many, many unanswered questions that you can only understand if you have read up on this era in Chinese history. Some good examples are the significance of the crucifix necklace---the viewer will have no idea where it came from or why it's there. And, who were the rebels and why were they rebelling against the Qing empire? Most importantly, who were the good guys and who weren't? Interestingly enough, who is the hero and villain overall in this rebellion seems to vary over time. During Mao's reign, he felt that the Taiping rebels were the good guys as they represented the forces of socialism (with their redistribution of the land and equality). Today, the prevailing attitude in the country seems to be that the rebels were bad because they brought disunity. ALL of this might have been interesting to learn about in the film, but alas I learned none of this in ""Warlords"".Second, while the battle sequences were amazing and I was glad that they didn't make war seem bloodless (oooh, it's VERY bloody in this film!!), the film occasionally suffered from over-kill, per se. In other words, with so many battles and so much killing, the senses are overloaded and the film manages in spite of all the brutality and severed limbs to actually bore--at least it did do with me.But, despite these serious complaints, I DO recommend you see the film--provided you read up on the facts first. It's a particularly great film to see on the big screen or on a huge plasma TV. And, the plot involving the three blood brothers is pretty interesting and the acting very good. One final important reason to see the film for weirdo purists like me is that you CAN turn off the English-dubbed version and just watch it in Chinese with English subtitles--and I appreciate that option."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"After last years' shallow, garbage extravaganza ""Curse of the golden flower"" that left you with only one thing to remember (the unceremoniously stuffed pseudo generously-endowed bosoms), a war epic that has real substance such as ""Warlords"" is a sheer delight.With the last few years' proliferation of war epics, both on Eastern and Western screens, battle scenes that fall nothing short of stunning the audience has come to be expected or, to put it even more bluntly, taken for granted. ""Warlords"" certainly delivers in that department. But it's the substance that really counts.Throughout the movies, one point has been repeatedly driven home: the gallant (or savage, whichever you prefer) fighting cannot be sustained without army provisions (or food, to be more specific). Strategies, negotiations, treacheries, betrayals in this movie all surround this one vital agenda. And more than that, starvation and poverty extend beyond the military context, to the general populace. The suffering of the helpless, powerless peasants is universal, be it in ""The tale of two cities"" or ""Seven samurais"". The three men in ""Warlords"", blood brothers sworn on an oath of death, all have noble goals of helping to relieve the poor of this fate. But their mentalities are different.General Ma (Jet Li), the only survivor from the massacre of his entire army by the revolutionists seeks refuge with bandit chief Cao (Andy Lau), whom he subsequently convinces to bring the bandit camp to enlist with the government army. Ma is an almost enigmatic character that has a lofty goal but also a dark side. He is ruthless to the point of making you wonder if the price is worth paying. One may even be skeptical about his integrity but the movie seems to tend towards depicting him as more fanatic than evil. And in the end, compared with the evil cunning of those in high places, he is even naïve, as his tragic end clearly shows.Cao is a rough-diamond type of hero who does not have Ma's lofty aspirations but has a dogged loyalty and integrity that you'll be compelled to root for. And yet he is not lily white. As a bandit chief, ravishing the conquered is a most natural part of his life, and he cannot understand why General Ma insists on public execution of his people who molested two girls. ""We do that all the time,"" he protests. Zhang (Takeshi Kaneshiro), Cao's second-in-command seems to be the one best guided by common sense, remaining loyal to Cao and yet supporting Ma's ruthless acts for the good of the big picture. But in the end, he is the most naïve.Director Peter Chan, who has demonstrated his artistry in a variety of genre from tender romance to dazzling musical, has done it again with a stunning war epic. The potential dramatic conflict between the three blood brothers has been crafted into scene after scene of intense emotions that carry conviction. This is Jet Li's most impressive performance in his career to-date. As if to demonstrate once more that an actor is only as good as the director, Andy Lau, who verges on looking like a clown in Zhang Yimou's pretentious ""House of flying daggers"", is a completely reborn actor in ""Warlords"". By comparison Takeshi Kaneshiro's role is less multi-dimensional, and he delivers.This movie can do without a female lead but movie makers have to cater to commercial considerations, I imagine. The result is somewhat of a waste of lovely and talented Xu Jinglei, screen idol of China's university campus population, as well as a director and a screenwriter in her own right. In my view, the unconvincing and underdeveloped romance triangle not only does nothing to help the movie, but even takes away some of the intensity of focus."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"For an international film that came out in 2007, this has to be one of the best cinematographic films I've seen in a while. It felt like it was Hollywood produced and filmed in 4K. Directing was spot-on, and all casting was excellent, including the massive amount of extras. My only issues is the writing; this Chinese historical drama was full of sweeping montages, dramatic battle scenes and rhetorical blood oaths, but its dramatic gravitas was lost amongst a convoluted plot and a very weak love triangle. Nevertheless, it was gratifying and entertaining. A solid 8/10 from me, the majority of my rating for the cinematography."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Looking at the list of writers involved in this project, it is a fraking miracle that this film is as good as it is. While it is no The Banquet, it is a solid historical epic which features the most layered and complex performance of Jet Li's career.Loosely based on the Shaw Brothers' 1973 film The Blood Brothers as well as the life and death of General Ma Xinyi, this is a tragedy in the Greek or Shakespearean sense. Jet Li plays General Pang Qingyun, a general of the Ching army whose command is slaughtered by the Taiping rebels while Pang's allies the Ho Army watch and do nothing.Injured, delirious and with no one left to command, Pang is nursed back to health by a beautiful woman who turns out to be the wife of Andy Lau's bandit leader Zhao Er-Hu. When the Ho Army raids Lau's village, steals their supplies and kills one of his men, Jet Li convinces Er-Hu and his lieutenant Zhang Wen-Xiang (played by Takeshi Kaneshiro) that if they join the Ching Army they will get the respect, money and guns necessary to protect themselves and their village. Pang, Er-Hu and Zhang swear a blood oath to stand together with death as the penalty for oath-breakers.This starts Pang on his quest to save his country from itself, building an army from the unwanted, the poor, the brigands. In the process, Pang must fight Imperial politics as much as the enemy Taiping rebels. Each step along the way, Pang has to barter away a little piece of his soul to achieve victory, with Zhang reacting with hero-worshipping approval, while Er-Hu becomes increasingly disgusted.The down side to working with a star of Jet Li's caliber is that in every role he is Jet Li, bringing with it his quiet heroism and idealism. This film turns that drawback into an advantage by casting Jet Li as a man who does increasingly villainous things for the purest of motives. Like a Chinese Robespierre, Pang is trying to build a free, united China on a pyramid of corpses.The film that The Warlords reminds me of the most is John Ford's The Searchers.Like The Searchers, The Warlords starts with a massacre. Both films feature characters who leave their homes on an obsessive quest that seems impossible and takes them years to complete.John Ford uses John Wayne's iconic, heroic status and subverts it, as the obsessive quest slowly destroys Wayne from within. Jet Li's character in The Warlords follows the same arc, beginning his quest with idealistic purity and finishing just inches from total madness. Both men succeed in their quests, Jet Li's Pang in saving his country, Wayne's Ethan Edwards in rescuing his niece, but in both cases their quest is ultimately futile, because what they saved was the reality and what they wanted to save was an ideal. Both men end their films framed in a doorway that they can no longer cross, because their journeys have turned them into men of war who have no place in the world of peace on the other side of the doorway."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I read all the reviews here (there are only 21 by this time)and there were just 2 reviews that didn't come from Asia. Here is a third one. ""The Warlords"" is a great epic war movie based on historical events:the last decades of the Qing dynasty, in particular the years of the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) that cost the lives of 70 000 000 people (that's 10m more than World War II, but who's counting). I agree that this is the best Chinese movie 2007, though Ang Lee's ""Lust.Caution"" is very good too. The Warlords movie budget was $ 40 million(after seeing it you will ask yourself ""How did they do that with so little money?!?"")A production of the same caliber would cost in the US at least $ 100 million. But this movie is the proof that cheap stuff that comes form China isn't always bad.Same with the outstanding performance of Jet Li(out of the $40m budget he received $13m payment)who was worth the money.There is a lot of drama in the movie, but also a lot of action.If you like battle scenes like in ""Braveheart"" this movie will deliver.If you liked ""Crouching Tiger, hidden dragon"" and ""Hero"" you will like this one.""The Warlords"" though is not a fairytale like those two, it is very realistic and if you are expecting to see people flying around,kung fu fighting or something like that, you will be disappointed.There is none of this here.But the movie is good. ten stars."

I read the good reviews on this one, and agree with most of them. Everything in this movie is superbly done.There's little story in this movie and it's more of a background for the characters' portrayal and the battles, both of which amazingly done. The characters' portrayal is very successful due to the great acting. The battles and the fight choreography deserves a solid 9. Both artistic, like the martial arts beauty, and brutal, like real war is.This movie doesn't have unnecessary emotion, or unnecessary gestures from main characters. That's where this movie succeeds. That's where 'Azumi' or 'Braveheart' succeeded. And that's where 'Troy' and 'Gladiator' failed to deliver. They all have great cinematography, brilliant fight choreography and superb acting staff - but that's only the technical side. 'Warlords' succeeded to deliver in all the aspects. Simple and little story with no over-dramatizing and no inconsistencies.If one's wondering why I gave only 7, it's because, beside of Er-hu, I didn't find one likable character."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"In ""The Warlords,"" another rendition of the classic Chinese tale of loyalty and betrayal of three brothers, we see evidence of something many may not realize: when not hampered by his horrible accent, Jet Li can act, in fact, for this role he received an Asian Film Award nomination for Best Actor. He may not be a Deniro or a Denzel, but he's at least got that certain intensity that makes Clint Eastwood. We do not, however, get to see what American audiences know Li for, his martial arts prowess. As winner of the Hong Kong Film Awards both for best film and best director, Peter Chan (""The Eye,"" 1 through infinity it seems), we see here an exemplary piece of cinema which demonstrates the high quality of movies coming from China today. The cinematography is well done, costumes are excellent, epic battle sequences are choreographed beautifully and the characters and complex character relationships are well developed, sincere and sympathetic. In addition to Li, we see moving performances by Andy Lau, a winner of numerous Asian film awards, and Takeshi Kaneshiro, both who Americans may know from ""The House of Flying Daggers."" If you are looking for a ""Jet Li movie"" you may likely find yourself bored. Despite the war background of this movie it is, at heart, a drama, and a very good one at that.http://zombiehor.de/"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Director Peter Chan's latest blockbuster was a highly anticipated production during the Christmas season, where it is the only Chinese production that seems to stands out from the other Hollywood blockbusters at the same period.For the price of one ticket, you will not only get to see three well known actors (Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro), but also a war drama between the country and brotherhood, which has exceed most people's expectation.Set during the Taiping Rebellion during the 1860's to 1870's in China, we were introduced to General Pang Qing Yun (Li) as the only survivor in a war with the enemies. He was taken in by a lady named Lian (China actress Xu Jing Lei), where he developed feelings for her when she offers him some food. Later, he follows two brothers, Zhao Er Hu (Lau) and Jiang Wu Yang (Kaneshiro), who were Robin Hood liked bandits, to rob for food from the military.After Pang saves Zhao from the military, he sworn into a brotherhood with Zhao and Jiang. They entered the military together with other male bandits and their bonds becomes stronger after going through a war. However, this marks the beginning to end the brotherhoods among the trio.Pang wants to conquer the other states at all cost, while Zhao insisted in peace talks to avoid more casualties. At the same time, Pang develops feelings for Lian, and upon to know that Lian is the wife of Zhao, Pang takes back Zhao's promises to a group of soldier under their captivity of releasing them by killing them.The war has come to an end and the trio has been living in peace. However, Pang wants more than what he has, and for that, he turned towards Zhao to achieve his motives, and Jiang wants to stop the break-up of the brotherhood at all costs.While The Warlords is based on the late Hong Kong movie director Chang Cheh's 1973's The Blood Brothers, Chan has make The Warlords looks much more better, yet preserving the spirit of Blood Brothers at the same time. It is amazing that a director who makes romantic dramas could churn out a great war epic with swordfighting elements, and at the same time, brings out the emotion of the humans.The battle scene which appears shortly after the the start of the movie marks the success of the movie, where we see people sacrificing themselves for the bonds of brotherhood, and towards a better life. This is one of the values that can be seen through in the movie. In some way, the battle scene resembles the climax of Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai (2003).At the same time, the relationship between Pang, Zhao, Jiang and Lian shows the desire and the dark side of the human nature and emotions, which is also similar to Zwick's The Legends of the Fall (1994), where father and sons fall out over a woman they loved.Commenting on the performance of the leading cast, Jet Li gets a major makeover in the film, followed by Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Playing the role of General Pang, Li express himself with more dialogues than action. Unlike his previous Hollywood productions, one will not see much action from him. More rather, he can tell you that he is more than just a actor who knows how to fight with martial arts. He will surprise you with the emotions that has been brought out to the audience. Lau, as Zhao Er Hu, creates a different feeling to fans who has watched his previous productions. He is more emotional and easily reveals his feelings than anyone else. This is another great change seen from Lau, compared to his previous productions.Kaneshiro and Xu, on the other hand, were not given enough spaces to explore themselves. Playing the role of Jiang, Kaneshiro was the youngest, and the most innocent and easily influenced among the trio. He show he has what it takes to bring out the hatred and struggle among himself (which can be told from the head cutting scene in the battle). Xu, as Lian, the woman whom both Pang and Zhao in loves with, seems to be unimportant in the film. She appears only when both Pang and Zhao needs her to be by their side. Xu could have been given more opportunities to explore the relationship among herself and the three men.Human emotions and war have never looked so good when combined together. And to amaze the audience even further, this is the first time Peter Chan tried to combine the two elements together. Chan has exceeded the expectations from the audience after several martial arts flop of similar genres from art-house and drama directors, ever after since Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) has put Chinese martial art on world map."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Part martial arts movie, part historical epic, director Peter Chan's film 'The Warlords' recreates the Taiping rebellion in China. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a mess; both in terms of the movements in the action scenes, and in terms of the high politics, I found it very hard to follow who exactly was doing what to whom; but all too easy to get the general drift of a movie that was big on set pieces but low on subtlety. Most crucially, the film conveys no idea whatsoever of what the rebellion was actually about in its story of three ""blood brothers"" motivated solely by personal oath. The result: lots of blood, but not too much in the way of enlightenment."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"By 1861, the Christian Taiping Rebellion from its capital Nanking has conquered half of Imperial China. The corrupt Ching court orders General Pang Qingyun (Jet Li) to join with General Ho in an attack on the rebels. General Ho is a corrupt powerful leader. He withdraws his forces and lets Pang's men be massacred. Pang escapes by pretending to be dead. Jiang Wuyang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Zhao Erhu (Andy Lau) leads a local militia. Zhao Erhu is unwilling to take in Pang and then General Ho's men confiscate provisions from them. The three men join in a blood oath to lead a loyalist militia to battle the rebels all the way to Nanking. Qingyun has an affair with Erhu's wife Liansheng laying the seed for their destruction by Ho and the corrupt court.There are tons of rooting interest problems. There is a main villain in Ho and a bunch of little villains in the court. Yet the three heroes never fight against them. They fight rebels who are perfectly honorable, by the movie's own notions. In fact, the Taiping commander does the most selfless act in the entire movie. This makes the big battles not much fun. The audience is forced to root for commanders working for Darth Vader. This is essentially a Greek tragedy and the movie should know that. It tries to be an action adventure war movie and that only highlights its tonal problems. Jet Li's character is terribly flawed in so many ways. This should be Shakespearian, not Michael Bay."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Since I've watched MUSA (The Warrior) a few years ago, I'm kinda spoiled. It's really difficult for any other movie, that sets out to outdo MUSA. I haven't watched any movie who could outdo it. Warlords didn't achieve that either, but it's still a very good movie. Which is thanks to the stellar cast (performances), which include Andy Lau, Jet Lee and Takeshi Kaneshiro.Unfortunately the first time I watched the movie, I did see the dubbed (english) version of it (with Greek subtitles). I couldn't really enjoy it, because quite frankly the dubbing was really bad (you can't re-create a certain mood), but I had the chance to see it again recently and as expected I did like it a lot. I even saw a few new things, character bits in it. It has also great (battle) fight scenes in it, it has a political side to it and small love story. If you're not afraid of watching an Eastern or even better, you like watching them, than you should give this a try!"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"From the Warring States Period going all the way back to the 5th century BC, wars have wracked China seemingly without pause. During the second half of the 19th century, and the late Qing/Ching/Manchu dynasty, some 50 million soldiers, bandits, and civilians died in the endless conflict.Watching ""Warlords,"" screened for the first time in North America Saturday night in the Castro Theater, part of the San Francisco International Film Festival, at times one might have thought that most of those casualties are shown - often in close-ups - in the film.Beginning with a view reminiscent of the Normandy invasion sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the film by Peter Chan and Wai Man Yip depicts combat vividly and intensely. Chung Man Yee's production design peaks at times in virtually unprecedented battle-field spectacles.There is no resolution, no peace, and only a quasi-relevant love story (featuring Jinglei Xu), but ""Warlords"" goes well beyond just fightin' and killin' and dyin'. Right from the beginning, as Jet Li's General Pang picks himself up from under the bodies of his dead soldiers, you notice two things: Jet Li's complete lack of vanity and the ability of this martial-arts star to act convincingly and well.The Manchu style of the head shaved in front and the hair gathered in a ponytail in the back looks hideous when it's all messed up, especially with blood. Jet Li not only appears half dead in his first appearance, but he is taking a bad-hair day to its absolute worst. And then, you also notice that Famous Jet Li - who is NOT flying through the air in this film - has been replaced by an honest and talented actor who brings to life a complex, conflicted, tragic character.With shifting alliances, goals, and always at the edge of extinction, Pang and his two ""blood brothers,"" Takeshi Kaneshiro's soulful Jiang Wuyang and Andy Lau's towering Zhao Erhu (perhaps Lau's best-ever performance), struggle from small-time wars all the way to the taking of Nanking on behalf of the fast-fading central (so to speak) government in Beijing. The same history-based story has been told, in more modest terms, in Zhang Che's 1973 ""The Blood Brothers."" A historical war film, a brutal but not gratuitously violent drama, ""Warlords"" impresses, even stuns, but in the end fails to provide catharsis or even an attempt to make sense of the senseless - something Zhang Yimou came close to in ""Hero"" (also with Jet Li, playing a similar historic character)."

You will be stunned by the intense constant evolution of the story line and relationships between 3 men who have much to learn from each other.I don't wanna spoil further. I want to say that i am really disappointed in the west for turning a blind eye to eastern movies in general. This movie is an epic. It deserves 20 000 votes. I cannot believe some of the movies that reach Nr 1 at the Box Office when only a relative few informed bothering with movies like this. This is some timeless movie making."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Perhaps the quality of this film becomes most apparent when compared to other productions of similar genre. My experience of watching Three Kingdoms has become a fading memory on a dusty shelf after I watched Warlords. It's the kind of movie that reminds you that there are websites where one can review movies, and doesn't let you rest until you tell others about it.Essentially, Tau Ming Chong is a tragedy, making a steep turn into the dark closer towards the end. It may be a bit on the heavy side, but by the time you realize that, the movie has already sucked you in completely.An excellent acting team led by Jet Li makes sure that everything else is just frosting around the cake of well developed characters. That's not to say that the frosting is inferior. This movie has everything going for it: choreography, special effects, sound and story. It has a something for everyone, although Warlords is definitely a boys' movie, full of hardcore violence, brotherhood issues and politics. The story is raw and keeps the mind occupied with some of its steeper turns.If you liked movies like Troy, chances are you'll enjoy it's much darker Eastern family member Tau Ming Chong, possibly one of the best movies ever created."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"..for a movie that's a bit difficult for Western audiences to enjoy. I mean, let's face it, we're not exactly suckers for blood oaths as the main plot device, which is the case here, and the story may feel hard to follow at times.Two things made be enjoy this one. For one thing, the Chinese did a pretty good job as far as giving the movie the proper epic side it needed. There's only a fine line between epic cinematography and drollery and these guys managed not to cross it, unlike, say, Gladiator or '300'.Then, there's the acting. Having only seen Jet Li in Hollywood movies before I thought he was something of a Jackie Chan without the funny face. I stand corrected, he gives a great performance in Tau Ming Chong, he is truly believable as his character, general Pang, gradually turns into a ruthless backstabbing freak for power. Finally, kudos to the actor playing Er Hu, Andy Lau. I hope I'll get to see more of him.Having seen the abominable blockbuster that 'The Last Samurai' really is the other night, it definitely enhanced my appreciation for this title."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"General Pang (Jet Li) survives a massacre when he and his men are betrayed. He does this by pretending to be dead. Wandering from the battlefield he staggers through the countryside. Collapsing near an abandoned house he is saved by a young woman who makes him food. In the morning she is gone. After selling his armor he falls in with a group of bandits who are stealing food for their village. After the village is beaten in an attack by a rival village Pang convinces the villagers to join one of the armies to get protection and food. To assure that Pang will not betray them Pang forms a pact with Er-Hu (Andy Lau) and Zhang (Takeshi Kaneshiro). The blood brothers then lead their men off to war and an uncertain future.Cutting to the chase, this is the first great film I've seen this year (2008). Pretty much everything about this film is top notch. This is an epic action film that has a great deal on its mind. This is a film that has romance; examines war, both its glory and its cost (for example the trench siege of the city); high level politics; honor; the bond between brothers in arms; the promises we make and a couple of other things I'm too overwhelmed to recall. Its been rare that I've seen an action film that dealt with more than just macho notions of honor and right and wrong.The action is top notch. There is everything from one on one combat to huge scale battle scenes. Its also very graphic and very bloody. Limbs and blood fly. No matter how they did it the action has impact, both in the ""oh Wow"" sense and the gut turning ""this is the cost of violence"" sense. The film also knows when to keep things off screen for heartbreaking effect. Its mind blowing.Need I go into the costuming and set design? You must see this on as big a screen as possible. Its overwhelming in the sense of scale. These are real big places. These are huge armies. I'm floored. Its like the epic Hero, Curse of the Golden Flower, The Banquet or House of Flying Daggers but in a gritty real lived in sort of way.The score is hypnotic. Several times the score drives the film, lifting it up from the realm of film to something much more lyric and poetic. For me the film is often a tone poem, a visual and aural meditation on the nature of the human condition as portrayed in the film. Yes I can tell you what is going on logically and dramatically but thanks to the score and its marriage to the visuals both horrific and beautiful the film ceases to touch the intellect but instead touches the heart and the gut. More often than not I felt things more than I ""thought things"". which is why my words are severely lacking for describing much of the film. (Its also why I have forgiven pretty much any flaws the film may have, I was too emotional to care). If you want an example of what a great score can do you need look no further.The acting is Oscar worthy. Andy Lau is as good as he always is. He is one of the best actors working in Chinese cinema. Takeshi Kaneshiro is equally good. The real revelation here is Jet Li. I was floored by his performance in Unleashed, but this is so much more. Here he gives a performance that is layered and touching. We feel his pain at the loss of his men in the early scenes, later we ache for the pain of his love that is just out of his reach. If there is any flaw in his performance its perhaps that in the second half as fortunes change and the situations begin to move out of his grasp he becomes too internal. To be certain there is the confusion in his eyes but his face is a bit too impassive.If there is a flaw its that the film has almost too much going on. There is a large scale scope to the film and it has almost too many plot lines to resolve. It does so, I think satisfactorily, however there are times when I felt that I was missing something.I can't say enough good about this film.9 out of 10, because its not perfect (but pretty close)Addendum To be honest thinking about the film some twelve hours after seeing it I'm feeling a tad disappointed about it. Only in that that the final portion of the film has so much going on that I'm not sure the plot is that clear. I think that the craft of the film engages on an emotional level that carries the film to the end even when the plot fails to fully engage the mind. This doesn't really change what I think of the film: I still think its a great achievement"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I'm not a fan of Peter Chan's films... didn't like COMRADES, ALMOST A LOVE STORY (1996), thought HE'S A WOMAN, SHE'S A MAN (1994) was OK, but not spectacular. His films are often injected with a little too much calculated sentimentality to me. Yet after watching WARLORDS (2007), I must say this is the first film that made me feel the calculations worked. Peter Chan learned from the mistakes of Zhang Yimou with HERO (2002), HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, and that lame piece of crap CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (2006), he learned that big production and art direction doesn't mean the audience won't expect a good story and direction to go with a film, he also learned that Andrew Lau's triad-gangster-cop INFERNAL AFFAIRS formula can get old if you keep heading toward a beaten path... furthermore, any film that glorifies gangster camaraderie almost means doom with the Chinese film board.What Peter Chan did was very clever, he actually found a story that allows Andy Lau's affected style of acting to fit the context of a story - WAR. Lau's acting never convinced me in contemporary story lines, but it worked with WARLORDS. In fact, he used all three of the male leads to their type-casted best - Jet Li reprises the hero who sees the greater good but has to accept the fact - that nothing comes without a price, while Takeshi assumes, again, the role of a passive and reluctant hero caught in a crossfire. All the special effects come from the same software you see in big budget films whether it is South Korea, Hollywood, Europe, or Japan, and production value is nothing less than any of the pretty-but-empty period-pieces Zhang Yimou or Chen Kaige tried to fool audiences with... I can see the homage/inspiration from Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, the original GET CARTER,... there were even moments where I thought I was watching a tribute to John Woo's A BETTER TOMORROW or THE KILLER -- WARLORDS (2007) is Peter Chan's best film to date, and while there is plenty of sentimentality in the key scenes, the context and the flow of the story actually lifted it from what could have been melodrama, to quite compelling performances.Whatever calculations and formulas Peter Chan used on his previous films that I didn't like, the math worked for WARLORDS (2007)... and what results is some of the best performances I've seen from Jet Li that doesn't start and end with just fight scenes...What I'm amazed with is how a Chinese period film is also one of the better anti-war movies I've seen in a long while."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"On the question of whether one would like this film, lot of it is dependent on whether you prefer Shakespeare or Sophocles in tragedy. As in the tragedy is not character-driven, but fate-driven, if you get my drift. It is about people born into the wrong time, rather than people who make the wrong decisions. This film is strictly Sophocles, not Shakespeare. In fact, it borrows heavily off classical Greek tragedy in its structure, along with three Mandarins who act as a Chorus.Jet Li stars as an ambitious general with Utopian ideals in late Qing China during the turbulent Taiping era. Western Colonialism was making its presence felt, and the crumbling dynasty as unable to stop it as everyone played for himself in a game of see who's the last rat to dive off the sinking ship. The Taiping Rebellion was also promising a Christian Utopia, but led by madmen every bit as fanatical as anyone that got drunk on religion will ever get, seemed like hardly an alternative.Probably the only Chinese epic I have seen (fittingly, since its setting was the Taiping Rebellion) to have used Christian imagery, including a really bastardized retelling of the miracle of the loaves and fishes that would border on sacrilegious if taken out of context. Watch out for one scene involving a baptism pool. Beautifully done.Visually though it is meticulous, barring some sloppy special effects here and there. The entire film feels like a Sergio Leone wetdream. Blasted heaths, wrecked buildings, windswept plains and rainy nights all combine for an atmospheric effect akin to the best Westerns that ever came out of Hollywood's Golden Age.However, one key determinant will make or break your liking for the film. I have always preferred Shakespearean tragedy to Greek, and wonder why current Chinese filmmakers have yet to make a competent Shakespearean tragedy. (And no, I did not like THE BANQUET). And the fact that the film was classically Greek in structure and storytelling was the bit of a letdown for me. I admire its panache, its style, its storytelling, most of everything about it, except that somehow I never really engaged with the characters and their struggles.What I feel a lot of people are missing out, or may be, is that this really the antithesis of Heroic Cinema, it is Anti-Heroic cinema. A harsh satire on the limits of principle and self-righteousness of not just Chinese rulers, but also many of the self-proclaimed ""heroes"" of Chinese history. Yet all of them are also prisoners of their time and culture. The characters of Kaneshiro and Lau are bandits, and as such, their moral outlook is painfully limited, to them there is only the ""fellow outlaw"" to be faithful to, not the people. They claim moral high ground, but instead when they rush into battle their cry is always to get rich, fed and laid: nothing more than the aspirations of a common criminal. Jet Li's character, Pang Qingyun, believes that he is faithful to the people, even if this also means killing POWs, has a claim that ""in war, only winning matters!"" and thus in the end is also ousted by a bloodthirsty political culture in which ""only winning matters"". The characters all appear to be doing right in their own eyes, but they are constricted by their society and their culture and their period into being painfully flawed figures. This is where THE WARLORDS strikes gold among recent Chinese epics. It may be read as a rebuttal to what appears as character in history, but is really sanctimony, and perhaps strikes at the heart of the fact that all heroic narratives are written by the victors, and therefore all heroic narrative is inherently sanctimonious.PS And is it just me, or does everyone want to borrow off Hans Zimmer's score for GLADIATOR now?"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I want to start this review with a warning because, like the other 2007 Chinese movie ""Lust Caution"" with a similarly ""monochromatic/ realistic"" palette, the marketing of this movie is basically an attempt to entice people who might be uninterested in the actual themes of the movie-- the truth is, ""Warlords"" can only be considered a ""heroic war epic"" if ""Lust Caution"" can be considered a ""sexy spy thriller"". In other words, nasty war sequences (like the nasty sex scenes in ""Lust Caution"") were filmed to show the ""why's"", not the ""how's"". In fact, after a small-scaled (only a few thousand men involved) but ""FULL-ON"" (Infantry + Archers + Musketeers + Artillery + Cavalry + Jet Li) battle set-piece in the first half of the movie-- which actually left some members of the audience physically shaking-- it became very obvious that the movie/ director (much like ""Lust Caution"") has very little interest in depicting the actual events of the war.Only the opening titles will tell you that this war, specifically the Taiping rebellion of 1850s-60s, resulted in the loss of 70 million lives-- so people thinking to satisfy their blood-lust with this movie should be forewarned that after all the characters and premises have been introduced, the remaining years of fighting are only ""depicted"" through various montages and cinematic/ plot devices. In fact, I find this movie more a connected series of stark war stories/ vignettes about coal mining villages, boy soldiers, etc. than anything else. In short, anyone coming in clueless about that part of Chinese history is unlikely to learn much by watching this movie-- the British and the French, etc. were encroaching, the Hui Muslims and Shandong rogue armies, etc. were rebelling, Empress Dowager Cixi was power-grabbing, and everyone was making ""deals""... no 2-hour movie will show you all that.But there are still some problems with this movie, which made me take away a few points. Being an Asian movie, weaknesses in effects and production values still show up here and there (some ""dubious"" CGI and such). And being a Hong Kong-styled commercial release, the need/ decision to cut its running time down to 2 hours made it feel ""over-edited"" to me. E.g. By cutting out all the love/ sex scenes, I ""knew"" about the romantic relationships, but didn't really understand it (a bad case of ""tell but don't show""); and during lengthier shots and scenes, the director/ editor kept cutting back and forth as if he didn't trust the strength of the actors or the script to hold up the tension. But enough with the reservations-- let's get on to the good stuff.1) CINEMATOGRAPHY. Most films are color-corrected to bring out their colors and contrasts, with sci-fi/ fantasy/ effects movies (and cinematographer-turned-directors like Zhang Yimou) being the most notorious for doing this. But this film was color-corrected to ""drain out"" the colors so that it looked like some historical film footage from the 1860s, if such a thing were possible. And when some colors do appear, they only gave the film a fable-like mood of a legend being re-told. This heightened sense of ""(sur-)realism"" set by the cinematography was so powerful that there were only sobs or silence from the audience for the length of 2 hours.2) ACTION CHOREOGRAPHY. Hong Kong action directors/ choreographers must be pure magic-- because they can still create hair-raising action sequences when thrown into the lot with clueless first-time action directors like Peter Chan (with Ching Siu-Tung in this movie), Ang Lee (with Yuen Woo-Ping in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), etc.. The 4 short action sequences (2 battles, 2 fights) and various ""bit-fighting"" in this film are swift, precise and brutal-- nothing to drool at in the way of wuxia or comic-book violence, but with enough ""in-your-face"" realism to put this movie above the equivalent of any PG-rating in most film markets. And Jet Li, without displaying any martial arts ""forms"", was simply riveting to watch.3) SOCIAL COMMENTARY. The ""commentary"" is at once blatant and subtle-- and this is the reason (over and above the action sequences) for the positive reviews and word-of-mouth coming from viewers who ""get it"". It is blatantly clear that all sympathies lie with the ""little guys"" or ""underdogs""-- and yet everything remains quite subtle because none of the characters sees enough of the ""big picture"" to sell the audience any underlying messages. By setting the story in the twilight years of the Taiping rebellion (the film ends in 1870), it easily makes the point-- without anyone actually having to say so-- that the government wasn't eager to end a conflict which yielded political/ economic profit. The movie was just brimming with ideas.4) SIEGE OF SUZHOU. This siege, which started off the 2nd half of the movie, was where opinions really divided between the die-hard war/ history fans and more regular movie audiences-- because the director's true vision started coming through with a quiet but almost complete turnabout in pace/ genre. In a film filled with arresting/ disturbing images, the highly ""romanticized"" (and near-""mythical"") introduction of a remaining rebel leader pushes the characters' personal dilemmas to an almost ""ethical/ spiritual"" level (the founder of the Taiping rebellion claimed to be the ""Brother of Christ"" and named his regime the ""Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping""). It might make or break the rest of the movie for some viewers.I could go on about the rows of rice offerings or shoes with wooden name-tags, etc., but would rather keep this review relatively spoiler-free. However, something should be said about the ""historical accuracy"" of this movie-- there is none, because all the names and events have been ""changed"". E.g. Jet Li's character is now named Pang Qing-yun, which (in Chinese, literally ""clouds in the sky"") reflects his ambitions, etc.. So apart from the general historical context/ outline, all events and characters portrayed in the movie are fictional...."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Yes, it is very powerful and very underrated. Hmm let me start with what most people now days search for in movies which is called acting!! In this movie you will see a very very powerful acting from Jet li,Andy Lau, and Takeshi Kaneshiro. I guarantee you, you will be treated with huge moment of sadness, happiness, disturbing moments that were all well acted by those 3.At the begging there was a lot of martial arts and fights, however it got less and less due to the director deciding to show or send a msg about what is war all about, and believe me he succeeded, personally I cant believe there are still wars around the globe after watching this movie kinda makes you worry huh?!?! In the end, The movie overall was very very sad disturbing and very sadly entertaining, but its all Jet li its like he was born for this character, he played a very complex character, if you want to watch this movie you wont regret it."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"'The Warlords' is a good film. Not great as expected. Not excellent as I had hoped. From the onset the film felt dated, although some of the battle scenes are absolutely fantastic.The first half of the film is exciting and action-packed, with some incredible action sequences. Pity then that the film became over-complicated, confusing and far too political during the second half, and towards the end. It also became much slower moving with too much (political) talk.The film also forces a romance interest into an already crammed premise. There honestly was no need for the Liansheng character in the movie and she didn't really contribute much either. On the contrary, the character ruined some of the interesting moments and - as mentioned - only further complicated the film.Although 'The Warlords' is an incredible production, it won't go down as one of my favorites, or most memorable films. I must mention Jet Li was very good in this film, in a very different role to what we're used to."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Could be too much competition among screenplay writers, I mean there are 8 writers mentioned on IMDb for this movie - actually we can see more writers then actors here. Could be, they just didn't cooperate that well... The general idea is good, makes lots of sense, three people swear loyalty to each other, but one is ready to sacrifice the pledge and to kill anybodybody who stands in his way, to fulfill his dream. Still the script doesn't hold, sth is wrong, audience get confused: what's going on with this girl? what was it with court machinations? I had this feeling, maybe each writer had his own agenda and tried to convert the audience during the short sequence he was assigned to... Another huge problem is the cast. There is sth really misplaced there. Jet Lee should not be the main hero here, he can be truly great as a particular kind of hero(a rather simple and silent one) but there is no way he could adjust himself to play a very complicated character. Andy Lau on the other hand is very good - only, he doesn't have that much to do. Still he does his best and somehow holds the story together even though the character he plays is a bit, well, underwritten (script again, sigh...) And of course big thumbs up (is not yet copyrighted, is it ;) for Kaneshiro Takeshi, with the same complain: I so much wish he had more to play. Jinglei Xu doesn't have much to doso she doesn't. Music, SIGH... one part (I think around the battle of Suzhou?) it was actually sth like the Pirates of Caribbean; apart from that rather funny piece you mostly get sort of generic holywoodish ""War and Love"" tunes (fortunately interrupted with a kind of Beijing Opera). Still is not a totally bad movie, cinematography is excellent, there is a bit of decent acting (two bits ;) very good fighting choreography and impressive costumes."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Set in China in the 1860s, during the Taiping Rebellion. Loosely based on three real warlords, who raised an army to fight against this rebellion and in the process restored the rule of the Qing Dynasty.Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro play the leads here as the three warlords, who come from different walks of life, but who through the atrocities of war are brought together and end up swearing a blood oath of brotherhood, to stick together and end the war on their terms. The movie very heavily rests on their shoulders and they do not disappoint. The best scenes in this film are those where all three of them face one another, either in unison or in conflict.Unfortunately the script is somewhat lacking. These three actors could handle heavier stuff, but the dialogue they're given, especially in these situations they're set in, don't quite reach the level of greatness they perhaps could.The film also looks oddly drab. I guess they wanted to go for a more realistic style, compared to more usual outlandish Chinese historical films, but it still comes off as planned because now everyone is dressed universally in black, which looks outlandish as well, just in a very different way.To the film's credit, I say that the group battle scenes are really good looking. Some of the best I've seen in years. Although, on the flip side, the individual battles are jerky messes. Especially considering that you had Jet Li as the main character!Still, it is definitely a film worth checking out if you're into Chinese period war films."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"What is your stereotype of Jet Li? The King of Martial Art? The Asian Romeo who kicks some bad ass but never gets the girl? Mr. Friendly who always acts with that same old smile? Well, some of them might be true, while some not. However, many audiences might change their viewpoints after watching Jet Li's performance in Warlords. In this Chinese epic movie, Jet Li interpreted Pang, a man who was caught in complicated nets of brotherhood, lust, and betrayal. Along with his sidekicks-turn-into-enemies Zhao (Andy Lau) and Jiang (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who competed against Pang (Jet Li) as characters and as actors, Jet Li's performance was even sharpened and bettered. Getting to speak his mother tongue Mandarin also gave him extra credits. This distinguished him from his present participation in Hollywood films, in which he had to speak a foreign language and became stereotyped (and probably marginalized). I dare to say it's Jet Li's best performance ever. His babyface could no longer cover those keen eyes of an actor. In the scene where he treated Zhao the last meal, which turned out to be a soliloquy, his conflicts were shown in his tone. When he covered his face with a handkerchief and wept, those hysterical cries were disturbingly heartbreaking. It's the sort of scream that comes from a desperate old man, who's been through a great deal of ups and downs in his life. Warlords definitely ensures Li's stardom as an actor.Unlike other martial art movie directors, most of whom getting busy on how to make the scenes spectacular and the actors against gravity, Peter Chan believes in the significance of a good story. He is famous for his romance productions, such as Perhaps Love(如果˙愛), Three(三更之回家), etc, and that might be the reason why he successfully added a soft yet moving touch to the masculine story. Even though Warlords is based on one of the four great legends in Chin Dynasty, The Assassination of Ma, which is sensational and suspenseful, the director insisted that the screenplay should also deliver the raw cruelty of wartime and in the mean while be compelling and persuasive. Apparently, according to the movie itself, Peter Chan has proved that he can direct romances and masculine movies as well.However, I don't personally like the English title Warlords. Tou-Ming-Juang, the Chinese title of the film, means the vow people take when friends want to become brothers. Usually a typical oath of this sort is written this way: Even though we're not born at the same time, we'd rather die together. Thus, whoever breaks the vow will have to face extreme punishment and revenge. This vow brought out the dramatic effect of the climax scene where the murder of brothers took place. But since Warlords makes more sense to foreigners than Tou-Ming-Juang, I'd say it's a safe choice for it sounds proficient for an epic movie.I think it's a must-watch in 2007 not only for the great performance but also the lessons behind it. The war is cruel, and the men in wartime inevitably become cruel, too."

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Joint Chinese-Hong Kong venture The Warlords is a somewhat troubled but additionally somewhat interesting account of the relationship between three men, told amidst the backdrop of something far grander, that is the true event of an allusive and mysterious murder that happened in China, in 1870. Rather than have an opinion of or make a statement on these events; it is more a study of power play and control, and how with so much at stake and so many at one's disposal, things can quite feasibly fall drastically apart if trust and loyalty between those within the higher-ups isn't prominent. Alas, the film sounds more interesting than it is; providing us with a collection of interesting ideas and themes but placing them in scenes that feel mechanical and obligatory as everything plays out to the conclusion.For all the sense of scope and the sheer grandness behind it, what with the hundreds of extras and the vast, open settings; the fact of the matter that The Warlords essentially boils down to the link between these three male individuals, and one additional female, is quite extraordinary. There might even be an argument that the film makes for a better romance picture, and by the end is more interested in the destructive nature of love than lust for power and control over territories. The three men predominantly involved are Zhang Wen-Xiang (Kaneshiro); Zhao Er-Hu (Lau) and Pang Qingyun, who is played by Jet Li. The film thrusts us into the the forefront of Qing Dynasty China, with a nasty; sweaty; bloody battle coming to an end in which Jet Li's character General stumbles away as the sole survivor of his forces following the dishonourable act of pretending to have been killed so as to avoid further fighting. From here, a certain female by name of Lian (Xu) is introduced, as are the other two mentioned warriors; both of whom are happy to join Pang's military connections when it appears all is lost for the clan-come-townspeople they live with following a raid which leaves them starving and in bad shape. As one observes: ""Better dead than this life"". Over the course of The Warlords, these four characters' will have their lives transformed as they venture, interact and conquer with one another.But it's frustrating how the film doesn't seem to seal the deal with aplomb. The new recruits are pretty content with their new roles as sword wielding, uniform-clad soldiers whose job it is to seriously injure the opposing force; and there's that sense amongst them that they want to fight and want to push on into battle in order to get that chance. It's here that, indeed maybe for some, the characters' attitudes will echo those of the watching audience who are brought in under the pretense they're initially in for an action film. It's here that The Warlords touches on another dominant aspect, or theme, of the war genre. To pluck a random example out of the air, cast your mind back to 1986's Platoon and how that film's first person retelling of what war was really like got across a sense of not wanting to be there; not wanting the uniform and the weapon and really getting across a sense of terror. The Warlords sees its characters invite the warfare, indeed violence is got across as the only way in which to solve problems in the film.There is also that sense of repetition; that sporadic and unnatural flow of battle scenes inter-cut with visits to the Quing lords for reinforcements as well as a few instances in which the trouble amidst the three lead males is becoming more and more apparent. Sprinkle in a couple of silly proverbs-come-one-liners such as ""Dying is easy, living is tough."" and the reassurance that ""Loyalty is everything."" and you have pretty wavy, uneasy passage of scenes. Trouble is, most of the conflict within the higher-ups is moderately interesting at best, with conflict arising over how rapists ought to be punished and whether, in one particularly cold blooded scene, dozens of prisoners of war should be executed. While there isn't much in the way of suspense nor peril during most of the battle scenes; in the sense you don't have the immediate feeling that anyone is in danger; or might get hurt or injured.The film creaks and thuds into its final third, with the character of Lian taking the reins and driving the actions of these men as their antagonism changes from push to shove. The film has been released in various countries with various different levels of distribution over the last couple of calendar years, hitting Asia in late 2007 before gradually crawling across Europe, in certain forms, between the winter of 2008 and into the spring of 2009. In 2010, it'll get its American release and I think it'll do well; what with its overall arc of nobodies or 'underdogs' rising out of their respective shells and attempting to become big fish by taking them on at their own game. I think the casting of Jet Li and the promise of some big battle scenes all blended together with a romance sub-plot which'll form the basis for a love triangle spells good things, financially. It's probably worth seeing, overall, but I did not feel as involved as much as I would have liked."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Anti-War? Naturalistic violence? Chinese superstars known in the West? Eternal triangle plus girl? Yes, all these, and set in the modern times of the Taiping Revolt (19th century)where millions died at the fag end of Imperial China. But they do not add up to anything magical or even very good. The scenes and storyline all seem repetitive - blood brothers swearing allegiance to one another before betraying each other - but with no comeback till the end! The politics of the times is of the old men betraying young men and backing whoever will give them least trouble - universal but is far less interesting than the real issues of the war, especially as the West was busy interfering with supplying arms and not backing the Christian-like rebels (crucifixes are carried by the Taiping) as much as the Imperial side (General Gordon of Khartoum organised the Imperials!). The characters are too one-dimensional, the mud too obvious, the direction too glowering, the acting veering between heroic and small-time crooks, and the action desperately trying to get Jet Li and the others to fight with swords rather than guns! All in all, an interesting failure, where perhaps too many writers spoilt the broth!"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Warlords is a fascinating and great, sometimes shocking but not perfect story of the rise and fall of General Peng. The central theme consists of his political ambitions and how they conflict with the required loyalty to his blood brothers. General Peng has to make some nasty choices and they don't turn out well. As far as I know, but I am not an expert, this is Jet Li's finest role: enigmatic, brave, ambiguous, with questionable values. My main objection against Chinese movies of this kind is that they lack character development, but that does not apply to Warlords. Jet Li manages to stir up mixed feelings until the very last scene. If you thought you had seen it all regarding battle scenes Warlords will give you a surprise. Both the ambush and the great battle scene will pop your eyes out. There is no trace of romanticism, the cruelty of warfare is pictured in every detail without becoming gory. There are also a few great special effects, like when General Peng saves the life of one of his blood brothers. The key scene takes place after the Siege of Suzhou. The question arises: what to do with the 4000 prisoners? The dilemma is unsettling and here it becomes clear that things will definitely go wrong, for all three of the blood brothers. Warlords paints a grim picture of the Chinese civil wars in the 19th Century and the dirty politics involved. The result is of epic dimensions and can compete with any American and European movie of the same kind. My only complaint is that the movie is too short. I would have liked some more background information about the four main characters. The character of Lian remains unnecessarily shallow. Some intriguing scenes are not entirely developed. Finally I would like to know what happened afterwards with Zhang, the narrator of the story. But these are minor quibbles. If you like movies of the grandioso kind, don't miss Warlords."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Let's cut to the chase. ""The Warlords"" is not a good film, and here's why: the absence of a compelling reason for betrayal.The script seemed incredibly weak in terms of character development (the two most important elements  the blood oath and the love interest  were totally unconvincing). Everyone's a raving hypocrite in this movie; and that's fine, just don't expect me to care when they dig their own graves. As such, many supposedly tragic events will probably provoke a ""So what?"" response from astute viewers because the filmmakers apparently thought that emotion is elicited by the following: (1) Establish a blood brother relationship that's slapdash and lackadaisical. (2) Have a protagonist betray and kill their blood brother for no apparently good reason. (3) Have the betrayer shed some alligator tears.It simply doesn't work.Why do filmmakers always think that they can make their characters stark hypocrites and expect me to care for them? (Shinobi is another film that pulled the same crap.) Guess what, if you break a blood oath, YOU DESERVE TO DIE. That is, of course, why they call it a BLOOD OATH. Therefore, if you break a blood oath and subsequently die, I'm going to feel satisfied that you paid the consequences.One of the ridiculous reasons why Jet betrays Andy is alluded to by Kaneshiro: the love interest. Note, however, that this love interest has a grand total of 5 minutes of screen time during a 126-minute film. Am I the only one with enough common sense to realize that this is a huge flaw of this movie? Even worse, this film actually tries to portray Kaneshiro's killing of the love interest as some kind of dramatic moment. The wench was a two-timing slut. Why should I feel sorry for her? It makes no logical sense. The brotherhood itself seemed very contrived and rushed. Jet meets Andy and within 5 minutes they're blood brothers after one battle? LUDICROUS. Jet and Andy also need food and money, so they join the army and become blood brothers while knowing almost nothing about each other. Also LUDICROUS. Immediately before taking the blood oath, someone questions Jet by asking, ""Why should we trust you?"" A rather appropriate question that demands an answer before taking a blood oath. No such answer is given. One would think that taking a blood oath with someone you don't even trust is an incredibly stupid idea. Again, it's utterly LUDICROUS.And I'm supposed to feel sorry for these assclowns when they start killing each other off? Don't think so. Carelessness is no basis for sympathy. And what's with the soundtrack during the battle scene? One of the worst choices of scoring I've heard in some time.If there's one thing that exposes poorly developed characters, it's too much verbal exposition. ""The Warlords"" has tons of superfluous verbal exposition. For example, Kaneshiro mutters ""A brother who harms another brother must die!"" half a dozen times while attempting to kill Jet. Such tactics are used only in instances where the viewer must be reminded of a relationship that was ineffectively developed through previous character action. There are other instances where these three guys need to remind themselves that ""We are blood brothers."" This level of hollow superficiality is the type of thing we usually see in American movies. And no, that's not a compliment. Despite what many may say, this is a superficial, shallow movie with enough clichés to rival a typical Hollywood blockbuster. How on earth did this movie beat out ""Eye In the Sky"" for best film of the year? Easily the most overrated film of 2007.Watch ""Musa: The Warrior"" instead for a rich, complex, powerful expression of brotherhood during war times. ""The Warlords"" is a paper tiger."

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Tagline: A movie that requires a second viewing Review by Neo: As I have predicted in the forum weeks ago that Jet Li will win the Best Actor at the Hong Kong Films Award and rightly so he did. It is what the current reviewer will claim as a commanding performance in what is quite possibly Li's most difficult role yet. Even more impressive the fact that this is a war epic and in movies like these, the actors are usually out-shined by the sheer scale of the war battle sequences as well as the vision of the director. Luckily, as we have all grown to know, director Peter Chan is a people's director. After viewing this film in Hong Kong before Christmas on the opening day, Neo was left somewhat disappointed and disjointed, but as the current reviewer have always noted, some films will require a second viewing before one can truly appreciate it. The battle sequences is just absolutely amazing, and you can tell that Chan really putted his heart and soul into making this movie happening. It shows that Hong Kong cinema still can match the likes of Hollywood is making big budget movie epics and the dedication is alone worthy of special mention. Action director Ching Siu-Tung, the person behind Hero, Swordsman 2 and other epics, once again show that he is the director for the ancient times and the artistry in his shots are ceaselessly beautiful to watch.The beauty of Jet Li's character is that like humanity, he is both the hero and the villain. Everyone have a dream, whether to make the world a better place or some sort of utterly selfish ambition. Perhaps it is within the plan and vision of Li that wanted a utopia, but ultimately the things never goes as planned and that's reality of life. It is unfair to say that Li overshadows his respective brothers in the incomparable Andy Lau and Wong Kar Wai's favourite Takeshi Kaneshiro, as Li is given the most juicy yet most difficult role. Still, Li surpasses all expectations and the result is simply an outstanding performance, as a character that the audience can actually relates and feel for. Perhaps, we have all saw it coming, just take a glance of Hero, Unleashed and then last year Fearless, it is about time that Li is finally recognised as an actor. His internal turmoil as well as commanding performance is one to be envy of.Moving on to ""brother two"", comes in the form of Andy Lau, at first instance his role simple like a simple one. However, in a closer look at Lau's work, it is a more than commendable performance and take no further look than the moment that Lau is forced to witness his promise being broken and leading to the death of 4000 surrendered soldiers in total bloodbath. Likewise, Li's look on the face at that very instance is a priceless one to endure.Perhaps the weakest link is Takeshi Kaneshiro, but it may well be due to no fault of his own. His character is definitely the weakest of the three, but Takeshi more than redeemed himself in the final sequence with that revengeful look on his face as he continuously stabbed Li to his death. Not Takeshi's best display, but far from being his worst. As for the love interest, (Xu Jinglei) is miscast to a certain degree. Maybe it is just Neo, but she isn't exactly beautiful or sexy (though she looked good in Confession of Pain) and it is still a mystery as to why both Li and Lau are fighting for her love. A character being torn between loyalty and love, Xu is ultimately likable enough for the audience to sit through her performance.What the Warlords is trying to say is that war and any battles is ultimately a gamble and the end of the day, luck plays a crucial factor in the outcome. As noted earlier, Li aspired to a dream of one day everyone living in harmony, but the question lies in at what cost? Perhaps a better way of thinking would be what an English teacher once said – ""one man utopia is another dystopia."" The saying is very much true, but then again, in Neo's honest opinion, there is no such thing as a utopia. After all, it is in human nature to desire for things and what's one person vision and dream of a perfect world, may well be a shattering kind of world for the person next to you.All in all, The Warlords is by no means a perfect movie, but it is certainly a much better movie by the time the current reviewer have witness the situation the second time around. Still, at the end of the day, Director Chan is to be applauding for taking such a huge gamble to create such a lavish production at the current state of HK cinema and the result is certainly one successful commercial flick with a touch of arty flair. What this film lacks is ultimately a touching finale or perhaps one huge emotional punch at the audience. It is still a mystery as to how Chan can take so much time to develop the characters, and yet somehow it still falls short of his lofty ambitions. At the end of the day, let's be realistic, The Warlords is a great film by all measures, filled with great performances, terrific battle sequences done in a huge scale and with a director still very much in his prime of film making. So what's wrong with The Warlords and does it deserves all those awards that it have been sheltered with? The answer is that there is nothing wrong with this movie, it is just that people will have to watch it a second time to truly appreciate what Chan created (Neo 2008) I rate it 9/10www.thehkneo.com"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I couldn't finish this film and perhaps, for that reason, you should take my review with a grain of salt. But I feel strongly enough about it to write something anyway.The production values on this film are quite good - cinematography, acting, sets, action scenes, are all well done. The problem is that the story makes no sense and the politics are bizarre, to say the least.A general gets up from the battlefield. He has survived a massacre by playing dead - a premise that is made less and less credible by his heroic performance later on. He joins a group of bandits, killing some poor prisoner whom he knows nothing about in order to prove his loyalty to the other chieftains. He convinces the bandits to join the Ching army to fight against the Taiping, who are in revolt against the government because they (the bandits) can get food and money that way. They ambush a Taiping supply convoy and then offers a deal to the government army. He will take a city for them from the Taiping if they give him half the spoils. So far, so good. A man with no morals joins the bandits and, with them, becomes a mercenary soldier for a corrupt government. He plans to take a city, sack it, loot it, and keep the profits. It doesn't fit the fairly decent image created for the hero, but at least it's consistent.But then the film makers try to make this man into a genuine hero. He leads his forces selflessly into battle against Taiping soldiers - portrayed not as the ragtag peasant revolutionaries fighting with farm implements and having a religious motivation, as they actually were, but as a disciplined army with uniforms, officers, and rifles. He prepares to sacrifice his life to fight them.By great heroics, he wins the battle, ignoring the spear that has thrust all the way through his chest, and takes the city. The spear has magically disappeared and our hero seems unaffected by the wound. Then, amazingly, he orders the execution of two soldiers in his own army for raping women in the city! He says he is serving a higher purpose and will not allow that kind of stuff to ever happen again.Huh? Where did these scruples come from? He's just massacred an army for no reason other than pay. He's just fought for a corrupt government that is subservient to foreign interests and the interests of the rich landlords in the regions. He has just taken a city and, presumably, sacked it. He leaves the city with chests full of silver coins.I don't know what the Chinese writers, directors, and censors were thinking when they made this film. One is tempted to conclude that, however coherent the story might have been when originally written, it was bowdlerized to support the government above all and pretend that supporting the government is a good thing for everyone, even if it's corrupt.It was hard to take. I couldn't take it. Mao must be rolling over in his grave."

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Warlords is an intense period epic Chinese war film that was influenced by Chang Cheh's The Blood Brothers (which is also in my movie collection and I plan to revisit shortly). This takes place in the later period of The Ching Dynasty and was a time of war, strife and turmoil. Much like the film's of Chang Cheh and the heroic bloodshed movies that followed them, this movie is about brotherhood. Unlike those films, there is no stylized action scenes and the violence is portrayed in a gritty realistic and horrific fashion. The sets and costumes look fantastic as well and the cinematography is top tier. Jet Li ,Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro are sworn brothers and in this film these actors shine individually and collectively in this project. Jet Li shows lots of range here and nails playing this complex character. Warlords has lots of epic action scenes, but is backed up with dramatic scenes that are just as strong and more importantly have emotional resonance. There is some sophistication to accompany the barbarity of the film. I have not seen this in years and I must say Warlords, really is an outstanding piece of filmmaking and really holds up."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"THE WARLORDS is a typically overblown historical epic, full of pomposity and grandeur, a film of heroism, murder and larger than life characters. Such films have been very popular in Asia in recent years, with notable highlights including wushu flick HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS and the quite wonderful CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. THE WARLORDS never equals the heights of those two films, but it is a good effort, a fine display of historical spectacle mixed with a three-hander character drama.My main complaint with the film is that it doesn't really know what it wants to be. It starts off as an action flick, but there's only really one notable fight scene in the whole movie. This involves a ferocious battle between two armies, with Jet Li taking to the field and cutting down swathes of the enemy. Extremely tight editing and a refreshing emphasis on the nastiness of warfare makes this scene one of the highlights of the year, but the rest of the film doesn't match it. Soon we move into a more thoughtful, character-led drama that somehow doesn't ring quite true to me. The acting is very good, and the scenes are all well shot with great proficiency in the technical details, but there's a hollowness here that just left me detached from what was going on. It may be that the story is overly familiar, or that some elements – the character of Lian and her relationships with the leads – are glossed over and feel false.I'd say that this is a film that could have been so much more. It marks an admirable move away from the outrageous 'flying' and gravity-defying situations found in the wushu genre, moving towards gritty realism and grimy authenticity. There are a handful of truly great moments, involving some wonderful acting, like the situation with the four thousand prisoners. But the way the film gradually moves away from greatness down to the climax between two individuals is disappointing and feels rushed. Jet Li shines with some of his best acting ever in a couple of places, and Takeshi Kaneshiro is the kind of amiable guy the crowd loves: good looking, fair and just. Andy Lau is also great, but used too little. Overall, it's a case of 'what could have been' rather than 'what is'; nice film, but no classic."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I was fairly certain that this is an average movie. I mean the acting was OK, the sets and props were OK, but bottom line, it was one of those ""everybody cries everybody dies"" movies with the characteristic fast-forward feeling of a Chinese epic script that has to fit a motion picture length. However, a lot of comments here praise it as a great film.I have but one explanation: somewhere between the bad translation, my mood and my ignorance of Chinese history I didn't quite get the idea. But still, this is my comment, therefore I will sum up my own impressions: the femme fatale wasn't even pretty, Jet Li looks old (because he is, not his fault) and one brilliant general cannot be ignorant of politics. But most of all, what was the point of the blood oath? I mean, from then on Jet Li is the elder brother and everyone else listens to him. Was that the point? Then Jet Li was a cold calculated bastard from the start."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Don't you think? I thought this movie was utterly disappointing. I was expecting something extraordinary due to the amazing cast...but this? This was such a letdown.First of all, what's with the 'Lian' character? I don't think she was on-screen enough to be a subplot. But then she keeps popping up now and then so you can't ignore her. She gave such a stone-cold performance I was cringing every time she spoke. It was just...Urgh.When I was leaving the cinema, I was thinking about her role in the movie. She did say she only wanted to act in this movie because of Andy Lau and etc etc...but now that I think about it, if all her scenes were cut, it would've not made any impact on the outcome of the movie. She was just an insignificant little pebble amongst the HUGE boulders surrounding her.Secondly, the characters were a bit 'off'. Something was missing. I kept thinking that Jet Li was double-crossing his 'brothers' in some way, because he had chosen the cowardly way out of war by 'pretending' to die...and it made me think that he was a liar and a cheat. He should've died honourably within the first few minutes of the film so we would be spared of his 'heroic' dialogue for the rest of movie. Then there's Andy Lau. Oh dear. The only scene I liked was when he was chained and screaming for justice. That was pretty emotional. Other than that, oh dear he was such an embarrassment to watch. OH and I've forgotten about Takeshi Kaneshiro. The little teenybopper who was screaming at an obviously-fake head. Sure it was mean to be an act of courage and a display of heroism but I don't think that he really pulled it off. Whenever he laughed/cried it all seemed the same to me. When there were those horrid close-ups, he would smile and cry at the same time. Normally when people do that, they resolve to either smile to cry, not both at the same time. He is a pretty boy, but he needs substance.Finally, the plot was a mess. My mum loved the whole historic feel to it but later I told her that, ""Yes, it has some sort of historic feel to it, but they could've explained it better, rather than skipping here and skipping there with the different armies and such."" I think the script for this movie was a little on the skimpy side. I've got a feeling that chunks of dialogue had been taken out to make sure the movie was short and (probably) concise. A mess. A terrible mess. It was hard to keep up with what was happening.But on the nicer (XD) side of things, the war strategies were great to watch. The men sacrificing themselves, the archers, the action shots. They were great. Oh and my mum LOVES those Steven-Seagul movies where 'justice is served' so she enjoyed it.It just didn't meet my expectations. I was waiting for an epic, not this pile of ill-conceived crap.My rating: 3/10."

After the battle he is taken to a bandit village which is soon attacked by the very army that stood by earlier. He persuades the village leader, Zhao Er-Hu, and his brother to join an army and fight for the people. At first things go well for them and they are successful; they also stand for justice; then they decide that the city of Suzhou must be taken before going on to take Nanking. They think it will take three years but it is five years before Suzhou falls and when it does they are low on food and a rival army is already heading towards Nanking. Pang orders the execution of four thousand captured soldiers even though Ur-Hu promised that they would be spared if the city surrendered. They continue and take Nanking but their friendship is over and Pang is given the governorship of the city by the Empress. The problem is other lords want him to get rid of Er-Hu first.I hadn't heard of this film before seeing it advertised on television; I decided to watch it as I assumed it would be similar to other Chinese films I'd seen such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or 'Hero'; I was wrong about that as the action here was far more realistic; no running up walls or flying across the roof tops here. The battle scenes were still very dramatic though and there was a degree of stylised choreography in the fighting which added to the excitement. I thought actors Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro did good jobs although not speaking Mandarin I can't comment on their accents! While I wouldn't call this a must see film it wasn't bad and is worth watching on television."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"1861: Ching general Pang Qingyun (Jet Li), the only survivor of a bloody battle against the Taiping rebels, falls in with a village of bandits, swearing a blood oath with Zhao Erhu (Andy Lau) and Jiang Wuyang (Takeshi Kaneshiro). Convincing the poor, starving villagers to join the Ching army for a better standard of life (wages, food and a nice uniform), Pang leads his men to victory against the rebels of Shu City, but his next campaigns, to take the cities of Suzhou and Nanking, prove far more challenging, causing the blood brothers to turn on each other. Meanwhile, rival general Ho (boo, hiss!) waits on the sidelines to steal Pang's glory.For anyone with a strong interest in China's history, The Warlords will likely prove to be riveting stuff, director Peter Ho-Sun Chan bringing to life a particularly tumultuous period in the country's history with excellent production design, a strong cast (Li is particularly impressive), and brilliantly handled battle scenes that effectively drive home the brutality of combat. Unfortunately, those with only a passing interest in the political machinations of the period might find the bits between the hacking and impaling of bodies all a bit of a drag after a while: there's lots of talking, scheming, soul-searching, tragedy, crying, and a completely superfluous love triangle, all of which is intended to add substance to the film, but which actually serves to make it a bit of a chore when the blood ain't flying."

The movie was very dramatic and the battle scenes were grand, but that's not enough to make it a good movie. Though it was subtitled, the subtitles weren't a problem; I've watched many excellent subtitled movies (Parasite most recently). There was a lot going on in a foreign place with a history I'm unfamiliar with, so I needed more information than was given."

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"The Warlords (2007) is a movie in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows the Chinese in the 1800s and wars between dynasty's leaving some cities in shambles leading to various bandits and thieves being the norm. Two brothers meet a wanderer and gather as many outlaws like them and form an army that are hired by the dynasties and paid for their attacks and rewarded with food, money and often what they take from the towns they raid. How long can they live this way? This movie is codirected by Peter Ho-Sun Chan (Dragon) and Wai-Man Yip (Lost on Journey) and stars Jet Li (Fong Sai Yuk), Andy Lau (Infernal Affairs), Takeshi Kaneshiro (House of the Flying Daggers) and Jinglei Xu (My Father and I). The storyline for this is very compelling and unique. It shows the struggles of the country and the trickle down effects on families and individuals and how thicker skin is needed to be developed to survive and the importance of toughness, teamwork and trust. The cinematography, settings, attire, props and backdrops were all perfect. The dialogue, writing and acting by the entire cast from beginning to end was also excellent. The action scenes both in terms of big picture war scenes and choreographed individual martial arts sequences were outstanding. This movie is great on a grand scale. I would strongly recommend seeing this film and would score it a 9-9.5/10."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I first thought this was going to be another Chinese war movie with different kingdoms fighting one another for different reasons. Mainly just to conquer and in a way that is what this movie is basically about. But it has certain attributes and direction with the story that makes it more captivating. Plus this doesn't really have over the top fight sequences or super unrealistic kung-fu. In fact the fight sequences is realistic for the most part and it has a story that is actually quite possible. It basically takes a real historical event and goes in a what if it happened this way to reach that point kind a direction. And it actually works for the most part. And the three cast members who are like the three most popular actors in china working today. Really are right for these roles. The plot is basically about three brothers, not by blood but by loyalty and allegiance fighting constant battles. And I seen a lot of these types of movies to know what is going to happen. But certain areas and direction this one takes makes it kinda new in a way. From the three brothers Jet Li plays General Pang a guy that pretended to be dead in order to survive a war. But starts to build courage and his vision. Andy Lau plays Er Hu a leader of a group of bandits that has certain codes and compassion. And Takeshi Kaneshiro plays Wu Pang, he is basically one of the brothers caught in the middle between the other two brothers. Who is both in love with a certain courtesan. But the thing is the love triangle actually is relevant in this movie and blends in with the story. Not a lot but it does have relevance. And the three actors like I said were just right for the roles in this movie, even if Jet Li's small stature makes him look awkward with all the armor he wears in this film. Although most of the way through it's a pretty generic war movie about loyalty and reasons for fighting. But the conclusion actually stands out and makes it, it's own. It's a very watchable war movie and is worth a rent.7.8/10"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Recently we have been hit by a surge of Asian Cinema and historical war epics, The Warlords is one of them and with Jet Li you get some amazing action. Some of the greatest action war scenes i've ever seen were in this film, capturing the raw battle of swords and spears it really hits you.Jet Li puts in an amazing action performance, but also an emotional one also as he plays the role in this film with passion. Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro put in powerhouse performances also, even clashing swords themselves in some amazing set-pieces. The epic scale of the film is evident, in some amazing scenes as you can see thousands of extras as warriors fill the screen.To me The Warlords is just as good as Saving Private Ryan or any other big Hollywood war epics, because it captures the same raw passion of the period of time as well as the amazing fighting styles then. Even the gore and violence is realistic of the time, due to the brutality of the era of warfare. All in all The Warlords is worth seeing for all epic war fans, who want to see some amazing battle scenes.The only issues I had was that it was too short for my liking, and something on such a big epic scale should have been longer."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Review: What an epic movie! I quite enjoyed this deep action movie about 3 warriors who join forces to fight against the Taiping Rebellion. There vow to each other is questioned after certain situations draw the brothers apart, during a time were they don't know who is there friend or there enemy. The storyline was very well put together, but the ending seemed a bit random and unexplainable. The action scenes were epic and very detailed and the backdrop of the whole film was impressive. All of the actors put in a believable performance, especially Jet Li who had some emotional scenes. On the downside, the political side to the movie was a bit confusing but I quite enjoy this big budget spectacular. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is the second movie in my Jet Li series and I can definitely say that he is a versatile actor. Everyone is used to seeing Jet Li using his martial arts to take down his enemies, but this film is based around the war era, so it would have looked a bit odd if he was going around kicking people's butt. The chemistry between the 3 characters was brilliant and the seriousness on Jet Li's face throughout the movie made it intense, especially during the war scenes. I'm becoming a fan of Andy Lau, who starred in movies like the great Shaolin and House Of Flying Daggers and I also liked Takeshi Kaneshiro who plays the other guy in the brotherhood and also starred in House Of Flying Daggers. Anyway, I'm not one that usually likes reading subtitles whilst trying to watch a movie, but they really didn't spoil this well put together film.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $130,000 (What A Flop!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about 3 friends who make a pact to protect each other whilst fighting against the Taiping Rebellion. 7/10"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Chinese cinema at the moment have focused on epic, films set in the past and have become big business, not just in China, but around the world. Chinese cinema has more money in it now, getting bigger stars and having more money for special effects. It is getting better all the time, and challenging their Asian neighbours, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong.The Warlords is set in middle of 19th Century. China is in the middle of the Civil War between the Imperial forces and the Taiping Rebels. The film tells the story of three blood brothers, Pang Qing-Yun (Jet Li), Zhao Er-Hu (Andy Lau) and Jiang Wu-Yang (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who end up forming an army for the Imperial Chinese government. Qing-Yun was a proved general but he was the only survivor of his army after his so-called ally refused to help in a battle. He forms a partnership with the two brothers, Er-Hu and Wu-Yan who are bandits and convinces them to fight for the imperial government. Their army proves to be successful on the battlefield, and Qing-Yun passes on his military philosophies. But the brothers have to content with military politics with a Imperial government that does not like them, and their relationship soars.The film is directed by Peter Chan Ho-Sun, a man who made his reputation as second-unit director, working on films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers. Here he steps up to the director's chair, doing a good job. He plays to his strengths, which is action. The film has strong battle scenes and some kung-fu fights. But as well as action, Chan also focus on the characters, the emotion and politics of the war. The film focuses on political conflicts and the emotional and philosophical divide between Qing-Yun and Er-Hu. Chan knows what he is doing and was not out of his depth.They is a strong cast, with three of China's biggest actors in film. Jet Li is famous for his skills as a material artist, rather then as an actor, but in this film he proves his acting talents with this film. He is a strong actor in this film, doing more then just material arts. Jet Li also give his character depth, mixing both good and evil elements to him. Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro are more established as actors, but also not so well known in the West. Both are good in this film and work well with Jet Li.If you like action films and epics you will enjoy this film. However a little criticism is with the script where it makes out that the rebels properly were the better side to join. But I did enjoy the mix picture it set out instead of a black-and-white world in the rubbish Braveheart. The film is also lacking a real female lead and doesn't play on the love triangle it sets up early in the film. The film does have strong elements involving action, but also about military politics and battlefield ethics.Solid entertainment."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"(This comment was deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report filed by another user) Tau Ming Chong is adapted from a previous Hong Kong film Ci Ma, based on a real historical event.Rather then to tell the story and spoil the interests of reader, I'd like to express some thoughts after watching this film.It is a film intends to tell a story happened between manhood under the historical background of Qing Dynasty, and it is like what Director stated, this film is about the fraternal relation and emotions.General Ma, Xinyi/Pang, Qingyun (Jet Li) is a person who gived in the power, while Yang Er-hu (Andy Lau) has deepest beliefs and passions in fraternity among three and Jiang, Wuyang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) never meant to be a leader and was cheated and stood the wrong side. However, Xu, Jinglei's character - Liansheng, appeared to be very ambiguous and most time accessorial.It revealed that the fraternity can also be very as ugly as darkside of love - cheating, manipulating, betray and adultery. After all, the truth is mostly veiled and even opposited to what are believed."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"In a time of rival warlords fighting over dominion in XIXth Century China - the times the Green Standard Army and the brutal infighting with the Taiping Rebellion - general Pang Qingyun (Jet Li) faces defeat in battle, the sole survivor of a brutal bloody battle. Devastating by this occurrence Pang seeks refuge in a nearby village, finding momentary solace in the arms of Liangsheng (Xu Jinglei), the wife of a local Robin Hood-esque bandit Zhao Erhu (Andy Lau). Not dedicated to any faction, save the well-being of his people Zhao Erhu and his comrade in arms Jiang Wuyang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) raid random forces in search of wares and food, which has been stripped from surrounding communities for war efforts. In awe of Pang's fighting skills, the bandits bring him into their fold, soon forming a close affinity to the general-deserter. However an influx of new forces brings about the necessity to chose a side and Pang convinces the renegades to sign on to the Qing army. Bound together by a blood pact Pang, Erhu and Wuyang create an unstoppable trio, who despite towering odds of opposition always manage to reign victorious. Nonetheless, Pang's Macchiavelian approach (anything goes for a just cause) and categorical logic to war result in an internal moral conflict between the eternally connected companions...As usual in modern big-budget features, ""Warlords"" are lavishly shot and portrayed, however the novelty of Chinese blockbusters has admittedly start to wear off, forcing the mind to look past the exterior perfection. Much more gritty and visceral than typical such fare, ""Warlords"" poses questions regarding the beauty of war, instead focusing much attention to the inglorious nature of blood spiltd, lives lost and morality subverted. Natural heroic pathos still reigns supreme, but question marks are given as to the correct path of action during various troublesome scenarios, while the brutal tragicality of battles is not spared from the audience. Despite the somewhat melodramatic tension created by the director, the overall backdrop is anything but soapish, instead stark and gruesome.The most memorable scene being a depiction of a fallen comrade broken and dying in agony on a battlefield, while soldiers painfully wincing in ditches can do nothing but listen to the cursing tirades of their former friend. These brief unmitigated moments help gloss over the underwhelming dramaturgy between the blood brothers, who fail to really breathe each other space, instead offering a bland interaction. Somewhat surprising given the immense cast of Andy Lau, Jet Li and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Thankfully however ""Warlords"" mostly avoids drawn out slow-motioned sequences aimed at underscoring drama, something that has become something of a instrumental scourge of modern Chinese epics, where most directors fail to find enough restraint and tact, when utilising this dramatic technique."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Ever since Hollywood fumbled several golden opportunities to capitalize on the success of Gladiator and revive the fortunes of the historical epic in the West, it's good to see Asian cinema taking up the ball and running with it so effectively. And it's a testament to the scope of what's on offer these days that a film like The Warlords is in the middle of the pack.There are several things The Warlords does right: 1. It restricts the scope of its story, keeping a tight focus on the three heroes, their struggles with circumstance and with enemies that include the conniving Mandarins of the Qing court and the soldiers-of-fortune they favor. The Warlords doesn't try to deliver a history lesson on the incredibly complex topic of the Taiping Rebellion, and establishes the Taipings themselves in subtle, minimal strokes; it's nice if you know the history behind their long locks and crucifixes, but you don't need to know it to understand the flow of the film. What's in frame is what we need to know: the desperation that drove many to take up arms in the China of the day, the shocking straits the Imperial forces had been reduced to, and the kind of inspiration, improvisation and daring it took on the battlefield to bring the Dynasty back from the brink of oblivion.2. It keeps the action varied. No wire-work, thank God, and the battle scenes are gritty, dirty and bloody. We do get treated to some awe-inspiring set pieces, a couple of classic Jet Li throwdowns, and a surprisingly vivid and memorable death scene by a Taiping general that sets the stage for a fatal breach among the trio of sworn brothers. War can become mind-numbing and repetitive, but the film doesn't.3. It doesn't get schmaltzy. There's a romantic subplot, but the filmmakers resist the temptation to let it take over the proceedings and play it out subtly in a succession of guilty glances and stolen moments. The focus is, as it should be, on the the three brothers and especially General Pang as they struggle to adapt to chaotic events and stay afloat in the stormy waters of war and court politics. And when the love triangle does come into play, it does so in an unexpected way.The Warlord's plot is serviceable and engaging, if nothing fancy. That the three brothers are headed for a falling-out is obvious even before they take their blood oath, but the path of that falling-out isn't predictable. In terms of dialogue, there's nothing mind-blowing and nothing intolerably bad. Performances are excellent, and in particular all three of the leading actors deliver in spades. It makes for worthwhile and enjoyable viewing."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Been a while since I have seen a so-called ""serious"" movie and been able to recommend it as worth watching without disclaimers or reservations.Finally The Warlords is here. While it is not an all-time classic it finally blends the right amount of serious info, historical accuracy, quality acting and plot lines in with some worthwhile action scenes.The Warlords starts off with a battle more bloody, graphic and realistic than any Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, Gladiator, even the LOTR films. In fact anything since Braveheart, Jet Li is the only survivor of the carnage, and he looks a lot worse for wear.We find his name is Pang, and he comes across a kindly stranger and tells his story, he was a member of the army built to put down the rebel forces, only at the time most needed the ""parent"" army called the Ho army, sold them out and decided not to fight, leaving them to be slaughtered.As a result a disillusioned Pang has deserted the army once and for all.After he recovers Pang is in town looking for food when a rebel named Wu-Yang tries to steal his army issued boots, after Pang (of course) rolls him, the guy says ""tag along with me and I'll introduce you to my boss, he'll love ya."" In subtitles at least.Once Pang meets the boss named Er-Hu, he is told ""We don't need you thanks, but stay the night, party with us and you can leave in the morning."" But over that one night two things happen: Pang finds out that Er-Hu's missus Lian actually shares an intimate past with him, and the rebels are attacked by the Ho army.After the attack Pang urges Er-Hu to join the army for protection, food and safety, as rebels and thieves are the lowest form of life to the public, and their deaths would be welcomed by society. Before agreeing to sign up, Er-Hu and Wu-Yang demand that Pang take a brotherhood oath, they must protect one another at any cost, and any brother that does not or harms another brother is to be killed.He agrees and they enter the army, starting by attacking the Ho's as a sign of loyalty. This initial success leads the army leaders to bestow greater power and responsibility to Pang and friends, and they form a unit to take on a Ho-held city stronghold. This leads to the centrepiece of the film, a major battle that develops and unfolds in dramatic and effective fashion, while also showing the bond building between the three ""brothers"".Once Pang delivers the good news to his superiors, he is given greater responsibility, and his true aspirations become more clear.Over time Pang gets harder, Wu-Yang grows up and realises that War is heck, and Er-Hu rethinks the sheer scope of the situation, and all the while Lian is caught in the middle.What ensues is a running 5 year battle between the Pang lead forces and the Ho army, with minimal assistance from Pang's leaders. The Ho's actively resist their advances, while the leaders, wary of Pang's growing power and influence, plan his downfall for fear that he may soon turn on them.So in true Major League fashion, Pand decides ""Let's just win the whole f*ckin' thing!"" This is a historical drama that you can watch without fear that you might learn something (though you might), it is entertaining, has great fight scenes, solid acting and moves along at a pace that allows you to remain interested without just treading water between fight scenes.Jet Li proves that he is a commanding presence, and although I didn't remember the names the guys who play Wu-Yang and Er-Hu are both good too. There is one particular scene in which tension runs high, which ultimately creates a rift in the brotherhood and may cause you to seriously consider which side you would align with.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Ignore the subtitles, this is better than most in the genre, and the (admittedly CGI assisted) fight scenes are huge in scope and in realism.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"An epic and tragic story of three blood (sworn) brothers, Warlords is indeed worth watching.This movie opens up with a realistic war scene and the classic ""brotherhood"" moments which is a strong theme in most of Chinese's literature and cinema throughout the ages.You would see a good war scenes almost every time. Those who enjoy reading arts of war, Romance of Three Kingdoms or other classic war-themed story or those who simply loves Dynasty Warriors would grit their teeth and smile in victory in observing the characters' actions in various scenes.In the latter part of the movie, you would see the brotherhood of the 3 main characters shattered by Jet Li's ambitions, Andy Lau's sense of righteousness and Takeshi Kaneshiro's innocent judgment. The three actors play their role well, as expected.This movie also has the plus point of not exaggerating itself with nudity or women with sexy robes and unnecessary sex scenes, unlike some other movies which has the same theme with Warlords. Thus, Warlords does not seducing western viewers in a wrong way. The cinematography is humble. However, it has a lot of realistic and pretty gory war scenes which make it a cool movie to watch. Warlords is not really a wuxia movies, since the (non-war) fighting scenes are mostly simple and short.All and all, Warlords does not have extraordinary music and the scenes are not emotional and enticing enough. One's feeling wold not really feel the character's sadness, anger, depression, etc because of the lack of beautiful music and cinematography scheme (unlike the exquisite Zhang Yimou's ""Ying Xiong""). Fortunately, the three main leads deliver such beautiful acting and their expressions it selves represent the movie's emotions very well.This movie would not disappoint most people, especially when you enjoy good and realistic war-scenes, some plot twists, and heartbreaking moments which this movie has."

This movie provide 3 legendary actors and used 40 M Dollar. I wonder how much they paid those expensive actors. Nevertheless, they showed the best performance so the money will not be a loss. To be honest, after watching this film, i admire them much more! Finally, i was delighted that this movie could show good capability to challenge the dominating Hollywood movie.

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"This is a very powerful movie full of emotion, but there is one problem that held it back. It was the story. The movie was almost 2 hours and it still was rushed. Scenes would go by too fast or it would skip to another scene and you didn't feel like the one before it was complete. A rushed story can really ruin a movie. Some things did save the film though. The cast for one thing. Jet Li was great and had somewhat of an evil side to him. Now this is not an action packed movie, so don't expect to see Jet Li go wild. But there is one scene in the beginning where he fights and it is pretty intense. He makes a blood brother pack with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. Andy Lau is probably the actor who showed the most emotion. One scene he was so full of emotion, you couldn't cut it with a knife. Takeshi Kaneshiro was more of the young hot shot and near the end finally grows up. Xu Jinglei plays the love interest of Jet Li and Andy Lau. She was also a pleasure to watch. So again, the film was full of emotion and some of the camera angles plus the visuals were really intense. I just really wish the story was more solid and they really could of had something here."

The overall tone of the post-production is rather gray to match the tone.Ultimately, this movie belongs to that small set of flicks that I'm not exactly sorry I watched, but never really want to see again.

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I know some of the actors in this movie speak English. I hate watching movies with sub titles. I will not be caught reading a subtitle when the scene charges and I miss seeing someone's expression, or some piece of action, all because I had to read the sub title.OK, I admit I'm not the fastest reader in the world, but any way you want to cut it, I hate sub titles.So, when I put the audio on English, I was surprised to hear some guys voice in place of Jet Li's voice. I have never had any problems with his acting and I was looking forward to this movie, however hearing someone else's voice coming out of Jet Li is just disturbing. I know he has an Asian accent, however I have never been one to fault an actor just because he has an accent. And, IMHO, an actor from another country SHOULD have an accent.The movie itself is pretty good. Fairly epic. The story was pretty good, and over all the budget was great. No problems suspending disbelief here. It was even a little gory (cool).Worth the $15 I payed for it. It's just too bad Jet Li didn't provide the voice for his character. I have seen a few movies where Jackie Chan did his own dubbing, and they were much better in that respect.However, even with my one beef, this is still a good movie and I enjoyed watching it."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"I finally saw this movie. I thought of giving it a miss when I see the trailer with scenes of messy action(like Chat Gim) and Andy's poor acting scenes. But then, I was curious as it compared to the original Blood Brothers. Friends said it was not that bad and the box office success in HK told me that it can't be as bad as Tsui Hark's last wuxia Seven Swords.Compared to Blood Brothers(70s) the director gave this movie more budget and grand, a bigger scale story with war and politics thrown in, while the original simply concentrated on the well drafted 2 triangular affairs .Briefly and as usual, I will just highlight the flaws. I am sure praises and pleases are already in abundant.a) The opening intro did not make the opening and action scenes clear. Those without knowledge of Chinese history may find the opening confusing.b) In the scene when Jet Li has part of a spear pierced through his shoulder, it is not straight.c) Near the end when Jet Li got his men to trick Andy for a meeting to assassinate him and Takeshi tried to save him, the audience don't understand their direction and locations.d) The most serious flaw in the movie is the script on the triangular affair. In olden Chinese days, a wife don't get to leave his house without the husband knowing and consent. Here, we see the female lead left the house twice when the husband just came home from far and it was not shown or explained or how the husband could not know about it.e) The wife affair with Jet Li was also non-logical. The first time, the lady approached him(in bed) and when they can meet again, Let Li avoided him by staying out of the village. The lady ran all the way to look for him but turn back when he found his main door closed(not logic). Yet, the 3rd time they met, it's Jet Li's turn to go after her while she tried to run away. Their affairs just don't seems logic. The plot will be more convincing if it showed either one party had been more persistent all the way.f) As usual, Andy Lau can never act well. Out of the 3, he has the most flaws, especially in scenes when he is supposed to act fierce and strong. His facial expression gave way and looks comical. Surprisingly Takeshi turned out the best.Overall the movie is still worth a few dollars and 2 hours. Remind me of the rubbish Seven Swords(Chat Gim) but this is far better in action, acting, script, story and direction."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen, by far the best performance I have seen from Jet Li. He and this film were well worthy of their Hong Kong Film Award victories and nominations. The acting and emotion were strong throughout the movie and you could feel the pain and anguish of the characters in those moments.The script at times (or perhaps the direction) didn't seem to fit with jumping ahead in some situations, but that didn't hurt the grand feel of the film too much. Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro also were incredible, each had their opportunity to show their talent and definitely delivered.Jinglei Xu had a very powerful scene at the beginning of the movie and a few other portions where she masterfully used her face to tell a story without dialogue. All the acting was top notch and the story was definitely gripping. If you want to see Jet Li at his best you should definitely give this film a watch."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Peter Chan Ho-sun's ""The Warlords"" (2007) has the strongest cast of Chinese films, the three kings (Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro) and the queen (Xu Jinglei), plus the serious production of war scenes, although war films have never been the darling of the Hong Kong box office, but this film' promotion cleverly avoided the war film format, and advertised that the film was about the brotherhood of the three male protagonists. In the brotherhood written by Peter Chan Ho-sun this time, many of the characters in the classic masterpiece ""Water Margin"", such as Pang Qingyun played by Jet Li, have the shadow of Song Jiang. Brothers can ""share weal and woe"", and fight the world together. After gaining the world, ""brothers can kill each other"" for various reasons. The ugliness of human nature is fully revealed in ""sharing wealth and honor"" at that moment. More than that, there are heavier ideals of disillusionment and value collapse.In the description of the brotherhood of the three protagonists, Peter Chan Ho-sun does not focus much on the fraternity of the three protagonists. He concentrates on the cruelty of the war and the political conspiracy of the Qing Dynasty behind it. Many comments express their appreciation for Peter Chan Ho-sun involvement in the political conspiracy, which makes the film's the connotation and pattern have been improved, which is also the biggest difference between ""The Warlords"" and Chang Cheh's ""Dynasty of Blood"", Ti Lung in ""Dynasty of Blood"" killed his brother Chen Kuan-tai for fame, fortune and women. Power and lust dominate human nature, and David Chiang's revenge is simple and reasonable.But Jet Li of ""The Warloads"" is a general (Pang Qingyun) who has experienced the brink of death. He cried bitterly in front of Liansheng (Xu Jinglei played), a strange woman he met for the first time. In Jiang Wuyang's (Takeshi Kaneshiro palyed) monologue, Pang Qingyun said that he was a ""dead person"", he advised Zhao Erhu (Andy Lau played) and Jiang Wuyang to join the Qing Dynasty. There is a set of ideals behind it to change the world. In the end, for the ""ideal"", he killed all the soldiers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom who surrendered in Nanjing, which made Zhao Erhu question the so-called ""ideal"" of the eldest brother (Pang), and the friendship between the two began to crack. Jiang Wuyang understood Pang Qingyun's decision, but he couldn't fully agree with him. When he ordered ""shoot arrows"", he muttered to himself, ""Big Brother (Pang) is right"" to forcibly anesthetize his ""violence"". In the middle of Pang Qingyun and Zhao Erhu, in the end, he thought that Pang Qingyun killed Zhao Erhu because of the adultery between Pang Qingyun and sister-in-law Liansheng. Jiang Wuyang killed Liansheng who was regarded as his sister, and assassinated Pang Qingyun to avenge Zhao Erhu. It was not a simple act of revenge, infiltrated the trust in Pang Qingyun and Liansheng, unable to face the cruelty of human nature in reality, especially in the values of Pang Qingyun and Zhao Erhu, he chose the former, agreeing with Pang Qingyun's ""ideal"" to change the world, and finally this value is collapsed because of Pang Qingyun and Liansheng betrayed Zhao Erhu, assassination is more of a vent for shattered ideals and denial of self-worth than revenge, but the film does not have enough space to describe this complex emotion. And Pang Qingyun, facing the darkness of officialdom, asked him to kill Zhao Erhu with his own hands. His ""ideal"" is no match for the black hole of political darkness, so he has a tendency to self-destruct in the face of Jiang Wuyang's assassination.In Jiang Wuyang's monologue, Pang Qingyun mentioned that Pang Qingyun did not believe in the feudal act of ""proof of allegiance"" (the Chinese title). He only believed in Zhao Erhu and Jiang Wuyang, but about how the three of them established the friendship, except for their death on the battlefield, there is not much description, especially it is Zhao Erhu's identification and trust in Pang Qingyun's ""ideal"". Whether Pang Qingyun used the two brothers to fulfill his so-called ""ideal"" or fought with them to build friendship, it seems quite confusing. However, Peter Chan Ho-sun connected this film with one siege after another, and told a story with a simple plot as beautifully and touchingly that it is a master work.By Kam Po LAM (original in Chinese)"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"This is a true story about War that had ever happened in China. 70 million people were dead during the war which was nearly similar to what happened in World War Two.People were struggling to find food for living. Some of them stole food and became bandits. Cao Er Hu (Andy Lau) and Chang Wen-Xiang (Takeshi Kaneshiro) were the head of a small group of bandits (their men power were approximately only 800 men and teen boy).General Ma-Xin Yi (Jet-Li), were the only survivor in a battle. He lost all of his troops and brothers. He met a woman who gave him a shelter for one night and fell in love with this woman, who soon after wards was found out to be Cao Er Hu's wife.He helped Chang Wen-Xiang and Cao Er Hu in conquering an army that were passing by their area. And then they became brothers.We can see in this movie that Ma Xin Yi (Jet-Li) is truly excellent in martial arts, and he was the eldest of the three brothers. Soon after Ma Xin Yi (Jet Li) persuaded Cao Er Hu and Chang Wen Xiang to join army instead of being bandits. We would see how ambitious Ma-Xin Yi really was. He was risking his life and troops which consists only hundreds of men, trying to conquer cities Shu, Suchou, that had armies a lot more than his army. At the end Ma Xin Yi finally achieved a very high status, but he also lost his relationship with his brothers which he should actually value the most."

But it's really annoying to hear everybody claiming it's such an antiwar movie.. bla, bla, bla.. No, it is not. The moral between the lines is rotten.. sorry. And no, do not dare to compare it with ""Apocalypse Now""... Jeez what's wrong with you people....? Read some Camus, Nietzsche or even Dostojewskji to get an opinion on such a topic (Yes, they all broached the issue of war).This is just a statement, skipping the essential need to deliver arguments to support it. I know. You take the next step and do the thinking yourself ;-)Give it an 8 for the entertainment. But a 3 for the actual moral, educational.... value."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"Read some of the comments and my feeling is that nobody gets the idea right. Let's start from the question: why Pang Qingyun(Jet Li) betrayed his brothers?* Because of the poor looking Lian(Xu Jinglei)? Maybe. At the beginning of the movie, Pang and Lian developed kind of patient-nurse + one night stand relationship. Apparently they maintain the relationship and further extend it. It could be a good cause in a 3rd rate production.* Because of the potential political competition among the three brothers? Maybe. Around the 3/4 of the movie, after the three brothers successfully swept Taiping Rebellion in NanJing, the back stage political bosses want balance. It could be a reasonable explanation for a conspiracy theory movie.* My explanation is the ambition of Pang. Don't get me wrong. The ambition is about bring back peaceful lives back to normal people. He is willing to sacrifice his two blood-oath brothers for the general good of his people. I guess it's something westerners can't easily understand. Who authorizes him to sacrifice his brothers, thousands of POW, and even himself for some vague idea of ""people""? This movie serves a good footnote for the Hero (directed by Zhang Yimou). In both movies, the directors tried to tell stories from a very Chinese eyes: heroes are those who sacrifice for something huge: the unification of China, and basic living of common people. As Chinese, i feel they are more worthy of dying for than freedom, human right, etc."

Secondly, I'm a pessimistic, so if you're not into painful truths go look at the previous goody-goody reviews. (thanks:))here goes,.. This was my first Chinese Movie (watched on cinema), don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Jet Li's (Once Upon A Time In China, Swordsman + etc), Jackie Chan's and Stephen Chow's movies! (watched on TV, DVD's, VHS)But this is nowhere near blockbuster! (except for the scenes and budget maybe?) I was so badly disappointed (reviews were totally wrong!!)I am confident that the reviewers (TV, Magazines etc) support local (Singaporean Production) therefore they con the general public and give good ratings and applaud out loud!yes, the moment I saw the first part of this film I knew I was 100% sure I was gonna hate it. Why? well with bad movie direction, mediocre acting, predictable lines and badly acted scenes. If you truly enjoy a good movie and realistic artistry do not watch this!On the other hand, if you're just bored and have nothing else to do and wish to catch heroes fighting and crying and a movie with a dry love chemistry and you have poor taste in movies (or don't care much about details) then have fun and watch it. heck, you might even totally disagree with this review :)anyways... spoofs from other (Western) movies :There were scenes which mimicked The Matrix (Jet Li bashing the bad guys), along with The Gladiator's victory music, this was too much! (to the point where I kicked my partner's leg because i just couldn't take it anymore!) (it was played twice but with Chinese additional music to cover it up!), and there were also some scenes copied from 300 (fight and cheer on soldiers!) I felt cheated because I really thought Jet Li + Takeshi was gonna be awesome, but instead the film literally looked like it was directed by an amateur callow director, I think they just agreed to act because they were given big bucks! Boo~!This will be the only Chinese (+ local) movie I'm gonna watch! since Raintree copied the Iranian movie and became super-rich, I have no admiration for them at all. As you can see, I can go on and on about how bad this movie is but I'll just stop here.Thank you for reading, so in the end, don't watch it! :) it will help you save 2 hours worth of quality time! well, if you're so hellbent on watching, go ahead then (just not on cinema)"
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"This movie is a great achievement for HK cinema, specifically, its historical based war branch. The plot is sensible with mostly logical steps towards the ending. The acting is acceptable with only few terrible segment of overacting, mostly from Takeshi, who just doesn't sell his part that well. This movie probably would have been a ten if all of the case were from the mainland, but hey they got to sell tickets. In short, if you enjoyed films such as,Saving private Ryan, Gladiator, Brave Heart, or Warrior, you'll enjoy this realistic Chinese epic of the turmoil during the Taiping Rebellion."
投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"The war sequence is amazing. It's full of brute force and shows the desperation of the soldiers. It is very realistic, just more dramatic. There are a lots lots of extras. Perhaps it's the first time I had seen that the war sequence represents the numbers of casualties mentioned. The war and fight is fast, it doesn't look choreographed. Instead, it looks violent and brutal.Jet Li gives decent acting here. Andy Lau got great role he deserved unlike in ""House of Flying Daggers."" Any Lau fans could tell he gave different performance this time. With all the blood, violence, brotherhood, man pride, and politics, I could say, a very ""masculine"" film."

Maybe in Asia this is considered a masterpiece and their standards, much lower than ours in western world. Or maybe they just had budget constraints. I don't know.Contrary to its title, there is only really one battle scene and the fighting, too stylistic to seem real. There is no clear objective in terms of storyline. After the battle scene in the middle it slowly winds down until it eventually dies, the characters pull away at which point it doesn't seem to matter because your interest has died with it.

投名状,The Warlords (2007),,2007,2010.04.02,"This is just such a great movie on so many levels. The acting is superb, the cast is wonderful, the screenplay is impeccable. But what's really striking about the movie is that it never takes the easy path, to tell an easy-cheesy hero melodrama story that seems almost guaranteed in such an ""epic"" setting nowadays: ancient China, blood oath of brotherhood, Kongfu and swordplay, etc. (sounds familiar?)Instead, the movie keeps hitting you with one moral dilemma after another at every turn of the plot. It not only shows you the process of General Pang losing his last shred of humanity and becoming a monster, but at the same time presents the audience with the difficult choices that drive him through it, which makes the audience can't help but somehow empathize with him and question whether he is really that wrong? That is what makes this movie so emotionally powerful and intellectually tasteful.To me personally, this is a movie of demagogues, an epitome of the Chinese politics of the last century. General Pang always reminds me of Chairman Mao. Both are great military leaders, yet greater demagogues who use war and trickery to satisfy their personal cravings for powers, and masterfully manipulate people's longing for morality and prosperity and turn them into barbarians and monsters. Maybe it's just me, but as a fellow Chinese, I can't help but suspect that Director Chen might have the same thing in mind."

唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Unfortunately this movie looks a lot better in the trailer than it actually is. I'm giving it points for defying expectations but essentially this is a big flop of a movie. The narrative is unconventional to say the least. It spends a staggering 30minutes introducing three serious douchebags. One American, two Chileans. Not explained how they came to be roving around Chile, but they have money and not a lot of responsibility. You would imagine that after thirty minutes these guys are going to be the major characters. Surprise! Only one of these guys survives any distance into the disaster and during the latter half of the movie the main characters are three girls who are considerably less fleshed out than the guys we met first off.That's not the only narrative flaw. Why is there such an effort made to introduce the girl with the wu-tang tattoo. Is she going to feature in the rest of the film? Nope. Are any of the character backgrounds actually important to the story or how they act under pressure? Not really. How come during the cable car crash (whatever it is) a crowded street suddenly becomes utterly deserted? I guess the main purpose of this story is to show us that during a disaster death comes randomly, even to people who think they are the lead characters."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This is my first review and will try to keep it as short as possible because, hating to bust on any aspiring authors or critics out there most of us don't read the long reviews. There's no need to write a 2,000 word synopsis on any movie,show or whatever here, IMDb already does that for us. We just wanna know if it's any good or not.... oops I guess there goes keeping this short.Anyways, I just watched it this morning so while it's fresh in my mind, is this movie any good?If you like horror, action and/or adventure (along the line of Jaws, though this is no Jaws) you might enjoy this. It has its action, experiencing and trying to escape the earthquake. It's got its scary, borderline intense moments of terror and lots'a blood n' gore. Oh yeah and bonus, some annoying hipsters get killed! Add in a couple of ""didn't see that coming"" plot twists, a fun ending and you may start moving towards the edge of your seat but, I don't think you'll make it all the way there.Bottom line, it's not a particularly moving piece of cinema but,if you got an hour and a half to kill and you're not paying for it (like me I caught it on cable) It's still better than a lot of the other crap I've seen lately on TV so it's coming in at a solid, watchable but not earth-shaking 6"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Ahhhh Chile. The women, the night life, the gorgeous greenery of the  terrain. Chile is beautiful country. That is partly why American Gringo  (Eli Roth) and pals Ariel (Ariel Levy) and Pollo (Nicolas Martinez)  love it so much. Their adventures in Chile would be the envy of any  man. And when the trio hook up with three smoking hot women, Kylie,  Irina and Monica (Lorenza Izzo, Natasha Yarovenko and Andrea Osvart,  respectively), the whole potential adventure fun meter goes off the  chart.  The six friends find themselves having such a good time that they agree  to all travel together to the coastal town of Valparaiso. As the night  becomes early morning, the group find themselves enjoying the dance  clubs the city has to offer. But their night of reckless unabandon  turns into terror when an 8.8 magnitude earthquake hits the city  turning their paradise into a mound of death and ruins where our  protagonists must survive everything from looters, escaped convicts and  the constant aftershocks in the earthquake's wake.  Aftershock is written and directed by Nicolás López (Eli Roth takes a  co-writing credit) who uses true stories of the real 8.8 magnitude  earthquake that hit Chile in 2010 as the basis for his survival film.  Shot in Chile, many of the scenes were set in areas that still remain  in ruin after the powerful disaster. This gives an authentic and  realism feel to a film that is as hard to believe as it would be as  plausible to accept.  The first half of the film is a disaster movie true and true. We spend  a good time getting to know our characters and I would suggest that  knowing Eli Roth was involved will give audiences the patience in  knowing that the set up is worth the pay off. When the earthquake hits,  the chaos begins and bodies (and their parts) are thrown around screen  in wild grotesqueness. As the six main characters attempt to escape  onto the street, the devastation engulfs them. But they must quickly  gather themselves in fear of a tsunami warning that is ringing  throughout the city.  Running, screaming and reacting to the city in ruins takes us to past  the half way mark of Aftershock. But then director López switches gears  and Aftershock becomes a horror movie with evil characters and murders  rampaging through the streets in search of women and blood.  The script penned by López and Roth continues to surprise throughout.  Every death comes as a shock and how they pass is even more shocking.  Don't bother guessing who will survive as the script has no  'untouchables' and everyone is fair game.  Eli Roth accepts his first top billing role and plays the nerd, gringo  perfectly. Bloodsoaked and searching for safe haven, he is the  personality that propels the first quarter of the film only to pass off  his full frame attention to actor Nicolás Martínez and the rest of the  surviving team.  There are plenty of Roth-isms to be found in Aftershock. The violence  and gore is violent and gory. People are impaled, burned, shot and  murdered with axes. And the final scene was something that we are sure  Eli had his hands all over relishing in the idea of closure.  Aftershock was a crowd favorite at the Toronto International Film  Festival Midnight Madness showing and it is easy to see why. Fans get a  bit of everything  parts disaster movie, parts horror, parts thriller,  parts titillating comedy. We enjoyed ourselves immensely in the  adventure. We were involved enough with our characters that didn't care  that it switched focus (and genre's) halfway through. We are just glad  that we survived the screening and we can't wait to watch it again.  A result of the word-of-mouth at the festival got Aftershock a  distribution deal with Dimension Films. No release date has been set,  but you can expect to see Aftershock hit theatres before long."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The title ""Aftershock"" alone will make you expect it is about an earthquake. However, for the first thirty minutes or so, you are only uselessly following a group of three friends and ladies they pick up as they go around Valparaiso, you'd think you were in the wrong movie. However, this earthquake does come when you least expect it. Then, the disaster movie goes into another radically different territory. It becomes a horror film where all the characters get killed off one by one in a way more grisly than the one before. This film does not shy away from blood or bad logic, folks!With a story line like this, it really caters to a very limited audience - those who like to see the worst of human nature come out after a natural calamity. Fans of gore and sadism though may actually enjoy watching this awful film. I am giving it a star only for its final scene, which was well-shot, even though I totally saw it coming."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I would not call this a horror film. A dark disaster film is more appropriate. The film is fun, lively and well done and acted. If not for a oddly timed and inappropriate character reveal that just makes you scratch your head and go huh? It was fun. The reveal was not even needed, especially when it did happen. It literally took me out of the film until it was resolved. If your looking for something on the dark end, with horror type feel then check it out. It was good. It flowed really well and made sense how the characters got from one place to another. Well structured and honest."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The film starts with nightclubs, something that looks like a rave, broken marriage, and a pointless and awkward Selena Gomez cameo. There were plenty of self-regarding, shallow, parasitic, non-working idiots who exhibit plenty of class hatred for anyone except themselves.The quake occurred while the stars were in a nightclub deep underground. They escape only because one of them had shown a few moments of decency. The surface was not much better. Their transportation was rendered scrap. Their cell phones do not work since the repeaters were down.The tsunami alarm goes off. They head for higher ground, as did so many other people.They encounter gangs of murdering thugs and bad luck, the kind one dies from.The aftershocks make things much, much worse.----Scores----Cinematography: 10/10 Absolutely wonderful.Sound: 10/10 Lovely.Acting: 2/10 Eli Roth was just terrible. I hope he quits acting altogether, and gets out of writing and producing. Nicolas Martinez was often enjoyable. Ariel Levy was wretchedly bad. The actresses who played the half-sisters were quite annoying.Screenplay: 8/10 The beginning was too long; I was ready for the stars to begin getting hammered by nature after about three minutes. Instead it was about 35 minutes. After the lengthy introduction, I hoped all of them would die horribly. So I guess the screenplay was a success up to the point of the earthquake. The stars get shredded thereafter with a very small number of survivors, until the tsunami finally shows up in the end. The screenplay did succeed at its objectives."

唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Dead babies, a double rape and painfully brutal deaths are how I'm going to describe this bizarre hot mess of a film. Aftershock was nothing at all like I was expecting, especially coming from a project involving Eli Roth. I think I'm going to have to make peace with the fact that Roth will not be making quality horror films like Hostel or even Cabin Fever anymore. I'm going to have to settle for cheap thrills and depravity galore! Aftershock is a really bad film, but I still found myself gasping, cheering and gagging through out the hour. I say hour because the first 30 minutes are completely worthless. Once you get through the first pointless 30 minutes of lameness, and I did time it for your consideration, then it turns into a terrifying hour of low budget looking gore, cheesy drama, bad music and some of the most terrifying ways to die since Final Destination. Then there were the scenes that were just pure shock value, hence the uncomfortable rape scene and multiple dead baby scenes. But, I willingly made it to the end and found myself feeling terrified during all of the death scenes. Bottom line, utterly disappointed, but still found it mediocrely entertaining.Please like me on Facebook!

Gringo, played by Eli Roth, is a responsible, newly single American father trying his best to fit in as Ariel and Pollo guide him around underground nightclubs in search for women. After meeting three woman who seem perfectly matched for these three men, a massive earthquake hits. The party stops and a battle for survival begins.The first 30 minutes consist of watching the three main actors drink heavily while making their way around Chile. This is another one of those films wherein the actors seem to be having so much fun on-screen, it is as if they forget there is an audience who have paid to be entertained by the film they have found themselves in. The film itself has the production value of a movie made for a cable television network and while there is comedy, the humor is at the level of a bad sitcom. When the earthquake finally does happen the story tries to be as shocking as possible making it unclear whether or not the director was intentionally trying to add a level of comedy to the horror. Either way, Aftershock fails."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I read a so - so review of this film in the L.A. Weekly and several things caught my attention. Im not sure what movie the reviewer saw but it definitely was not ""Aftershock"". Not sure if main stream reviewers find it necessary to destroy anything that goes against the grain. As far as this picture is concerned, all I have to say is ""GO SEE IT!!"". It an incredible film with some very real scenarios about things that would really happen would there be an aftershock in a country say... Chile... or any other country for that matter where such an enormous disaster would cause social turmoil. The characters were real and the situations were even more intense leaving the audience fixed to their seats until the very bitter end. Unfortunately when I went to see this film, there were only three or four cats in the five o clock showing of this film on a Saturday...not good. But then, a lot of these great films are not getting the chance and exposure needed to succeed in an already over saturated marketplace. However, I do highly recommend you give this film a chance. It will grip you and toss you around like a bad ass roller coaster ride..so with that said... enjoy the show!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Aftershock (2012) * (out of 4) Set in Santiago, Chile, a group of people are traveling around partying and having a good time but that all changes when an earthquake rips the city apart. The worse has yet to happen because soon a group of people find themselves being tortured by a gang of escaped cons. EARTHQUAKE meets THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is pretty much the only way to describe this awful movie that starts off bad and just gets worse as it goes along. Director Nicolas Lopez co-wrote the screenplay with Roth and it's clear that neither of them had much to say as there's really no story to be found here, horrible dialogue and absolutely no character development. What we basically have is thirty-minutes of partying, thirty-minutes of the earthquake stuff and then about twenty-minutes worth of violence. The entire film is just so pointless that for the life of me I can understand how this thing actually got a theatrical release. The performances are all pretty forgettable but you really can't blame the cast because they were given nothing to do. I really do mean that nothing happens in this film. There's a big twist at the end that you'll see coming from a mile away. None of the characters are likable so I'm not sure why the writers decided to make them so hate-able. Did they want us to enjoy seeing them tortured? Perhaps but even the death/torture/rape scenes are so tame and boring that they add nothing to the picture. The special effects aren't believable during the earthquake scenes so there's yet another thing that doesn't work. The only thing that keeps AFTERSHOCK mildly entertaining is that you keep sitting there thinking that something's eventually going to happen so you hand onto hope that things are going to get better. Sadly, they never do as the picture just continues to get worse and it leads up to a very lame climax. I'm really not sure what the point of this was unless Lopez and Roth just thought it would be cool to mix the disaster and rape/revenge genres. Either way this here is a complete misfire that should be avoided."

The Movie does not even have any message, Words of morality/wisdom which is so clear in the simplest of Movies, even Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D has one.

唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"On their last night out a group of travellers find themselves fighting for survival when an earthquake devastates South America. Probably due to an abundance of sub-par modern style horrors debatably 2012's Aftershock is sorely underrated and overlooked. Reminiscent of the character build up that came with Eli Roth's own Hostel director Nicolás López delivers a hard hitting freely traditionally shot (no found footage here) well executed, gritty disaster film which successfully shocks with its unnerving set ups and exceptional special effects. The cast are on fine form Natasha Yarovenko as Irina,Lorenza Izzo (Kylie) and Nicolás Martínez and Pollock re notable with with Roth himself putting in a good innings as a nameless dad referred to as Gringo. While it is gratuitous it's fitting to the story and tone as with the aforementioned as the leads try to survive the earthquakes aftershocks falling buildings, collapsing tunnels and the social unrest which ensues by escapee prisoners before a tsunami hits Chile. It's well paced with fine cinematography by Antonio Quercia and music Manuel Riviero helps it capture some of the original magic which Roth's first outing did. Even though the ending scene may come as no surprise there are a few twists to peak interest. While not a horror in the traditional sense with graphic amputations, rape, drugs, a human torch, shooting and murders to name a few, granted it will make the regular viewer wince but it's well written and sharply directed by López - forget the endless copycat films of the same sub-genre if you rated Hostel and part 2 this sleeper isn't one to miss."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Set in Chile after a nightmarish earthquake. A group of terrorists find themselves in a dire situation when the prisoners break out of jail and begin to take advantage of the situation. Most films set around disasters tend to focus on the positive outcomes of humanity. The way we come together even though strangers and assist each other in our greatest time of need. But after hearing the news reports of what happened in New Orleans after Katrina it makes a compelling case for a film maker to explore the darkest side of humanity. And as an exploration of that theme Aftershock mildly works moving from one situation to the next. Exploring the negative ways individuals could react. The theme is intriguing and thought provoking from a single mother defending her two children, to a rich man's empathy for his friend and the various ways people actually crack under pressure in the most despicable ways. I only wish the film makers just focused on those things, had a higher budget and delivered a more polished product. But what we have here is mostly a missed opportunity. Despite some decent character development and some nice moments dramatically the film is filled with unintentionally funny performances, seems to have been cut together with the subtly of a chainsaw and is very sloppily made due in some part to the high concept dumbed down by the obvious budgetary constraints. There is also a sub plot involving orphans that leads to an unexpectedly silly and offensive climax. There's a lot of negatives here but I can't say that I hated the movie at all. It's certainly an original film and makes some intriguing points sadly it's bogged down by the amateurness of the production overall and a controlling need to try and make the proceedings entertaining which they never are.So if you've seen taht nifty red band trailer that looks utterly ridiculous and like a lot of fun you're in for a much different experience indeed for better and worse. 3/5"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"A bunch of tourists are in Chile to party, but when an earthquake hits the city, they need to fight for survival, not only against the natural disaster, but also against criminals who seized the opportunity to escape from prison.I would have rated 'Aftershock' higher than 6 of 10 if it wasn't for the boring first 30 minutes. We get introduced to characters who are so dumb that we really wouldn't care if they all get buried by the earthquake. This lengthy introduction turns out to be a waste of time, anyway, because some of them are killed off early, while other characters who are more important for the movie get 3 seconds of back story ('Trust me, I'm a firefighter'). However, after the quake it gets thrilling, violent, suspenseful with a lot of action, which made the movie worth watching after all. I was not surprised to learn in the making of (watched on DVD) that several of the makers of 'Aftershock' have previous experience in comedy rather than horror, it's the timing of some scenes that tells it. For example the lady who shows the tunnel and then makes the mistake to stick her head first - that's the 'oops' timing of a comedy, not a horror movie. But it works and makes the movie more original. Also the background with a catastrophe that destroys the usual human behaviour so quickly is believable. Not too bad after all, but I recommend to press fast forward at the beginning."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I rarely write reviews but wanted to make the effort as I don't think the overall rating does the movie justice. As with all movies, your degree of enjoyment depends on your expectations, favored genres and mood at the time of watching. For me, the title caught my eye as I'm an avid fan of disaster / post-apocalyptic movies. I was a little skeptical seeing the Spanish names of many of the cast, assuming it would be subtitled throughout. I gave it a shot, and found there was good mix of English-spoken lines and subtitles for Spanish to English translation, which actually enhanced the film and made it more 'real-world' for me. A reasonable amount of time was allowed for main character-building, so I was able to form an opinion of each, understand their relationship with each other, and decide whether I liked them and could empathize with them. As with any good character plot-line, your judgment is over-ruled when the **** hits the proverbial fan and the ones you initially disliked become your heroes / heroines. Cutting to the plot-line itself, I found it refreshing that unlike many other lower-budget and less-known disaster movies, the viewer is given time to settle into the scene and characters before all hell breaks loose. That said, often the storyline gets silly after the special effects set in (usually because money is running out) but I didn't find this true with 'Aftershock'. Although the story is fast-moving (and some may say, far-fetched), it's entirely believable from first-hand accounts of real-life survivors of similar tragedies, where law and order can break down so fast that it becomes more of a threat than the disaster itself. In summary, after the main event, the action is non-stop and relentless, and there is sufficient blood-lust for those viewers who enjoy it. The ending was predictable (but most movie endings are these days!) but should be taken in the black-humored, tongue-in-cheek way it was intended. Worth a watch."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Writing and plot suck. We've seen it all before.There is only one reason to watch this--everyone get's their just desserts! This is the only time I've seen all the rotten brat too rich kids get what they deserve and it is fine! Leaves you with that 'great to be alive' feeling. Couldn't happen to nicer people. Why anyone with any sense would go to one of these screwed up So American countries where people have been so psychologically ruined by the church and government for centuries, I do not know!? This is a great ad for 'see America first'. Actually you can find some of these types in the Mid-West and South and all along the Appalachian Trail, so maybe it's better to just stay at home and imagine a trip. Anyway, if you've been cut off by a kid driving a BMW for the umpth time or dissed by a group of youngsters because you're over 30, you need to watch this! It'll make you laugh."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"** MAJOR SPOILERS**Because apparently, I missed the memo.Don't know the man, I'm sure he's a gem of a fellow, but his movies aren't worth watching.I just don't get it. More stupid people in ridiculous situations, more women treated like pieces of meat on the male hormone market and more stupid decisions that lead to dumber consequences.The only thing decent about this film was the fact that Eli Roth allows himself to be killed off.That's not normally something you see...lead actors biting the dirt.As for the rest of the cast...good riddance. I have Don't bother. Could have, should have, been good, as it had a lot of potential, but came apart as quickly as the shattered buildings.What a waste of time..."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Just finished watching it and i have to say, Aftershock is probably the worst movie i've ever seen. I've read other peoples reviews and it got me thinking; did they watch the same move as i did?! First of all the acting is painfully bad. So bad it almost made me want to throw something at the screen. The characters are really annoying (i was actually rooting for mother nature or the prisoners to catch and kill them all.*spoiler alert*they did,hurray) I don't even know what else to say cause the 'acting' was so awful it made me forget everything else about the movie. Only good thing was the beautiful music at the ending credits and the final 5 seconds when the tsunami chased down Miss Party killer. That's all."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Eli Roth certainly has a knack for writing horrible characters and dreadful dialogue. In Aftershock's opening act, he introduces us to a bunch of vacuous party-goers so thoroughly unlikable that I was praying for the film's earthquake to kill them all as soon as possible. Thirty minutes of plot-free shenanigans pass before the quake finally hits, and it's not a moment too soon; unfortunately, the gang somehow survive the collapsing nightclub they are in when disaster strikes, leaving them to flee for their lives, but the streets are no safer, for vicious rapists and murderers from a local prison are on the prowl (at this point, I was cheering on the prisoners to do their worst).What follows is suitably violent, but everything is so poorly written and badly acted that even some juicy gore cannot prevent the film from being a thoroughly annoying experience right up to the totally predictable twist ending (surely the only person who didn't see it coming was the last surviving character).3/10. Please Mr. Roth, find another outlet for your creativity and leave cinema alone. Have you tried basket weaving?"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This film had a 10mil budget? Then why are they just shaking the camera back and fourth to create the shake? - OK maybe that's not what they're doing but the quake was really poorly done. The characters are total A-Holes so best just to watch from when they're all put in grave danger, makes the characters more sympathetic...doesn't improve the acting though. Surprisingly it got better as it went on, with more gore, characters dying off in tragic ways, then the end - I'm fine with that - hahahhaha I'm free - wahhh oh my sister and friends are dead - Here's a tsunami to cheer you up so you can join them...excuse me while I try to run away from the tsunami with a messed up ankle. *Screen fades to black* AFTERSHOCK!!!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This movie doesn't start for me with a bad idea! I like gender bending, and, i am a fan of Genre cult films, so the idea of an horror and a catastrophic film in one, could have been fun and, despite the real bad reviews i went to see it! Oh man was I sorry! This is a low level stinker, with a script and actors who have no chances, beyond resuscitation! Eli Roth who needs to direct maybe, since as an actor he is tragically as interesting as a root canal, truly doesn't come off well of this and has disappointed so many times now, i don't truly know who would wanna watch something he's linked to, next time! And you think he actually even used to be a cool dude at the times of Cabin Fever, and, of the first Hostel! Lately he looks slightly perverse and arrogant, at least, in the movies! Why did he even want to produce this dreary idea made without any true talent or inspiration, and even got himself cast as one of the main roles? Who knows? Maybe, it will remain a mystery, so that he'll get to avoid the embarrassment! Everything here is just so trite and so plain, so cliché and laughable, downright vulgar and derivative, at the best, i finally came to the conclusion that maybe I should truly stick to some of those low budget's B or even C grade Horror flicks, that, at least, most times, are way more interesting to watch than anything like this mess, since those indie Horror's dare more, they push the limits, and, they truly get controversial! Not to mention that, if you are lucky, you may even get more of a true movie carried by some decent camera work, and, way more driven techniques and ambitions, such as, some new visual style of sort that rocks, while driving you places you have never been before, or again, that could somewhat create some real darkness, or at least, for example, could keep you at the edge of your seat or make you feel truly worried! But, this semi costly crap, all telephoned as it is, and, on top, even so fake as it feels, to the limits of ridiculous, ends to become only another annoying failure to entertain, at its very best, and, it never even gets real scary or chilling, nor sexy, and, truly, never visionary, or, at least something a little interesting to watch at any possible level.. without finding yourself thinking about the rest of the week or family trouble! Flicks like this one never surprise you, like instead a good mystery horror should! I am so down on this type of filmmaking, because it disrespects the audience (people who work to pay for this?? NO!!) and the Genre! And, please, don't cast Mr. Roth no more! He's just not that attractive nor amiable or fun to watch, never mysterious or dangerous, menacing looking, he's never believable either, you can tell he's just acting! He just comes off arrogant and weird! Which i am sure he's not in person, but, maybe, because of his lack of acting ability, that is what he clearly projects! If, instead he was to go back to watch those classic Euro Horrors from the Golden era, he says inspired him so much, then, who knows, perhaps, and, with a little effort, he could go back on shooting some new film, and, finally make something daring, provocative and thoroughly scary, and, with some tension, like his first Cabin Fever was... That's all there is sadly to say on this one! Save your money, truly!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I have liked Eli Roth's films, since I watched Cabin Fever, and then of course Hostel 1 and 2 (don't include 3, not directed by him). So, I was looking forward to watching this film.And of course, I wasn't dissapointed. It also star's Eli as well, just like Hostel did (he was in the Amsterdam coffee shop). But in this film, he takes more of a central role.Starts off a bit slow, as in you wonder when the horror will start, as its all nightclubs and drinking, but then all of a sudden, it kicks in....and in, and keeps kicking till the end.As usual with many horror or action films, you tend to know who the 'winner' is, but in this one, its a bit unerving, as the one you expect turns to become one you didn't, and so on....But its a great movie.If you love horror, watch this."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The movie starts with the setup we've all seen a billion times before: Some guys. Are annoying. Horny. Some girls. Are annoying. Horny. Have party. Drink. Try to sex. Good times. Then suddenly... an earthquake!The tone shifts drastically and the world around them goes to hell in a hand-basket real quick. Decimated architecture, riots in the streets, prisoners escaping, warnings of an incoming tsunami, every man for himself, and no one is safe. Anyone can meet their untimely end when you least expect it, just like a real life disaster.This may sound like an intense and nihilistic experience, but beneath the surface, the film sticks to the usual horror movie rules and holds back too much to be a truly effective shocker. In other words, it feels too ""Hollywoodized"". There's also a dumb twist towards the end. Even still, there's just enough carnage here to satisfy undemanding lovers of cinematic slime. A natural disaster movie that puts most of it's focus on animalistic human behavior rather than the flashy special effects could, and should, have been a lot better."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I've had my eye on this for quite a while and was looking forward to what I had hoped to be a fresh & stylish film from Chilean writer/director Nicolás López's first US aimed film debut. Aftershock, being the latest Eli Roth production, comes with certain expectations, some of which were met, others not so much. The film immediately opens with scenes of three men, Gringo(Roth)the practical guy, Pollo(Nicolás Martínez)the laid back ladies man and Pollo's lifelong friend Ariel(Ariel Levy)the nervous type who is preoccupied with reconnecting with his ex-girlfriend, all vacationing in beautiful Chile, having a blast club hopping while looking for some beautiful women to spend the night with. Almost right away they meet three lovely ladies, Monica, Kylie & Irena and agree to travel with them to the town Valparaiso to check out the clubs there. Just when they get comfortable a massive 8.8 earthquake rocks the city and in an instant their paradise is turned upside down and they are left fighting for their lives. Quickly they find not only is the city crumbling around them, but a local prison has collapsed sending gangs of murderous thugs into the city raping, killing & pillaging everything they can find. To make matters worse a tsunami warning siren continuously blasts, making their bad situation into a real life nightmare. All in all, it was a solid, watchable film. Things happen very fast with people all around them continuously meeting violent, grisly deaths. It is a bit hard to relate to exactly what is happening in the film, my biggest gripe would be how it lacks realism, not just in one area but really in mostly all areas. Even with more than thirty plus minutes of character development, I found it hard to truly care about the cast. The film felt surreal at times, times when just the opposite was needed for the film to really click with its audience. It's not a great disaster film or a great thriller/horror film, but in combining the two it does make for a decent overall film and a good way to kill ninety minutes."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"There are many reasons why films fail. Bad taste in regards to the story, taking a real-life tragedy and making a tasteless story out of it, and having characters that the audience just finds repulsive. Add really bad direction, and you've got this movie, one of the biggest flops of the 2010's. The basic story surrounds the group of Partiers out on that fateful night (February 27th, 2010) will become trapped inside of a nightclub when the earthquake hits, and that doesn't happen until later in the film. The first part of the film really doesn't make you care if they survive, and that's not a good thing for a film of this nature.The real horror begins in the last half (as opposed to the psychological horror film in general from the very start), dealing with a group of escaped convicts who torments the survivors in the club. It's a completely unwatchable movie, making me wonder what goes on in the minds of modern filmmakers likeNicolás López who seem to have a total abhorance for humanity and want to make them suffer through vile storylines about vile people. This is one of those films that definitely belongs on the scrapheap because there is not one positive aspect about it."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"First thing is I love disaster movies even ones which have been slated I have enjoyed but this just doesn't work on any level, first thing is nothing happens for over 30mins I suppose they were trying to get you attached to the characters or use shock when things kick off which works incredibly well with an epic film like the perfect storm you really do end up completely engrossed, but with this its an epic failure I just ended up thinking what I'm supposed to feel for these drunks, these over privileged rich kids that act like selfish aggressive *****, I actually was hoping they were going to get taken out lol, mix this with terrible acting clichéd ideas, its all terrible, it earns 2 stars because underneath it there is a couple of nice ideas, but it just goes to prove you do need proper writing/direction and people who can act not just play drunk well, also what we are meant to feel sorry for the main dude because he has a kid..... Omg might work or cut it in a high school drama production, altogether an epic failure, avoid!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"A group of friends in Chili hit up the night clubs for some fun. A massive earthquake hits and destroys half the city, releasing the prisoners that end of unleashing more destruction and hell in the streets. An interesting concept that tries to blend the disaster genre with the horror genre. The result is a mixed bag of depravity, low budget effects & set-ups and hatred for the so called characters we are suppose to engage with. Aftershock doesn't care about much, it wants to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you. This film reminds me a lot of Kevin Smith's ""Red State"" in that it subverts genres and goes in different directions just when you think you know what is going to happen next. While I admire Smith's pulling of the rug from under our feet, Aftershock never manages to reach the same level. Instead it is stuck in this redundant pool of lukewarm unnecessary-ness. Eli Roth produces and stars in the film, I've always said he should stay behind the camera because his on screen talent is severely lacking. Yet he always finds himself in front of the camera, making himself seem more important than he should be. Roth has some good films under his belt, he without a doubt knows the genre of horror. He needs to stick to producing and directing. Get more unique horror films out there, stop worrying about the Roth who acts, cause no one cares. What the film lacks in special effects in makes up for in absurdity. Here is a film that is about destruction, yet it chooses (mainly because they have to) showcase the aftermath. The scenes of chaos happen in tight close ups, shaky cam and whatever else they can think of to disorient the viewer from seeing anything. It seems they saved the budget in the special effects department for the final shot, which one can see coming once the character gets to that location, yawn.Aftershock loves to put characters in bad situations, then kick them when they are down. It might be hard to watch for some people. The film has no problem having one character be raped twice, then shot. This is after another one has been burned alive. This is the so called twist in the film, when we stop focusing on the destruction from mother earth and are focused on human nature. These characters aren't even the prisoners though, these are random street thugs or what have you, that see the women in the streets and decide to chase after them, thus ensuring a lot of death and sorrow for the characters the film has taken so long to set up. No, we don't get any prisoner action until the final act of the film, which takes another turn with another twist. One that will have you scratching your head in confusion, but Aftershock is too crazy and absurd, that you end up just going with it. This isn't much of a disaster flick, nor does it seem to be good horror. It's a low budget miss- match of bad taste."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Yes... and yes!!! You need to believe all the positive reviews! I have a huge grin taking up my whole face right now! That was fo-real! Whoa! powerful, powerful stuff. I was so skeptical to see what I thought was going to be a crap movie. Luckily I decided to believe the few that stood by this movie.You have to see it. omg. Yes the effects could have been a tad and I mean a tiny bit better, but ho-boy that does not take away from the movie. though, this is a one time time watch. Do not skip it!I was gripped. Yes it was a little slow but then it got amazing. I for one agree with the smooth build up. It was very fluffy vacation get-away with good friends, good times, then bam! After all, these crazy disasters usually strike without warning. I understand Eli Roth had something to do with the film and people say he was responsible for most of the gore, but wait a minute, the gore and tragedy are nowhere near this fluffy and nice in real life. I liked that Eli (if he was responsible for adding the realism) had sense to show us the real deal. I really love how this movie shows us how fragile our civility is and how quickly it goes out the window and 'man' reverts back to its gorilla-cave-man true selves. I used to be a gov conspiracist and all that - down with corruption. But I'm damn opened arm to silly lies and deceptions when there's a choice between that and situations like in this movie. Once order is lost for just a few minutes, all hell breaks loose and this movie showed that flawlessly. Rape and murder is the first thing on the menu. People are selfish and only wish to help themselves or to harm others.. without continuing the rant, I'll just say that it really puts a lot of things in perspective. As for the movie - stop reading this and go watch it, trust me! and don't skip ahead like some people suggest, the movie builds up and connects you to all the characters in just enough time that right when you say: okay enough partying, things are going well, I get it - bam! The movie kicks off. and the ending was perfect! beginning to end I had a hell of a ride and I'm so happy I saw this movie.All I have to say is, when hell breaks loose, arm-up. A metal pipe or firearm will be more valuable than a med-kit. And thats a very sad fact that I hate to state."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"A really slow start - skip to about 0:20 or 0:25 or so, a few minutes before the earthquake starts. After that it's just one d*amned thing after another when the earthquake cracks open the prison and the inmates run wild. Rather grisly and unpleasant scenes, but not unrealistic, which just made them worse."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"A handful of travelers partying hearty in Chile manage to survive a sudden earthquake, but find staying alive extremely difficult thanks to a band of vicious looters and a group of equally dangerous inmates who have escaped from a nearby penitentiary. Director Nicholas Lopez, who also co-wrote the dark and twisted script with Eli Roth and Guillermo Amoedo, relates the entertaining story at a brisk pace, adeptly shifts the tone from amiably silly comedy to a more uncompromisingly bleak and harsh sensibility at the thirty minute mark, draws the engaging main characters with admirable depth, delivers a handy helping of outrageously gruesome gore, offers a strong mood of mounting dread, panic, and chaos, presents a few welcome moments of real touching humanity amid all the grim mayhem, and tops everything off with a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor. Moreover, the thumping soundtrack and the lively evocation of the raucous nightclub scene provides an ultra-kinetic buzz while both Lopez's take-no-prisoners nihilistic attitude and the uncompromisingly gritty depiction of how a crisis situation brings out both the best and worst in people gives this picture an extra fierce bite. The zesty acting by the enthusiastic cast rates as another major asset: Roth registers well as affable bumbling tourist Gringo, Nicholas Martinez likewise makes a favorable impression as jolly fat horndog Pollo, plus there are sound contributions from Ariel Levy as hapless goofball Ariel, Natasha Yarovenko as sultry Russian model Irina, Lorenza Izzo as flighty and selfish party girl Kylie, Andrea Osvart as Kylie's uptight buzz crusher sister Monica, and Ramon Llao as savage gang leader Ramon. Both Antonio Quercia's glossy cinematography and Manuel Riveiro's dynamic score are up to speed. Good nasty fun."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"An Eli Roth-penned disaster flick set in the midst of a late night at the club in urban Chile. Close your eyes and try to envision a film based on that description alone and chances are good you'll nail it in one shot. This is thoroughly flippant, sloppy, random and depraved, not even remotely unlike Roth's preceding flicks Hostel and Cabin Fever, so if that's your thing get after it. Personally, I appreciated some of the more creative kills - the last half-hour basically trots them out one after another - and the liberal bloodletting amongst the primary cast members, but it has little else to offer beyond crimson-drenched scenery and some weak SFX shots. Minor points for jerking the wheel a'la Dusk Till Dawn with the mid-sentence earthquake, though."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Mother Nature lays the Smackdown on Chili. Something I like about Roth is that karma has no hold over his characters. It doesn't matter if you are a rich snob, a successful young mother, a rapist, or just a regular Joe; Roth and Nature are unfairly cruel. Act one is like a National Lampoon without nudity, basically a bunch of American tourists partying their asses off hoping to get laid. It's moderately entertaining but after 30 minutes you'll be double checking the description to make sure you didn't accidentally watch a romantic comedy and then the room shakes and zombie unicorns spew from the depths of hell and begin eating people. (okay, that didn't really happen) The last hour is a mad dash to safety. As tsunami sirens wail the only hope is a hospital on the hill and the only way up is a rickety old cable car that can only hold 6 people. (How did they build a hospital with only cable car access?) By this point you won't need reminding this is an Eli Roth horror movie, for better or worse, and you know it's going to be brutal. Is it good? It's okay. I was entertained but the first 30 minutes didn't add enough character development for me to care who lives and dies so it could have been tightened up a bit. A number of things were predictable but that isn't always a bad thing because it can add tension. Aftershock is brutal, it's mean spirited, it's unfair and no character is off limits. I was entertained."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"It's not like this is the first time I've been disappointed, and it's certainly not the case that Aftershock is the only abysmal, truly deplorable amateurish wannabe-feature film that I've had the displeasure to feast my eager eyes on. Though somehow this felt different perhaps it was the anticipation, the fact that I (foolishly) avoided reviews and put my faith in Eli Roth, the sick yet somehow unmistakable visionary behind the glorious Cabin Fever (2002) and Hostel (2005) and refused to foresee anything other than a blood-drenched, high octane original thrill ride that would stand as one of the guilty pleasures of the year.Ladies and Gentlemen, I can inform you with much certainty that there are no pleasures at all to be gained here, and that Nicolas Lopez' grand, thorough failure is one of the worst movies ever made.Is it the acting? the directing? pacing? casting? writing? Yes; all of these. I'd wager that even the catering was an unprecedented failure. Without meaning to sound condescending (I truly take no pleasure in kicking a lame dog) here is a film without a single redeemable feature that wallows in its own incompetence from the extended, unbearable intro to the somehow-even-worse final act and exists as an important example for budding filmmakers of what not to do when aiming to make a film consisting of even just an inch of likability. The intense marketing that Roth himself did for Lopez and this abomination is enough to make me lose all respect for him, and casts considerable doubt over what I hoped to be his masterpiece in The Green Inferno, as well as his credentials as a figure in the genre I hold dearly. I understand that as a producer he needs to promote his project, but to recommend Aftershock is to recommend creating a latch in your head and pouring your brain cells down the sink.As a film fan, I just want to feel a connection to the material displayed before me, whether it be through fear, grief, joy or humor; movies have a magical ability to transport us places and show/teach us things that stick close to our hearts and heads, as well as entertain us like no other art-form in the process. This sorry attempt at entertainment cannot be counted even alongside the dregs of Uwe Boll or Ed Wood, and deserves to disappear deep down the cracks of the quake it conjures to create its awful story.If this review has spawned curiosity, please consider the 4.8 IMDb score and squash it immediately. I went into Aftershock with every intention to love it and after the first 5 minutes cursed my optimism and collector's spirit. There is nothing to see here, please move on.I think I've said enough.Half a dancing Eli Roth out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Quite the worst waste of 90 minutes I've experienced since Hostel 2. Just bad, unoriginal, characters you have little reason to care about, in search of shocks the film continually seeks for escalations but most of them, right down to the ending are predictable. The acting and dialogue weren't altogether bad but I'm really not sure whether in the end this was a bad comedy or a truly awful disaster movie.You have to hope that in the end Eli Roth is not funded to make any more rubbish films - ironic to think some really good film makers get funding cut off at the knees for being un-commercial but this sort of junk gets made. Cabin Fever was OK, just to clarify this review is nothing personal......"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,This movie should be a lot higher than 4.5...It starts off like a typical comedy fun movie then takes a drastic turn with the disaster...Then the movie turns into a gripping thriller type movie that had a lot of things happen i would never expect...It kept me glued to the screen. There is so much crap out there these days that this is certainly a nice change to see...Most of the reviews here certainly don't baseanything on the entertainment factor which this movie certainly packs a punch in. I believe it should be at least rated 6 for that alone.Maybe because it is fairly new it has had a chnace to rate higher...But I honestly do not understand all off the negative comments. Please give it a watch an let me know.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This movie is unique. Most people seem to rate it low and rant about how they don't like it, but really can't give specific reasons. The first problem is the setup taking 45 minutes. Everyone came in expecting an earthquake, and we got a tour of Chile for 45 minutes. The frustration of waiting for the earthquake put a bad taste in mouths of the viewers. Then, they kill the 3 guys. These 3 were the main characters of the film for over an hour, and then they all die, but the movie doesn't end. So, we are lead to believe that there has to be more - maybe a twist ending involving the 2 remaining girls. But, nope. Everyone dies. The end. Duh.So, I get why people are down on this film. But, try to remember that the tsunami warning hit about 10 minutes after the earthquake, so the characters and viewers had time to prepare. And, we got the earthquake we wanted, plus a free tour of Chile.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting - 1/1;Casting - 1/1;Directing - 1/1;Story - 0.5/1;Writing/Screenplay - 0.5/1Total Base Score = 4Modifiers (+ or -):Technical Effects/Make Up: 0.5Total RealReview Rating: 4.5 (rounded up to 5 for IMDB)"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Three friends (one of which is portrayed by Eli Roth) party in Chile. We spend the first half of the film meeting these guys, and learning about each of them. They meet a trio of women, and party with them throughout Chile too. While in an underground dance club in the city, an earthquake hits. Following that initial earthquake, we follow the survivors as they face many obstacles, including aftershocks from the initial blast, missing limbs, looters in the streets, loud storm sirens indicating an incoming tsunami, and freed prisoners who escaped when the initial earthquake opened up the prison. The build-up to the disaster takes forever though, and we spend half of the film meeting the characters before the earthquake. There isn't much to note in terms of acting, as no one stands out, but no one is annoying enough to warrant loads of complaints. There are small roles by Selena Gomez and RZA as well. Not the worst horror movie I've rented recently, but with Eli Roth involved, one would expect better."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"It's a hook-up? It's a rave? It's a disaster film? It's a horror film? It doesn't know! This film is all over the place. The actual the disaster comes way too late, with the first half hour all about these guys trying to hook up with these girls. Then the first quake hits and the mania begins, people taken out by falling objects (reasonable), shot (less reasonable), hunted by escaped prisoners (during an earthquake/tsunami?!) taken out by a prisoner posed as a firefighter (they got me there).The whole thing is just nonsense... and a cameo by Selena Gomez?! What was she thinking."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Some of the reviews here were expecting a horror movie, yet this is an updated version of the old disaster movies of the '70's, i.e. ""Earthquake"", ""Towering Inferno"", and ""Poseidon Adventure"". Personally, I thought the movie was well done. The ""Prisoners"" were stereotypically rapists and such...I don't know what prisoners are like in Chile...Regardless, I'd recommend this movie if you like a disaster movie. Pretty good special effects, bad acting at times...but, what movie doesn't have all that, anyway?Give it a shot...there's some gore, there's some cursing, there's a lot of violence. Not a total waste of time...excellent for a Saturday afternoon..."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"An Eli Roth movie, essentially, he doesnt direct, but stars and writes and produces, so... Its a disaster flick thrown together with kind people who in face of tragedy, band together to help each other survive. LOL. I said it was an Eli Roth movie remember... A group of over-privileged douche bags go out for a night on the town in Chile. And while they're being douche bags in some awesome nightclub, the Earth decides to get into and put on a dance herself, thus killing a shit ton of people almost instantly...one of the douche's loses a hand trying to save some hot chick, thats what you get for being nice asshole. Once they get outside the world is in chaos and the douche bags find out that while all this is going on we also find out that a bus load of dangerous prisoners over turned and many escaped, so we have that to look forward too. So for the type of movie it is, and from who made it... and of course if you know who Eli Roth is and what he does, then you'll know exactly what youre getting yourself into. And I'm sick in the head, so, I really liked it. Peace."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"""Without you we are going to die. I don't know where I am, we don't speak Spanish."" Three friends travel to South America for a fun and relaxing vacation. One night while out at a club they met a group of women and begin to pair off. What starts out as a fun and promising night takes a terrifying turn when they are involved in an earthquake. Things then start to get worse and worse for the group. This surprisingly is a movie that I didn't really expect anything from. When the biggest name in the movie is Eli Roth, as an actor not a director, there really isn't much hope for goodness. While I can't say the movie is good it was entertaining and found myself having a good time watching it. The best way to describe this is that the whole movie has the feel of the beginning of Hostel or Turistas. Showing the friends having fun in a foreign country and not realizing the horror that is coming. Unlike those movies though there is no cutting people up, but if you like those two movies then this one is for you. Nothing else to say really, pretty generic but it is entertaining at least. Overall, this was better then expected but still very generic. I give it a B-."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I won't recap the plot, because other reviewers have done it much better than I could. But I do want to express that I feel this was an absolutely brilliant movie by a wonderful and talented newcomer, Nicolas Lopez, with the collaboration of established master Eli Roth.We'd all like to think (or hope) that everybody will be philanthropic and kind in the face of disaster, but this film shows us the frightening reality of human nature. When you're injured and in pain and terrified you maybe won't meet kind helping hands - you could just as likely meet looters, sadists and rape squads. I've been a traveller my whole life, and I know from personal experience how close the border is between middle-of-the-night drunken fun and horrifying death when you're far from home.I'm very conservative with my grading at IMDb, but I think this film deserves a rare 10 out of 10."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,This movie was ok. I liked it. It could've been so much better though. There was or is a lot of potential if this movie were remade. They would've been way better off if they had an action star with martial arts skills like Steven Seagal or a star like him but in the movie they would've been ex special forces from the MARINEs or the NAVY to play the hero that keep the escaped prisoners at bay or kills them off one by one or so so that none of the stuff the prisoners did to the women did not have to happen. I am a U.S. MARINE and obviously I am not in the movie making business but I could've made this movie way better and more successful than it was or is.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"AFTERSHOCK is the latest in a long line of films (including HOSTEL and HUMAN CENTIPEDE) that has come to prove one thing: Americans should never travel abroad... ever!!! Imagine if you combined a disaster film like TOWERING INFERNO with SAW and you've got the idea. The plot: Somewhere in Chile, three losers from America travel down there for vacation and to hook up with hot ladies. Right off the bat, the trio's not much to write home about because they act like drunken idiots, overlooking the thousands of already-gorgeous ladies at each and every nightclub they visit. After reinforcing the ""ugly Americans"" image over and over again, they find themselves inside an exclusive underground club when a massive earthquake hits. Pandemonium ensues as rubble collapses, pinning one of the main character's arms. But they manage to sever it off and escape with three women (though not one person thinks to make a tourniquet for their injured friend, dummies). Also, a nearby prison was hit by the same quake. So now, escaped prisoners are running rampant in the streets. Not running off to start a new life elsewhere, mind you, but by looting, shooting and chasing after the group, with the singular goal of raping the women. By this point, I had to scoff at how ridiculous this whole film was becoming. All of the characters were so stupid and inept, it's a wonder they didn't all die within the first thirty minutes. Even when one character manages to hide, his cover is blown when his cell phone suddenly blurts out. Oh well, he wasn't contributing much to the film anyway! Just once, couldn't we have a disaster flick where a group of smart people try and make it out alive? Where characters aren't concealing ulterior motives and blah-blah-blah?! Take my advice, avoid this disaster and watch any or all of the following: TOWERING INFERNO, AIRPORT, POSEIDON ADVENTURE (the 70s version) and, most recently from Korea, THE TOWER."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"That was certainly the biggest reveal of this relatively competently shot but ultimately cheese pseudo horror. First off great location, lovely shots and scenery. The main cast were relatively solid and likable enough characters and the first part of the movie was fun with hot chicks to look at including the scenery, I really enjoyed some of the characters and their interaction. The problem was that when things took a turn for the worse the tone of the film was such that sympathy for the characters really didn't strike a chord at all. Add to this plot twists from a bad Samllville episode and an extreme prejudice towards people with tattoos and the second half of the film, oh the irony near the end, just played out plain dumb. The 'horror' induced by the plot device was so one dimensionally depicted it was almost comical, also one character seems to undergo such a complete change of nature in a about 10 seconds that really sums up the ridiculous and essentially low brow and lazy story."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"There is obviously a joke to be made about fecal matter and the title of this picture (which has probably happened a million times) but after watching Aftershock...a total disaster ""of a"" movie, I don't feel like ""piling"" on. Which might sound mean but I surprisingly did find this movie entertaining in delightful ways I hadn't expected despite how negative this review might come across.Where to start? My god is Aftershock a terrible/good movie. I wanted to like this movie so bad but I must have burst out laughing a dozen times at parts of the movie that weren't clearly meant to be laughed at. If it was, Eli and company are actually geniuses.The enjoyment was mostly due to the fact that they had zero dollars for CGI and decided to use CGI for virtually everything. Some major events you couldn't even tell what was going on cause the CGI was so poorly done to the point of being unrecognizable. Not so much the blood and guts kind of way (which was lacking) but important stuff, like major events that come out looking like something you'd see on SyFy.But even better (if you are looking for this sort of thing) the combined horrible writing/acting on display, actually kept my interest from start to finish, in a so bad it's good kinda way. With a busy schedule and a short attention span, I have a hard time sitting down for a movie in one viewing but no lie (maybe I was in a really good mood at the time) I watched Aftershock the entire way through on the first try, with only a slight ache in my belly from laughing so hard.For those interested in what Aftershock was shot with (a C-300) and more importantly what the final outcome looked like, I'm pleased to say the outside daytime shots looked great and the low-light shots were more than passable. Ignoring the fact that there is a lens being used that is probably more expensive than the camera it is attached to, this should inspire a lot of future filmmakers to go out there and make their own movies without the constraint of needing expensive cameras looming over them.PROS -One or two good twists relating to how one might act during a crisis -Killer untouched locations straight from the actual quake -Shot on a camera cheaper than most cars but doesn't look like it -Eli Roth's over acting is fun to laugh at.CONS -Virtually no gore in a movie promising gore! A rubber appendage from the dollar store bouncing around the screen for 5 minutes does not a Fulci film it make.FINAL SCORE I was all set to give it 1/10 for being a technically well shot movie but still horrible, then a 2/10 for making me laugh when I wasn't expecting to but as the final scene approached, I told myself, if the film makers went in the direction where I hoped they were going to go, I'd bump it up another point. And boy did they ever go there. Good job people.3/10 stars"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Started watching this with extremely low expectations, as far as I'm concerned the mere association of Eli Roth's name to a project is a guarantee for awkward pacing, misfired attempts at cheeky humour, inability (or maybe unwillingness) to build up anything close to tension. And even this time around Mr Roth - although not entirely at the helm - manages to tick all the boxes, and yet... somehow this little unassuming little romp, a not so original variation on the canon of the innocent abroad catapulted into hell (for once not of his own making) it's only on the surface what it seems to set out to be. As it progresses, making the point of how death is really the great equaliser, it really manages to weave a nihilistic tapestry of human despair, proving the point of how no good deed goes unpunished and how cosmically irrelevant we really are. Eli's character does not eat shell fish, so I guess that makes him a good Jew, and yet, he still manages to meet a horrible death. The point being, there is no god, or if there is, he/she's really got a messed up sense of humour. And to the ones objecting to the fireman's about face during the climax, well, actually it makes sense. It takes all sorts of rejects to fill up a prison, and the guy was clearly a sociopath. I kinda liked it."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Not entirely sure why people are reviewing this film so very poorly. If you've ever seen an Eli Roth movie, you know what to expect, which essentially is that it's kind of cheap, lots of blood, lots of gore and a few awkward laughs thrown in here and there on a modest film budget. I found this to be no different. I loved Cabin Fever and I knew what to expect after Hostel so should others not know this, too? Should they even be reviewing this film if they had no idea what they were going to be watching? I don't think so. I don't go into Resident Evil expecting it to be Hotel Rwanda and, if I did, I wouldn't then review Resident Evil on IMDb because it wasn't the Hotel Rwanda I was expecting. Just a thing to think about when you read these reviews, folks.In any case, the film was pretty much what I expected. It's a little cheesy, a little quirky, ample blood and gore (although maybe not enough for the torture porn crowd), some uncomfortable rape scenes and plenty of Eli Roth atmosphere. Generally, I found it was a decent flick. It's a little dark but has moments that will make you laugh, too. It's not going to set the world on fire or win any grand awards, but if you know what to expect from Roth and/or are a fan of this type of film, you'll find it enjoyable enough, as I did."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"How on earth did this movie get made? It is the worst movie I have watched in years. Unrealistic characters and awful acting. Rubbish script but at least some of the scenes of Valparaiso were great. Chile is an amazing place. I'd love to see more movies made in this region. Just don't invite those clowns backIf this was an attempt at a zombie movie, it failed. If it is a lame attempt at Jewish humour, it failed. This is a very poor effort and you would be ill advised to spend money to watch this tripe. It is an hour or so of your life that you will never get back. A budget of $10 million..... yeah right. Take about three zeros off that. Had to give it something so I gave it a 1 ... generous soul that I am."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I'm 30 minutes into the movie and nothing is happening. I will give it another 10 minutes if nothing happens I'm turning this movie off. So far, it's boring as hell."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I've dually noted in the past that Eli Roth is a director I regard as one I'd like to hear speak at a convention or at a meeting rather than someone whose film I'd watch and review. He seems to have genuine respect for the horror genre, but has a very awkward, difficult way of showing it. His films often feature large amounts of gory violence, identifiable xenophobia, redundant situations, cardboard characters, and facile plots. They're the kind of horror film where you watch, wince, and then walk away undisturbed.Now comes Aftershock, a film where Roth's credentials lie everywhere but in the director's section, which is occupied by Nicolás López. Aftershock, which now is playing in very limited release and on various video on demand outlets, concerns three buds (Eli Roth, Nicolas Martinez, and Ariel Levy) who spend their vacation-days clubbing in Chile when an enormous earthquake hits destroying much of the infrastructures. It also destroys all civil behavior, as the three men, accompanied by three lovely ladies they meet, now must find ways to survive in times of true hell when they wander unprotected through the crowded and seriously ravaged streets of Chile.Aftershock must immediately be given credit solely for its ambition, for it's not everyday we see an unassuming independent picture take on the difficult task of being a disaster film. Disaster films are prominently released in theaters, by a director with a name like Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, boasting millions in financial backing with special effects companies that can embellish the drop of a coin to serve as an event. An independent film, in this case, a film with about $10 million in financial costs, clearly doesn't have the immense resources or backing that a mainstream picture would have. Just the idea that López chose to pursue an idea like Aftershock, when every conceivable odd is against the production warrants some resemblance of respect.It's just a shame, overall, that the picture is still the vague letdown that it is. It plays like Roth's mediocre film Hostel, which was about a group of twenty-somethings that venture out to a foreign country and wind up becoming the victims to a sadist's sick, brutal games. The first thirty minutes are plagued by tedious scenes of partying, equipped with spastic lighting, obnoxiously loud music that could be the direct blame for the earthquake, and an onslaught of flirting and attempts at pick-up. Then, finally, the earthquake occurs and we are then given roughly fifty minutes of surviving the lethal jungle of civilization lost.In retrospect, and as bad as this could've been what with a relatively low budget, Aftershock is quite serviceable and occasionally impressive. As expected, however, we're robbed of real characters (although Roth can be quite amusing at times playing a neurotic, lovesick geek) and any tension in the film's screenplay. Roth has always been a ""get to it"" kinda guy, neglecting tactics of dread and suspense to tell a story. Working with co-writers Nicolàs López and Guillermo Amoedo, this kind of approach makes the film function but not entirely, seeing as this is the kind of story that could've greatly benefited from scenes of true terror and fright.Good horror/disaster movies have unfortunately become novelties, but because of its lower budget, Aftershock possesses a kind sincerity and intimacy in its material that allows itself to be rewarded with recognition. The film moves along at a pace that isn't sluggish nor lightning-fast, the action is rather clear, and it provides an anxious audience member with more or less of what they want in return from a film like this. Its ambition warrants likability but its execution includes disappointment.Starring: Eli Roth, Nicolas Martinez, and Ariel Levy. Directed by: Nicolás López."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Eli Roth's ""Aftershock"" should have been a frightening cinematic experience since I do live in earthquake country. But after forty minutes of needless setup, scene after scene of sequences which mimic those outrageously low budget SyFy Channel movies shown at two in the morning, and the fact that my suspicions of this films watchability were already high considering it was only produced (not directed) by Roth, it soon became clear that ""Aftershock"" was built on a foundation which literally fell apart at the seams.Synopsis: A group of ""young people"" who seek an adventure (lead by non-actor Eli Roth himself) attempt to find it in a country outside of the United States. And then bad stuff happens. Does this plot sound like ""Hostel"" yet? Well, it is sort of ""Hostel"", in Chile, if the sadistic killers had been replaced by a natural disaster.The problem with this film comes down to the simple fact that the duration of an earthquake is only a few seconds long. So, after said phenomenon occurs, the movie doesn't seem to know what to do with itself, as if Roth and friends hadn't come prepared with any other plot development which could sustain a feature length film. So, aside from a few smirk inducing social network jokes, an extremely short back and forth between Roth and one Selena Gomez and some minor suspenseful situations in the final 30 minutes, ""Aftershock"" is a generic and somewhat boring horror endeavor.Final Thought: The ending is actually the best part of this movie, and I'm not even being sarcastic. The final twist used by writer/director Nicolas Lopez is pretty clever. But what one has to wade through to get to this finale is not at all worth the time. Besides, at the end of the day, ""Aftershock"" is a film where the faster you realize the kind of low grade production it is, the faster you may want to turn it off (or walk out).Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Look I am a fan of crazy movies but this one was a bomb a stinkbomb! Where do I start? The weak plot? The movie was slow but picked up by the time you liked the characters they were dead, raped or smooshed. I was disappointed with this whole thing. Eli Roth needs to stop making these bad movies and wasting two hours of peoples lives with this cat food movies."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"It was a good movie. Loved most of the cast. But like many other horror or survival movies, more than necessary time is wasted on building the plot. Though the intro was good and colorful, 30 minutes shouldn't have been wasted before things get worse. My other gripe is that since it was a disaster movie, at least 80% of the deaths should have been because of the nature. But unfortunately only the first and the last death out of the group of 6 people is because of earthquake accident & Tsumani while the rest were just murders. Other than that it was a quiet enjoyable movie."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"AFTERSHOCK has potential, I'll give it that. It's a Chilean disaster movie, and how many of those do you see anyway? The storyline follows a mixed group of American and Chilean friends who decide to go out clubbing on the same night that an earthquake befalls the country, turning everything into chaos. The characters must attempt to evade death at the hands of collapsing buildings and infrastructure while at the same time avoiding the violent criminals who've escaped from the local jail.This film does start off quite promisingly, with a slow first half that sets up some mildly interesting character interaction. Writer Eli Roth bags a big role as a geeky father figure who spends his time trying to score with various women, although Nicholas Martinez's comic Pollo is the film's most likable character. I felt quite tense waiting for bad stuff to happen, but when it does the film slowly falls apart.The low budget nature of the movie becomes apparent in the paucity of the special effects, including some very poor CGI work. The plotting falls apart entirely and this becomes a random chase movie with a dwindling group of survivors evading various stock villains. The emphasis is on gore and violent death, and it's all rather unpleasant but not in the least bit disturbing; it's too silly for that. The ludicrousness of the CGI fire effects lessen the experience, and the latter half of the film in particular has no power, coming across as predictable and hackneyed. That dumb twist ending which has been signposted a mile off only serves to sink things further."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Shot on an ugly 8 bit DSLR, cheapening an already dirt cheap script -- this film fails on a visual and visceral level, which is the only thing going for it. This is a film destroyed by poor direction. The actors are fine, but can not transcend a production that works against them. Gore is the only element of care here, and even that is cheapened by the heinous cinematography. Eli Roth is an unjust punching bag these days, but it's getting hard to defend him when he associates himself with Z grade cinema. Man with the Iron Fists; Aftershock; Last Exorcism 1 and 2. Damn it man, you know what makes a good flick, so back something worth at least half a damn. Unwatchable."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Three Americans Gringo (Eli Roth), Ariel, and Pollo are traveling through Chile drinking wine. They scam their way into a party. Three hot girls sisters Monica and Kylie and Russian friend Irina also scam their way into the party. Gringo is divorced with a daughter and Irina has a son. The two groups spend the next day together and go to an underground party when an earthquake hits.This is Eli Roth and his two douchey friends with 3 hot girls in a troubled South American country. The Zach Galifianakis wannabe is annoying without being funny. Zach is able to make his characters lovable. These are characters without any rooting interest. It adds to the douche factor with a Selena Gomez cameo as an entitled celebrity. It takes forever for the earthquake to happen and start the movie. It's not like Eli Roth is a great writer of dialog. It's over 30 minutes of boring drunk people and superficial arguments. The best thing is that Eli Roth marries his co-star in real life. There are some good kills but I couldn't care less about these characters."

唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Another lame, misogynistic, unwatchable murder porn piece from Eli Roth. I guess this is another movie from his ""Do not travel to XXX"" series or something. I really do not understand why there are some countries yet that allow this guy to shot flicks on their ground as the resulting picture is always overwhelmingly negative.So the guy who hates all the humanity decided to introduce Chile to the world. It is full of murderers, rapists, egoists, corrupt people an it seems to be quite understandable that this hole of sin must be cleared in way of tremors, fire, waves, rape, murder and such funny attractions. Every good deed from the American tourists will be punished and only the most annoying character will remain as it fits the perverted world of sin and sickness pictured by the Great Misogynist.Well, let's stop to call this ""cinematography"" and let's call it slightly informative murder porn instead. This is clearly intended for people who somehow like murder porn yet do not want to download it from the servers in Ukraine where such porn is provided for a fee. They are probably afraid that these sick foreigners will suck their funds from a credit card so this movie seems to be somewhat safer alternative.Those who love catastrophic movie will pick other titles like Bolge (The Wave) from Norway. It is also very dark but realistic and does not assume every non-Western human is a sick bastard in the depths of his heart."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) really has gone downhill. There was a time when he was hailed as a something refreshingly new in the horror genre. However, if 'Aftershock' is anything to go by, he really has lost his muse.It's about a group of people, holidaying in Chile when an earthquake hits. The first problem is that all the characters are pretty unlikeable, spending their time trying to pull, moaning or taking drugs. This might not be too bad if the story quickly moves on to the action, but it takes the best part of the film for the earthquake to hit. By this time you really won't care much if any of them (besides Roth himself, who's 'fish-out-of-waterness' is quite endearing) live or die.Apparently in Chile, the general population consists of looters, rapists and murderers, for as soon as the earthquake hits, the country descends into anarchy. Then our - pretty horrid - heroes find themselves being pursued by people only slightly more unlikeable then themselves.This film has no real redeeming features - a few moments of gore (which I didn't know whether were supposed to be humours or not) and that's about it. Granted there are worse movies, but there are a million better ones. If you do decide to watch it, you might as well start the film at about 45 minutes - at least you'll skip the bits that are even more tedious than the last 45 minutes.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I'm always looking forward to Eli Roth's projects, he almost always has good ideas for these types of movies, and in my opinion the concept of this movie didn't disappoint.It all starts when Gringo visits his friend Ariel and Ariel's friend Pollo in Chile. They meet 3 girls at a party and convince them of going the next day to another city with them, where an acquaintance of Pollo owns a hotel. There, after going sightseeing, they all go to a club and an earthquake hits the city. With some injuries they manage to get out of the club, before it collapses. The earthquake was so strong, that the club wasn't the only collapsed building, including a nearby prison, where some of the inmates also manage to escape and all hell breaks loose. I'll leave it there since I don't want to spoil the ending.Although the story and characters become a bit predictable, with a couple of plot holes here and there (I really didn't understand the fireman characters intentions), it still is an entertaining film to watch and more so if you enjoy Roth's work."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I went into this expecting a lower budget film about a group of party goers including Eli Roth, who get trapped inside a nightclub when a massive earthquake hits Chile. To my surprise this was a much bigger form of disaster film. The scope of the movie shows much of ""The Real"" Chile as the character played by the director Nicolas Lopez tells his American friend simply called ""Gringo"" played by Roth. The situations and the way the characters responded to these life and death choices are brutally realistic. They use practical effects to show the destruction and carnage once the earthquake hits and the blood effects are well done. It takes a bit of run time before the earthquake happens, but not too long and then the action does not stop.In the DVD making of the director said he got the idea for this movie because he survived a tragedy like this that struck Chile in 2010. It shows in the careful attention he took to make it feel real.This review was written by Curt Wiser, Author of the novel ""Box Cutter Killer"" and Writer-Director of the movie ""Cam-Girl"" (aka ""Web-Cam"")."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I reluctantly started watching this movie because it had a very low IMDb rating and I wasn't expecting much. But this movie took me by surprise, first it was a great build up that lasted about 30 minutes and it's good that kind of build up because it increases the curiosity as well, I don't know why people are bashing this build up?. After they build up then came the earthquake that was just a beginning of a nightmare for our characters. The movie is so unpredictable and unprecedented it keeps you guessing what is going to happen to our characters and the characters we first thought would be survivors begin to die gruesome deaths one by one. The movie has plenty of twists & turns and can cater well to different kinds of audience. And in the end the mother nature wreaked it's havoc which I didn't see coming. This movie shows all the horrors that an earthquake can bring about: buildings crumbling, prisoners escaping because of that and so on. So overall well directed, well acted, well written movie, it's a truly underrated one and it's way better than any final destination movie. After this movie I will not trust IMDb ratings ever. The people bashing this movie: I really don't know whether they have seen the same movie or a different one."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Aftershock spends an excruciating 40 minutes before you even see any sort of earthquake. Some might think they're introducing characters but really we watch some very shallow people partying and being shallow and talking about the opposite sex. There is very little actual development though we do get some tidbits about their personal lives. Finally the earthquake strikes and I thought it would be a turning point for the film but as it turns out...it actually got worse. The ridiculous, gratuitous violence, the horrible campy acting and overacting and the pointless story twists make it an unbearable watch. By the time the film ends I regretted watching the film at all but had already put too much time into it to turn away. There were some okay performances in the movie but the script was atrocious and the music added to the completely over dramatization of everything. I mean, an earthquake in a third world country is a very real prospect and when you have talent behind a picture (The Impossible for instance) it can be powerful and very real. This was meant to be some sort of shock horror film and they blew that too because its silly and doesn't know whether its trying to be serious or a straight up torture horror film.The guys are played by Eli Roth, Nicolás Martínez and Ariel Levy. Martínez is probably the best of them and certainly has the biggest character development in the movie. Roth looks and behaves ridiculously and just seems so out of place and almost bored until his climatic scene which is so overplayed, its almost funny. Levy's character and performance is more obnoxious than anything and his climatic earthquake scene is grotesquely laughable. Watching the three guys trying to recover his severed hand is like watching a bad three stooges skit. The girls are played by Natasha Yarovenko, Lorenza Izzo and Andrea Osvárt. The one mildly interesting aspect of their characters is the sister drama between Osvárt and Izzo but we don't even get to explore that at all. They spend the latter half of the film running around over-acting and being forced into disgusting unnecessary sexual scenes. As if the cast wasn't bad enough already they add Marcial Tagle in a horrible, campy role to add some sort of slasher flick element that serves to make this even worse than it already was.I get the idea behind Aftershock and it isn't a terrible idea. They wanted to a gory horror flick where the killer is an earthquake but its done in all the wrong ways. All of these serious moments in the movie are made completely laughable and worthy of an eye roll because of the horribly awful performances by this cast. The overacting is some of the worst I have ever seen. Even the earthquake itself which you wait 40 minutes before is anti-climatic and silly. A powerful earthquake should be the easiest and most impressive part of a film called Aftershock but they don't even do that right. Director Nicolás López seems to come from the Chilean indie circuit which makes this even sadder that he can't capture a film about his home country to any great degree. This ended up being yet another awful indie ""horror"" flick. I also don't believe for a minute that they had to cut the film to squeak it in for an R rating because it was ""so extreme."" Total marketing ploy because I've seen much gorier films and the fact that its so bad and funny means there is no way they cut anything from this. I thought the first 40 minutes were too slow but you know what the first 40 minutes watching the six of them parade around Chili was more entertaining than the crap that followed. I will give it a single kind word and that was the last thirty seconds because it made me laugh out loud and was somehow a fitting ending. Please skip this stupid crap. It was truly awful. 2/10"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"(as the theme from ""Dragnet"" goes!)Thoroughly and aggressively awful, another repellent Eli Roth vehicle that has no reason to exist. He's directed one okay horror movie (""Cabin Fever"") and what is the greatest-trailer-for-a-movie-that-doesn't-exist (""Thanksgiving""). But, that's it. He's becoming the M. Night Shyamalan of horror. Someone bordering on completely untalented who somehow keeps getting writing and directing assignments.The movie goes on for 34 too-long minutes before it gets to the earthquake. And, on the small budget, it's a bunch of shaky-cam combined with stuff falling down. After that, it's about 50 minutes of killings, rapes, assaults, etc. The characters' actions make little sense, and everyone is just there to get killed off one by one. There's even a blatant Zach Galifianakis knock-off character!This is kind of a Disaster Movie combined with a Horror Movie. And, in Horror Movie fashion, there's the requisite ""Final Girl."" The movie wants to have its surprises, but there's nothing remotely surprising about the ""surprises!""Badly written, directed, etc., etc., this movie should be avoided at all costs! Oh, by the way, Eli Roth ""acts"" in this movie, and his character suffers a particularly extended and gruesome fate. So, there's that!* (1 Star Out of 10)"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I put this on, expecting your typical schlocky disaster movie, which I enjoy even though they are usually worthless. Usually, you follow your core group of main characters - who are mostly untouched by the disaster - as you watch hordes of nameless, faceless mobs die, while clumsy CGI special effects blast them, or burn them, or hurl them to kingdom come. Tsk tsk, what a shame - there go another hundred or so unlucky boobs. I think I'll get up and get a snack - might as well leave it running - I won't miss anything. This wonderful movie is nothing like that. This movie has an exceptional cast, whom you follow through the HELL that they are experiencing, in a very realistic portrayal. I cared about these characters. They have personalities that grow on you. They console each other. They try to protect each other - against the absolutely terrifying scenario that they are trying to survive. Some reviewers complained that it was slow going until the earthquake. I guess they must have short attention spans, and if nobody is dying at the moment they loose interest. You hear about earthquakes in other parts of the world (other than where I live, at least, in NYC) and you hear 10,000 died, 100,000 died or 250,000 died, but you just can't imagine what it could be like to see such a thing happening. If you want to be immersed in the sheer terrifying horror of such an event, prepare yourself and then watch Aftershock. An unqualified 9 stars. One of my very favorites of this genre."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The very first thing what came to my mind was ""I bet this kind of stuff would actually happen if Chile was hit by an earthquake."" I mean, when it comes to crime, rape and overall criminal action, South America is a promised land for all the criminal degenerates on this planet. Just check Best Gore, if you don't believe me. South America is a real tihs hole. I didn't actually think this movie would turn in to a depiction of that rather than a sleek disaster movie, but it did. The natural disaster was kinda left alone and that was a foul move. The characters, including yet another brainless party girl portrayed by non other than Roth's later spouse Izzo, are the kind of characters you don't really want to get to know. And I think Izzo should stick to modelling because she isn't a very good actress. The only reason, why I giving this 6 instead of 5, is the ending. it completely surprised me, like a good ending should."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"AFTERSHOCK: At various points in the film, Aftershock made me think of 'Demoni', 'Igor & the Lunatics' and even 'Escape from New York'--but without any of the positives those films may possess: The worst of Italian B-grade meets a humorless Troma. Even less kindly, it makes Charles Band seem like an auteur.Apparently, producer Eli Roth and director Nicolas Lopez want to teach us how horrible Chile and Chileans are. Not enough movies do this. But (and here breathe a sigh of relief for familiarity's sake) it also teaches us that young people are just as vapid and mindlessly slutty nowadays as they were in those halcyon days of 80s B-grade--only now they have smart phones! Oh, and one more lesson: Chilean scrotums look just like American ones. (Belated spoiler alert: you will see a scrotum in this film.)The babes are sexier and skinnier than ever. (One's Russian, even! And you know what that means!) However, the one with short hair (though still a babe) is kind of a c##k-blocker, sort of like a dude, maybe a lesbian, and definitely a downer! I mean, her clothes are nowhere near skimpy enough and at one point she even disparages her sister's casual promiscuity!The guys are all hairy (who knew that was hot?!) and kinda retro; except for the American guy who, though still hairy (psst, it's Eli Roth) is kinda preppy. But that's because, as an American, he's clearly more decent, God-fearing, cleaner, more moral etc. than the Godless Chileans and any other 'forners'. The Chilean locals, for their part, are all, like, 'Igor & the Lunatics' meet 'Mad Max'. (""Someone"" should bomb the place into the stone age, like ""they"" did to Afghanistan!)Aftershock is practically a documentary! It belongs in every time capsule interred from now on. Future generations need to know exactly what young people and Chileans from the n0ughties were REALLY like! I'm sure they'll be relieved to know that their babes are just as slutty as retro babes were!AFTERSHOCK: A fine film! I award it 5 Gilded Scrotums out of a possible 5."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This director along with Eli Roth should go to sleep for a long while and think long and hard before making another film. It is just plain awful. Its so misogynistic, senseless and depressing i couldn't bare it. I find it hard to believe it has nearly 5 rating!The acting was terrible especially from Roth who should just stop making, producing or staring in films. After 30 minutes of pointless party scenes...pointless other than showing lots of scantily dressed model type woman hungry for sex with what seems any man willing, we then get the frankly stupid earthquake scene.of course this was clearly introduced to partly show half naked girls with short skirts climbing up ladders to gain height while the camera (fortunately for the audience) is right underneath her and looking up skirts! Also its just a silly way to separate some degree of normality into the depravity of small minded Chilean people?, all of whom seem to want to torture people they never met and sexually assault all women, undeterred by their pending doom of a tsunami.I mean films like this are so bogged down with the idea that all men are capable of pointless murder and causing suffering to those they hardly know its just stupid. It reminded me of the almost equally bad 'The Divide' in feeling.Anyway, no point me saying anything else. Each to their own but for me really poor. And yes i know slasher movies and other horrors have similar themes of half naked woman/sex/drink/drugs = death, but this exercise of a film didn't serve those purposes either and was flat, dull, without humour, without character, without substance or any sensitivityCrap!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Can't say I'm a huge fan of Eli Roth's work, as a Director & as an Actor but I did quite enjoy this movie. However, I do have to agree with other reviewers here, it does have a very slow beginning. The earthquake doesn't start until exactly 35 minutes into the film. It could have happened much sooner into the movie. There were a lot of irrelevant scenes I felt could have been cut.Once the earthquake hits, the movie gets going & gets much better with some quite outstanding special effects.The survivor of the movie was totally not who thought it was going to be. I actually thought this character would have been one of the first to be killed but how wrong was I?!As for the ending, that was the real aftershock for me! Totally didn't see it coming & is just amazing & beautifully shot. Definitely an 8/10 for this."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"'AFTERSHOCK': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Horror master Eli Roth co-wrote, co-produced and co-stars in this disaster/horror film about six tourists trying to survive the aftermath of an earthquake that hits an underground nightclub in Chile. Chilean director Nicolas Lopez directed the film as well as co-wrote it with Roth and Guillermo Amoedo (another Chilean filmmaker). Lopez and Roth came up with the idea for the film while discussing Lopez's experiences during the 2010 8.8 Chilean earthquake. They filmed it in a lot of the same locations where the actual earthquake hit. The movie feels like a slasher version of your typical disaster flick with the earthquake and societal chaos being the movie's main villain.The film revolves around six travelers in Chile (Roth, Andrea Osvart, Nicolas Martinez, Ariel Levy, Lorenza Izzo and Natasha Yarovenko) partying at an underground nightclub in Chile when an earthquake hits. After first surviving the destruction of the club and making their way to the surface they realize they must also deal with the chaos outside, including escaped prisoners. Looting, rape, murder and other anarchy awaits them as they try to make their way to safety. A possible tsunami also looms. The tagline for the film is 'The only thing more terrifying than Mother Nature is human nature'.The movie is extremely grotesque and violent and was edited down from an NC-17 rating to it's commercial friendly R rated theatrical version. It's about what you'd expect from Eli Roth but not quite as clever or unique. I don't know Lopez or Amoedo's other work but I think this film would have been much better had Roth actually directed it. It would be nice to see him get back to directing again (he hasn't directed a feature since 2007's 'HOSTEL: PART II') instead of all this producing and acting he's been trying his hand at. He's not a great actor and neither is any of the rest of the cast. The movie has good moments but it's still little more than your average gore-fest horror film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH2nsN_uuBI"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Quite simply I have wasted 90 minutes of my life. Minutes I will never get back.This film was simply terrible. You spend the first 30 minutes (although it feels like hours) watching them being general tourists.Then an earthquake hits and it is pure chaos. Skip the tourism and it could be a one off thriller on TV.In general this just makes me want to shout at the TV because it is simply so poor. The actors barely speak English, it's 90% subtitles, they cannot act and this film drags to the point you can feel your IQ dropping. I'll admit it does attempt to become a thriller/horror after what feels like forever and the deaths are pretty gruesome but I definitely wish I had never of watched this film..."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Written and produced by Eli Roth who also acts as an actor, seemed interesting to watch and were expected to be shocking, with a slice of gore. I was not disappointed by watching it, as it really shocked me. So I could say it was very good film, but, only flaws I found were weak acting and in my opinion slow developing story, it was almost boring, but when shocking moment came I was pleased to witness shock after shock, and movie actually starts. It was not the greatest in the rhythm and how story develops, but it was not bad. If you are fan of Eli Roth work you will find how strong influence he had on making this film. What I liked here is very good made ending which is not happy, but reminds me somehow on ending of ""Planet of the apes"" original movie. I don't mean to compare those two, but in some way I found a slice of similarity. Gore did not have first perspective but there is enough of it, nicely tuned in. It could be made maybe much better, but the film is made well, with as I mentioned before some weak elements. Not bad choice for those striving for disaster movies with some twists and surprises."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Blood, rape, violence, and 3 minutes of Selena Gomez. Not much more to say, typical Eli Roth movie."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,That is a better way to describe this movie. It just didn't make it all the way into the horror genre in my opinion. It wasn't awful but the story line could've used some work. A lot of it was predictable and that kinda takes away from the suspense. This is a rainy day type of movie. Nothing to get overly excited about but it is a good watch for passing time.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,It was gorgy and kind of bloody but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It is to bad they didn't make it into a black comedy I hope Chile makes better movies that will be better.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,Takes thirty mins for something to Happen then it just showcases the nadir of South American existence. Pretty satisfying to see them all die though. Maybe they should build a wall around chille just to stop films like this ever escaping.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The film that dares to take the ""fun"" out of funicular.Three thoroughly detestable young men go on a clubbing spree in Chile. This exposition takes up at least 45 minutes of screen time, much of it set in dance clubs with loud music, flashing lights, booze, drugs, and terrible dancing. The three men reveal themselves to be almost unimaginably repetitive and boring. They meet three sad women. The entire sequence leaves the viewer feeling nauseous and hungover.Then, I guess, the real horror starts. There's an earthquake, and the town goes nutsy koo-koo. Our heroes quickly find themselves out of their depth. What follows is a bro-venture that gets a little sticky, hon. Very difficult to watch.The arc of this film is an arrow shot straight through sludge. The fates of the three dullards are not unexpected. Then we're left with the female characters, who are virtually indistinguishable. So bland and undeveloped were the women in this film that I had an extremely hard time figuring out who had been killed and who hadn't. Nor did I care.This film gets 3 stars because Nicolas Martinez is fun to watch."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I have to say that I saw this at FF Glasgow. It has taken me ages to review this title. Normally I see Eli Roth and think it is going to be a good laugh. This starts off like Hostel. Guys having a laugh in bars and trying to pull girls. There is half an hour of that and really I was in two minds whether I should walk out of the cinema. Then the earthquake hits and the movie starts to get really good. The scene in the night club is very engaging. The director shows what the mayhem would be like. Then when they get out of the club which seems to be 100 feet underground they go and try to get help. This is when it becomes boring and clichéd. If they had went through the fight for survival against natural means I would have given it an 8 out of 10.They chose the horror route. A group of nasties try to attack them. Limp and flaccid is the only way to describe this 35 minute section of the movie. It could have been good, it should have been good but in the end it was a noble failure."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,If you ever want to go to Central America you should not watch this film. It depicts exactly how these animals behave on a daily basis. Not just when a disaster happens. A the liberals let these human trash walk right through our southern border and ferry them into our country that is headed in the same direction. Sure there are some good people there. They are badly outnumbered by the hyper violent animals down in Central American though.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,Awful acting and a terrible plot. This film feels like a bunch of 16 drama students got drunk and tried to make a film.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"i don't understand the low rating that this movie is getting in IMDb. if you are looking for a cool movie, an edge of your seat suspense movie, and some moments of horror, then try this film, you wont be disappointed... do not listen to all these bitter people that try to demolish all films, for them no film is Worth watching, yes, of course all films have flaws, they are not perfect, they are made by another person, so the result will never be perfection...if God made films, then that would be something else...maybe then these idiots would be happy, they would put 10 out of 10 to everything.. a film is supposed to be entertaining, this film does that, i spent a very nice couple of hours and i don't regret it... highly recommendable!!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,Pass it by. Don't think that because Eli Roth is attached that it is watchable. A total waste of a horror movie and as a young adult travelogue to make you come and party in Chile. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth if you view it. (Where's the Listerine??) The only good is one of the character's beautiful eyes and one of the girl's short cute hair. The waste of time for the first hour was suppose to get you to like the characters. More like yawn-inducing. I almost thought it was misplaced in the horror genre and was a preteen angst movie. The effects are Airport 1970 and the acting is...Airport 1970. The ending is juvenile and you know how it's going to end except I thought it might end like Planet of the Apes. Now that would of been phenomenal.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Probably should have avoided it for the persistent Eli Roth involvement, but considering this is meant to be a disaster type movie, it was grotesquely over the top in terms of pointless gore and death, above and beyond what would be realistically expected in an earthquake.i'm not even someone who gets sick or repulsed by gore in movies but much like fudgy chocolate cake, if you eat fifty pounds of it in one sitting, you'll never want it again and you'll wish everything around you was dead.this film takes a tediously long period of time to actually get to its core concept, spending way too long to build up a group of barely likeable characters cruising around Chilean nightlife looking for parties and women. Eventually they meet up with a group of three women in a club, when the earthquake strikes.I would conceivably believe that this would be some manner of colossal earthquake never before seen in size and scope because the way it so easily rips apart structures to paper is obviously over the top and for dramatic effect. Chile is not a third world country, and yet the way the buildings crumble and infrastructure falls apart feels third world. There's even an overly long sequence showing some completely pointless rioting occurring despite at least two Tsunami Warnings.ultimately it's really difficult to overstate just how copious and pointless the gore in this really is. We get far too many instances of random stuff falling and crushing people in various ways, a completely pointless out of nowhere old woman getting hit in the face by a car after emerging from a manhole, and a painfully long, spotted 18 miles away sequence with a cable trolley full of old women and children that ends up crashing after the cable snaps and killing everyone inside. Or a fire truck randomly crashing into some wooden scaffolding and impaling the firefighters inside. Or a random group of gangsters torturing a guy half-crushed under concrete and raping a woman in front of him then setting him on fire. Or escaped prisoners somehow more interested in raping and looting and killing rather than trying to survive.It's painful because it's so copious and intense without any real purpose or even story in mind. None of the characters is particularly interesting or likeable, and there's no real plot beyond ""Go to a hospital somewhere and avoid contrived threats unrelated to the earthquake since, despite the title of the movie, there are apparently no aftershocks"".I would not at all disbelieve that this ""movie"" was nothing more than a framing device for a various assortment of torture and gore scenes that wouldn't fit in anywhere else.Going back to my original cake idea, if you like gore in movies, this movie is a gigantic cake made entirely of frosting. No matter how much you like frosting, at some point you're going to feel like utter sh*t"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The picture looked great and actually the acting was about as good as it could be with the lame predictable script. The character development was very forced and unrealistic even for this kind of film. Too many unnecessary characters and bar scenes were distracting (winery chick, bartender). Let me tell you that most people do not like to watch videos of other people on vacation but that is what you see for the longest time in the beginning.Special effects were excellent and is what made me continue to watch the film. It was difficult to make it through the first third of this film - it was laborious. This movie made the cardinal sin of being so boring for the first 30 minutes that I will never attempt to re-watch this without skipping the first third. Trust me you will not miss anything.Cut out the first third and downplay the forced stereotypical characterization and I would give it a 5."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 because it DOES very accurately show what being in the middle of a catastrophic (I'd say this was a 9.5+ sized quake) earthquake, the brutal casualties, and the near instant breakdown in society that would occur.What this movie does NOT do is provide any excitement or momentum. It is a gore splattered orgy of rape, torture and graphic violence, using no-name model types and one token pig fat guy.The movie starts off very slowly, following a group of 3 men on their Chile vacation as they plan a rock show and attend a rave. And a wine tour. Boring as heck. The dialog is cringy. For some reason Selena Gomez shows up randomly for 30 secs so our main guy can hit on her, then vanishes.Finally, after what seems an eternity, the earthquake hits. The earthquake is very realistic. Expect to see many many people crushed to pulp, decapitations, a guy losing his hand and everyone stepping on it, then the dogs run off with it. The 3 guys and their boopsy dates and the one 'normal' chick run for their lives to try to get handy to the hospital. But they run into a mob of escaped convicts instead, who proceed to rape the girls nearly to death and light one of the guys on fire with lighter fluid. Then a guy gets chopped up with an axe. This movie makes Texas Chainsaw Massacre seem like a Disney flick. This movie should have been rated 18A. Our characters run from one bloody horror scene to the next, with no plot, no direction, horrible acting and horrible lines. That's the movie. But you can't look away, it's like one gigantic train wreck, slowly drifting by..."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Okay, first and foremost, this is not a horror movie. Despite the presence of horror filmmaker Eli Roth, who co-wrote, co-produced, and co-stars, and the subsequent push from horror mags and websites, this is not a horror movie and you will be disappointed with it if you go in expecting one. I sure was.I'm not a huge fan of disaster films. They are, to me, to similar and too simplistic, basically just a series of movies about a group of desperate survivors moving from one really dangerous place to another, supposedly safer place. And, that is exactly what Aftershock is about. Not only that, Aftershock just isn't that great even viewed on those terms. Eli Roth plays a California white collar dolt vacationing in Chile with a couple buddies, locals, one a rich, boisterous tool and the other a heartbroken goof. These three are living their own version of the first half of Hostel Pt.1, spending all their time partying, getting drunk, getting high, and trying to get laid.These three are older than the guys in Hostel, but no more mature, and they're funny but not exactly likable. Neither are the trio of girls they hook up, European hotties, a party girl, a second, less trashy party girl, and the up-tight mother hen keeping an eye on the other two. The two groups get together at a trendy nightclub just as a massive earthquake rocks the city. From there, they set out into the streets, filled with desperate survivors and homicidal looters that escaped from a prison that collapsed nearby.The escaped convicts are the only horror element in Aftershock and it's a haphazard subplot at best, comprising only about 15 minutes of the movie's runtime. All this culminates in a finale that doesn't really work on a couple levels. The movie's budget keeps it from being all that visually impressive, although they do a lot with a little. There is some pretty brutal violence and unpredictable deaths, but there's not nearly as much carnage as you might expect, or hope for, from a movie with Eli Roth's involvement.I was generally entertained by Aftershock, but it didn't blow me away and, like so many modern flicks, it just feels kind of disposable. Everything that happens happens in ways that you've seen before and the movie fails to develop its own voice. Aftershock isn't bad, isn't great, it's just sort of in the middle, like almost everything else that is released now. Wait for the unrated BluRay."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Remember night of the living dead? The 1960s black and white that showed us humanity was its own worst enemy. Well what if zombies were an earthquake? Asked no one.In Eli Roth's laziest film a group of friends become trapped in a dangerous hellscape of greed and panic after a major earthquake. Sounds good? Don't worry. Eli makes sure to throw in a bunch of undeveloped blank criminals so he can film a few rape scenes and add a completely unbelievable and unnecessary purge vibe.The film had the chance to show how friends can turn on each or defend each other. Show the horror and danger of panic, rubble, desperation, and collapsing buildings. Instead it descends into a rapey slasher that leaves you wondering why you bothered watching the 3rd act.The entire under developed criminal sub plot that made the last 3rd could be cut and leave a haunting film about human responce to disaster. Where fear, uncertainty and nature are the most deadly enemy. But clearly Eli Roth is not capable of actual plot development here and just gave up. Even his signature gore is muted and dull here.Poorly shot, poor character development, terrible script and a predictable bad ending the only rattle in aftershock should come from you throwing it in the trash."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,Movie takes place in Chile. Makes it more thrilling. As he is travelling with his foreign friends. Never know what can go wrong when your out in a trip. The suspense reminds me a bit of Into the Blood with Gina Carano and Also the suspense of Eli Roth cabin fever. Not a bad film. At all. Believeable. Not your chick type film.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"I liked this film. It's not trying too hard to be something that it's not, working within it's limitations to create a suspenseful and chaotic movie. The characters are well developed (for a 1hr 30m movie) and all have distinctive and consistent personalities. I did not have English subtitles allowing me to appreciate the commendable acting effort. I also hadn't seen the trailer which appears to have ruined it for a lot of people. When considering how well received the likes of Cloverfield (7.1) and District 9 (8.0) are (Both of which I did not care for). I think this film is well underrated. I found it much more entertaining and a lot less predictable. This is my first review and I felt inspired to write it just because of the quantity of negative ones out there. For a film which is basically a high budget B-movie don't expect too much and enjoy."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Having just watched The Green Inferno, I had quite high expectations for this film with a largely similar cast. The trailer had me gripped, but it seems that the beginning of the film did not, spending a painfully long 30 minutes introducing the scene and characters. Once the earthquake hit, I was expecting to be thrilled...but I guess in comparison to The Green Inferno, I wasn't horrified by anything. Of course, there were a few moments of shock scattered throughout but more in terms of plot line as oppose to gore. It was, for the majority, very dark and uncomfortable to watch, but not in the way I would've liked. This was uncomfortable in the sense that I was so bored, you could say, that I wanted to turn off (but I always see a film through to the end). However, a particular highlight for me was the end scene. I smiled and said 'yessss', as although it was somewhat predictable, the film cleverly misleads you to believe there has been a 'happy' ending. Acting and special FX are good. For a new time gore watcher, this will be right up your street. However, for those experienced, it's nothing from the norm."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Remember all those disaster films you used to watch back then? Or seeing the wildly, notorious works of extreme horror icon Eli Roth? Well, mix these two and you get a little-reviewed shocker titled Aftershock (2012). The film describes a group of Americans who go sightseeing & partying in Chile until all hell breaks loose when an earthquake strikes the entire country as they must escape for safety & survival but it's not easy. While the first act just consists of the main cast enjoying their stay, I felt it was like those starts of Roth's previous films in which it wouldn't turn into a horror film after those grim opening credits until halfway through. By then, I quickly became (shockingly) entertained once the first earthquake sequence popped out of nowhere - becoming a suspense adventure that also became gory as well (along with few other twists). Not only it becomes that, the film also features a Spanish-language track (with subtitles) so it's little bit foreign since it was shot in the Latin countries & the film taking place there. However, I did enjoyed seeing Roth playing as one of the main heroes because he can do some good acting besides his filmmaking and he does look really handsome. If anyone thought he or this film didn't do well at the box office, then I might think I am the only one around who gave it a good review anyway. Aftershock is a good ""edge-of- your-seat"" suspense ride for those who like Roth or his works.My Rating: 4/5"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"And I like bad movies. (And I always click the ""spoilers"" box in case I spill something, but I always try to avoid spilling anything) I'm a fan of horror but not so much of simple splatter/gore, so thought that Eli Roth in an acting role might be interesting. But I still expected some splatter/gore, and there was some. About five minutes of it. Character development? Some sort of bonding? A villain who we hate but still can understand? Nope. The only good parts of this are in the first half hour, and these parts involve attractive, scantily clad women, and the writer's attempts at witty conversation between the men. Otherwise, absolute and utter crap. I feel like sending my electric company a little extra with my next bill to apologize for possibly taking away resources that someone else could have used to watch Ishtar or Bubba Ho-Tep or another awful film. Both of those--far, far better than Aftershock."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"This is one of the best disaster/horror movies I've seen for a long time. Someone was obviously paid to underrate the movie, because the movie of this category cannot earn 1 star.Someone obviously paid one of those Indian companies to give bad ratings to the movie. I'm not sure why, but it's obvious that a movie that should be at least 6.5 cannot ""spontaneously"" get a rating of 4.8.This is a much better movie than that shameful number you see. Acting is good and suspense will chain you to the screen. But don't believe me. Go see it yourself."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Well ... I always looking forward for Eli Roth's works. When I see the trailer I said ""WOW"". Then the movie comes out which I think similar to Hostel, friends in vacation with so long intro about the vacation. But the difference is ... it's not shocking like hostel did. Even I still had a goosebumps when I see hostel all over again.I think this movie lost the twist and less scary ... there's no horror in it and definitely boring all of the scenes. I think the interesting scene was when Monica caught by Tsunami by the end of the movie ... which is why the name is aftershock.Ah forget to mention Eli Roth's performance which is not bad. See the movie and judge by yourself."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,Beginning is nice. But the middle and the ending are ridiculous. Total waste of time. Doesnt make sense the reviews that has more the 2 stars. Pathetic
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"While this movie was not great, I thought it actually was a fairly decent attempt at a disaster movie. The acting is fairly solid, the cinematography is great, and the story line is decent w/one flaw towards the end. Not sure why the flaw was written into the story line as it almost comes out of no where and doesn't really fit, but its so close to the ending that most could probably overlook it. The movie is definitely worth viewing if your viewing options are limited. Eli Roth is not as bad as most would have you believe. The script is fairly solid, character development is adequate and there are some decent attempts at humor. All in all, it is worth the rental price."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The DVD cases calls this film a horror, I had to re check after watching the film in case I imagined it had said so...yep, it definitely state's HORROR, it's a pity the film makers didn't read the DVD cover before committing this film to the unsuspecting public.Don't get me wrong, the film is worth a watch just don't expect the wrath of god to destroy Chile because of some past misdemeanor by promiscuous nuns, it's no fire and brimstone epic, just 6 over aged (you've seen it all before - think hostel) backpackers, yawn, yawn, touring a country when an earth quake comes to town.The storyline and secondary actors are so telegraphed there's no Browne points for guessing the plot and who gets a grizzly end as the film progresses... throw in the unrealistic Olympian sprinting prowess of a couple of stiletto wearing women who put usan bolt to shame by out sprinting some Nike clad thugs down the cobbled streets even though at one point they could smell the salsa ladened thugs breath on their necks together with the absolute dire telegraphed ending which takes 5 minutes to play out and you have what promised to be a good film turn out to be rather a yawn fest."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Just one thing, never turn your back on the water..."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"You get it all! There is little left unseen in this movie. You get your token nudity, all the chicks are hot and so much gore and violence in general it will make you glad you were not there. I personally hate most activist groups and the like so watching them get potentially slaughtered and such was just an extra plus! The characters are believable and the acting is well done! The script is solid as well as the story line. This is in my opinion one of the best horror films to date and after watching it a few times now I honestly can say WELL DONE TO ALL! I cannot believe it gets such a low IMDb rating! What goes the extra mile here is that in so many other films done in this style (Cannibal Holocaust) with the same basic plot leave out details and back-story. This does not do so, you see every characters motives and thought processing, values and such. There is no thinking ""Hey they would not have done that"" or ""What the fxck are they doing?"" Nope, this is all done without overfeeding the audience such as the US version of Let the Right One In (which I would watch 10 times before watching the US Let Me In again.... which sucked in my opinion). It is a fine line of over doing things and subtly letting the audience know what is going on. This is done VERY well in The Green Inferno of not assuming we all are stupid and need a line scripted to let us know the non-verbals where we should have caught on such as the US version of The Girl with the Red Dragon Tattoo's line ""I hope you like anal sex."" The french version implied it very well and no actual verbal cue was needed. I could go on about Let Me In doing the same thing but will not since one could go on quite literally all night about such since there were SOOO many of them in that flick particularly. It is insulting and actually makes me angry that directors do this assuming people need such literal cues to catch on to things that they should just understand. So, with this film it was very refreshing that they let you infer such things as lesbians and that certain characters met an ill demise with no line like ""Oh they ate _____"" no we all are not stupid and can pay some attention to cues you film without the need of spoon-feeding. The ending left me a bit puzzled as to what was said in the interview of the main character. I suppose the sequel may explain since if you watch the credits there is a set up extra scene there. So again, this movie was well done and very well filmed/edited. This is what really puts it apart along with actors and actresses that can all sort of act well. Great job to the special effects people and overall although a stressful thing to produce in a taboo subject matter that will make most not like it etc. this is a gem! If you like gore and slasher films and are a classic horror movie type of watcher this is for you! It is much better than the crappy re-makes everyone is pumping out nowadays such as Evildead and Halloween - both of these re-makes I would have paid not to have seen but out of some misplaced curiosity from the great originals I watched anyway in dismal disgust. It is NOT just a Cannibal Holocaust re-make! We have something much much more useful here people! I doubt it will ever get the credit it deserves as a film in this genre due to it's subject matter. That being said though, it is a VERY under rated film with everything in place put into a believable situation with believable characters in a believable story line in great HD filming with believable special effects and it is edited great also which really does set it apart since most films of this subject or similar types lack in many of these departments. It also does a great job of driving home the abuse of female mutilations that third world countries actually do (those of us who are slightly studious and know a little of the world other than our own backyard will note these things are not made up) but again, due to the subject matter it is easy for most to look away in disgust and dismiss things rather than face them head on in the light of day so I doubt it will be credited for that either. Great job on so many fronts of unpleasantness and taboo subject matter! Well done I can not say this enough! Scary, gross and very real feeling!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"i think Eli Roth gets a raw deal, someone doesn't like him, or is a really bad advertiser??? this movie is really scary, and good! it is very real in terms of what people do in times of catastrophe....sad, but scary!! this movie never came to a theater here, i know trhat. i saw Eli""s other flick, Green Inferno and omg! that movie led me to the advertizsment for this one. they both are so great i bought them both on DVD! PLUS the actress that plays monica is so beautiful! you actually root foe all of these people cuz they are so much like everyone else. so much like one of you in cases of emergency. everyone did a great job! 10 stars!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"After watching the trailer of this film, i was really excited to watch the film. I don't have a problem with gore. Loved the Hostel series by Eli Roth. But i was really disappointed to see this film, in fact I hated this movie. So much could have been done with the plot and the script of the movie. But in the end it was like being on a swing, you really don't go anywhere, just back n forth. The effects of earthquake are shown really well, but then that's only shown well. Nothing more from mother nature except for the giant wave in the end. And as per Human nature to be depicted, it went terrible. The acting was fine. Effects were good. It was gory as expected. Film makers need to realize that in the end, we do not want to go home with a bad taste in our mouth every time."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Without sounding totally biased, this has to be the single worst film I have ever seen. Each section was predictable to the point it was ridiculously cliché. From start to finish it was one pointless action after another. It felt like a chore just to see it to the end. The beginning drags on and still fails to help you build a relationship with any character. Throughout you feel yourself laughing at parts you shouldn't because you can't help but think 'Who would do that?'Apparently according to IMDb I have to write two more lines before this review can be posted, but honestly I could have summarised this film in 2 words.Seriously save yourself one and half hours of utter dross!"
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"OK so this title gets only 1 from me. The title makes you think of earthquakes etc. but the first half of the film is where you watch a group of friends go partying, pick up girls, and a cat fight between two sisters in which one is revealed to have had an abortion *shock gasp horror*. Majority of the film needn't have been made, as it's totally pointless to the plot. The movie is poorly thought out, and the acting in it is OK at best. The film follows a group of friends who have been partying, then an earthquake hits. There is then a tsunami alert for the town, and everyone scrambles to higher ground. Then it turns out the earthquake destroyed a prison, and all the prisoners have escaped. There is a rape scene that needn't be in the film, as it's again pointless. The ending is even worse in my opinion and it's not a movie I would recommend to anyone to watch. It is definitely not a horror movie, but then hardly fits in to the disaster movie category either, as there are so many things attempting to go on at once that majority of the movie is totally pointless.Watch this only if you want to donate an hour and a bit of your life that you don't want."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Aftershock is disgusting, dirty, decadent, it shows the worst instincts of human beings. Acting is very bad, scenes are extremely strong and the entire film is completely negative. From the first scene to the last one. I was extremely shocked to see how can producers spend a lot of money on a film that has absolutely nothing positive. No message, no respect, no shooting quality, a completely terrible script etc."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Eli Roth has done it again. 'Aftershock' is an unpredictable roller coaster ride of a film.the first 30 minutes or so is spent setting up the story and introducing us to the characters. a lot of people say this part was boring but I disagree. the rest of the movie wouldn't have any psychological impact if we didn't care about the characters. this part of the film plays like 'The Hangover' in Chile. And there's some great laughs, especially from Roth's character.But once the madness starts... it never ends. I can't stress how crazy this movie gets. Terrible things happen, in the most disturbing ways possible. the film is extremely dark, but still manages to also be fun and entertaining.some might call this movie cruel and excessive, and honestly, its hard to argue against that. but if you're a horror fan, and you're looking for an entertaining movie, I can't recommend this enough. also, the ending is incredible.if there's one word to describe this movie, its RIDICULOUS. and I mean that in a good way."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"A very long, drawn out, protracted, undiluted sulphuric acid bath would have been preferable to having to endure this complete waste of time and money. Perhaps the producers should have considered donating the money they spent on this disaster(of a) movie to tsunami or earthquake victims instead of churning out this pointless, charmless, abhorrent nonsense.This film lacks pretty much every element a quality horror or disaster film should include. The build up of tension and suspense is completely ignored or handled so badly that it is likely most viewers will be more concerned by how they may be travelling home than anything on screen. The small twist is so laughably transparent and pointless the writers could have left the character out of the script entirely.The tone of the film does not seem to have been considered at all. We are treated to effects that are at times deliberately (I hope)comical which is in stark contrast to the needless, protracted and graphic rape scene and unnecessary cheap shock shots of dead babies.It has been a long time since a film got my back up as much as this and I find it amazing that it was ever released."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,If you really do the timeline of the movie a tsunami wouldn't take 12 hours to hit. Also wheres the rain if it was a tsunami? The wind? You literally had nothing to convince me it was a tsunami. Now you had me convinced it was a creature or something else that would've have been a nice twist since everyone thought it was a tsunami. But that ending was horrible.the killings very nice. Other than that it was boresville. I'm sorry. My dreams make better nightmares.
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Aftershock is written and directed by Nicolás López (Eli Roth takes a co-writing credit) who uses true stories of the real 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chile in 2010 as the basis for his survival film, and filmed it in a lot of the same locations where the actual earthquake hit. Aftershock is a disaster movie highlighting how human nature can be more terrifying than Mother Nature. The story follows with three friends on holiday in Chile: Pollo (Nicolás Martínez), Gringo (Eli Roth) and Ariel (Ariel Levy),while checking out the local nightlife they get caught in the society-dissembling effects of an earthquake, but to make matters worse the local prison has been demolished too, and the convicts are roaming the streets. Their Chilean misadventures are now truly horrifying. Pollo, Gringo and Ariel must now evade looters, rioters and a whole assortment of terrors, with three young women they have just met, while a group of convicts hunt them across the city. The chaos on screen is well done and is the film's strongest element. The effects, kills and gore were excellent, but were just too random and sporadic to be taken seriously. More conflict was needed in the first act to grab one viewer's attention and it probably would have been much better if you just skipped the first 20min and get right into the earthquake and what follows. Although the story and characters become a bit predictable, with a couple of plot holes here and there, it still is an entertaining film to watch and more so if you enjoy Roth's work."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The settings on location were interesting. So much for positive reaction. The character development was woefully short. Even though the majority of the characters in a film may be shallow, there need to be at least a couple who serve as a counter- balance to the others. The plot for the first fifteen minutes left me hanging on only to see whether it might pick up later. It did eventually, but by then our interest was seriously lagging, particularly in light of the gratuitous vulgarity (crotch photo and use of the ""F-bomb""). I have no tendency to ""spoil"" endings. In this instance it would be impossible, as we left at the end of the first half hour. The only other time in my life I have done so was when we watched ""Kung Pow."" Ouch! Unless the snacks are far better than usual, I would recommend saving the entertainment funds for use elsewhere."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Eli Roth keeps making poor fiction and, somehow, I keep getting duped into watching his pro-antagonistic crap. There are numerous things wrong with this story. That is not a spoiler. You know that is true before you ever start watching am Eli Roth film. My problem with his story telling is that the bad folks never appropriately suffer for their evil deeds. Final consequence never seems to reach them, while the protagonists drop dead in the worst way imaginable. SPOILER! The murder gang never really dies on film. It can be assumed that they continue to rape, plunder, and murder, long after the last victim dies. In truth, the bad guys suffer no real consequences for being evil. Sure, a few are killed, but most of them are not, plus there is a reasonable possibility the escape the tsunami as well. There are a few film makers who have managed to get a foothold in Hollywood that no amount a consumer frustration can pry loose. Here is a man who might have done very well in another career, but is sadly trapped in the realm of mediocre film making. The whole point of his films seems to be making good people suffer, and I am not talking about the protagonist; I'm talking about you and me."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"No writer should ever produce a work with absolutely zero consolation. I gave it two stars because I have to admit before the quake, I found it somewhat amusing. But after, there was nothing but profound tragedy, and not one good thing to help compensate for it. Movies are entertainment. I was totally bummed after watching this nightmare. Eli Roth deserved to burn for this one."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"The movie takes 34 minutes to start, then it jumps into a repeating cycle of1. Main character takes a major injury2. They try to get help3. They cant find help, but the person dies anywayThis happens at least 3 or 4 times.The dumbest / funniest part though: the fireman, who has followed and helped them the whole time, takes off his coat, and the girl sees his tattoos, and they both just agree he's a bad guy now, so he kills her."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Campy disaster movies are great. This was one of the worst, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time, I read the reviews and was not dissuaded, bad move."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"So disappointed in this piece of garbage, partly because I have a massive crush on Eli Roth. The whole time I was thinking how could this guy lower himself to be in such a juvenile horror flick? The movie was gory to the point of absurdity, with body parts flying around and heads being knocked off. You know when this movie would be a good one to watch? When you're sitting around with a bunch of friends, maybe having had a little too much to drink, and you want to hoot and holler and laugh. If that's the case, then this is your movie."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Aftershock is titled well. It is grotesque for the hell of it , some of the ""shocks"" are unnesscary. It had potential if it didn't veer off into torture porn and dead kids."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Believe me, I've seen many god awful films.But this is absolutely rubbish. Never make a Eli Roth movie if you're not Eli Roth."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"If you're looking for a horror movie where things are hopeless, you've come to the right place.Strengths of this movie are the brutality and darkness of the whole environment. But what really strikes a cord with me is that why watch a horror movie, if everyone just dies at the end? If everyone just dies, what's the use of spending 2 hours of your life in false suspense?If you want a dark movie and want to see likeable charcters meet gruesome fates they really don't deserve: go ahead and watch it!Personally, wish I never watched this movie. Waste of my time. Go watch SAW if you want a decent movie where characters with moral convictions die according to what they deserve....with alot less gore."
唐山大地震,Aftershock (2012),,2012,2010.12.29,"Thank you for gathering the worst of humanity's shortcomings and putting them in a film for every loser, lowlife and idiot to watch and aspire to. I cannot believe anyone actually 1. paid $$ to produce this and 2. paid $$ to see it. Producers and directors, you are horrible human beings. Actors, seriously? This is what you chose to get your start??"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Big budget WWII epic , it happens when China is invaded by Japan at the onset of war and finds Japanese army surrounding city of Nanjing (1937). After that, at the city take place violations, mutilations, and massacres. Some prisoners are interred in a prison camp but later they are led to fire squad, scaffold and alive burying.Director deglamorizes war showing true horror and terrible events. It's a staggering evocation of the Chinese Holocausto in Nanjing , as the atrocities are depicted matter of factly as by-product of sheer Japanese evil. The opening twenty minutes graphic depiction the facing off is , on its own, magnificent. The film-maker Chuan Lu is nicknamed the Chinese Steven Spielberg for his spectacular and impressive productions. As the moving beginning results to be as stirring as ¨Saving private Ryan¨ , the developing of the movie regarding invasion China is partially similar to ¨Empire of the sun¨ and suffering of Chinese people bear remarkable resemblance to Jews of ¨Schlindler list¨ .The starring, Nakaizumi, and the rest of the cast are excellent , as the movie is powered by splendid performances in charge of Chinese and Japanese actors who during filming suffered some inevitable discussions. Filmed in perfect black and white by cameraman Cao Yu , reflecting appropriately the grim and rotten environment .Lu Chuan makes a breathtaking work which directs spectacularly with groundbreaking scenes in a heartbreaking context.Chuan dedicated about three years joining information and interviewing experts for that scenes would adequate to reality of events. This masterpiece finally garnered the world attention and respect that the story deserves, winning several prizes in various International Festivals."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The last Rape of Nanking event film I had watched, was the docu-drama Nanking back in 2006 during the Hong Kong International Film Festival. With interviews conducted with real survivors, I was riveted to listen to their account of the atrocities conducted by the Japanese soldiers, and you empathize with them as they relive their memory and make them known. The dramatic elements were nicely presented as well, with notable names reading off memoirs and letters pertaining to individual episodes, which collectively make up the brutal horror, a living hell if you would, of the conditions of occupation.Lu Chuan of Kekexili fame has crafted this fine film that looks into 2 broad episodes – the first few hours of occupation which will satisfy action junkies, and the later half which looked into the atrocities that were committed some 1 week into occupation, from within an international safety zone set up by Westerners, led by German John Rabe, who gets some concession by virtue of Nazi Germany being Japan's ally.There's the controversial aspect of the film though, where it doesn't demonize the invading force right away. Instead, I lauded its realistic portrayal of the human condition of Fear when we go into the unknown, and this emotion gets vividly captured in the first few minutes of the movie, setting the tone of the entire film, where fear drives us to do inhumane, barbaric acts. That being said, it doesn't shy away from reenacting the atrocities committed against the Chinese, from bayonet stabbings, mass burials of breathing souls, burning and the machine gunning of surviving soldiers, and rape.Filled with plenty of characters each given a specific purpose in the film, either representative of an historical legend, or collectively as a group, it makes you feel for the individual with documentary-like precision, and I am somewhat intrigued at how one can feel so much through the simple camera work of going real close to the actor's face, and lingering onwards to capture moments of despair and bewilderment.If there's one film you should see this year, then don't miss this one. I only hope that it gets played in a decent cinema hall with a great sound system, otherwise it'll do this film no justice. Certainly a contender for one of my films of the year, and comes highly recommended!"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH is a masterpiece - of film making, of finding the midline of response to war from both sides, of cautiously but successfully blending intimate stories with the gory atrocities of war, and of recreating a period of history we too soon forget unless prodded by works such as this. Lu Chuan both wrote and directed this vision of the 1937 decimation of Nanking, the capital of China, by the Japanese that lasted in action for only six weeks but that has been a permanent festering wound on the history of mankind that will always be a reminder to what War is about. Subtitled NANKING! NANKING! the audience is led to expect a film honoring the Chinese who bravely fought to resist of the Japanese invasion and ultimate destruction of the then capital of China. Instead the writer/director elects to put us in the midst of the war, showing all aspects of how war changes and affects and destroys people. The black and white film is able to create the illusion that we are actually in 1937 Nanking. We meet several important personalities from that time: the Chinese Resistance leader Lu Jianxiong (the inordinately gifted and handsome actor Ye Liu), the Chinese schoolteacher Miss Jiang (Yuanyuan Gao) who fights constantly to save her people, the Nazi German John Rabe (John Paisley) who maintains a Safety Zone to protect the Chinese until the Nazis recall him to avoid insulting their Japanese allies, Rabe's Chinese assistant and translator Mr Tang (Wei Fan) and his wife (Lan Qin) who despite the suffering they endure from the Japanese still are selfless in the choices they make to help their people, and Kadokawa (and impressive Hideo Nakaizumi) who as a Japanese soldier is a symbol for those warriors who are conflicted about the cruelty inflicted on the Chinese. These individuals provide stories with the story that allow the viewer to connect to the human aspect of the victims and the perpetrators of the annihilation we are witnessing. There are devastating scenes of the forced 'comfort houses' created to keep the Japanese soldiers happy, the demanded selection of 100 Chinese women to provide physical gratification to the enemy, the massacre of thousands of citizens - men, women, children - and the destruction of the very city itself. But Lu Chuan balances these with some very tender moments, such as the first sexual encounter of a virgin soldier with a prostitute and how he interprets this experience as love to the point of providing as much gratitude and safety to the prostitute as he can, and the incredibly tender scenes between Lu Jianxiong and a little boy who brings him bullets. The cast is stunning and while many of us do not recognize the faces, they are obviously some of the cream of the crop of Chinese and Japanese actors. Yu Cao is in charge of the very realistic and photographically perfect cinematography and the musical score by Tony Liu is not only appropriate for the theme of the film but also provides some very simple Western piano music for the intimate scenes. There are multiple choices of subtitles including English. CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH not only documents a piece of martial history that is important to remember, but it is also another way of viewing how WAR can alter the minds and lives of those on both side of the battle. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I finished watching this film two hours ago and the punch in the stomach I received watching it still hurts. I don't recall having received such a punch in my 60 or so years of film watching. Unlike films such as ""Schindler's List"" or ""Empire of the Sun"", this film does not take sides. It's like a candid camera operated by an invisible grand master hidden in the crowd or the rubble. It's just there recording events. As a result, despite the fact that it focuses on the big picture, the individual is not lost: Both the Chinese and the Japanese, each and every one of them, in huge crowds are real believable characters. This gives the viewer a grand and horrible sense of presence which is what makes it so painful. It would take courage to watch it again."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 (Market screening) Since I am not Chinese, or of Chinese extraction, City of Life and Death has a different resonance for me. I know of the Nanking massacre (for which, it has to be said, the Japanese have yet to apologise or even properly acknowledge) from my own interest in history, as well as the John Rabe story (the Nazi who helped save thousands of Chinese civilians, until recalled to Germany since Hitler did not wish to upset his Japanese allies).Therefore, for me, City of Life and Death retells a fearful part of history, but not one with which I have any direct connection. So while this film may resonate a certain way for Chinese viewers, be they from the mainland, Hong Kong or overseas Chinese, I can tell you that I, as a European, have seldom seen a film so powerful, gripping, dramatic and moving.City of Life and Death is not nationalistic propaganda or a reversioning for the screen: no punches are pulled. The woman next to me was in tears. So be warned, this is not easy viewing. But by featuring on a few characters, allowing them to become fully three-dimensional human beings (not Chinese, not Asian, but human beings who live, love and feel) director Lu Chuan makes his audience feel and share their fear and terror as the Japanese invaders commit atrocity after atrocity on the fallen city's inhabitants. Never forget, this actually happened.If anything, Lu Chuan soft pedals on the horrors. They are depicted, but are not front and centre. This is not a horror film so gore hounds and ghouls should seek their thrills elsewhere. Rather, it is the arbitrariness with which the Japanese went about their murderous work that scares. Wrong place, wrong time: rape, torture, murder. This wasn't the efficient, methodical murder the Nazis introduced, but rather cold brutality, as a cat toys with a helpless mouse. Unthinking, unreasoning, just because.Filmed in black and white, City has so many images and scenes that remain fixed in you mind long after the final credits have rolled. Lu Chuan even selects the grain and grading according to the action. The use of colour would, in this case, have weakened the film.But if City of Life and Death were just two hours of suffering it would be unworthy of an audience. So Lu Chuan gives us the central characters of Mr. Tang (John Rabe's secretary), Miss Jiang (a schoolteacher) and Kadokawa (a sensitive Japanese soldier who witness but cannot delay the unspeakable). All of them are helplessly swept up in the maelstrom, which Lu Chuan leavens with scenes of (attempts at) normal life, normal human interaction and naked attempts at survival. These are people with whom one can identify and empathise.Yet, at heart, City of Life and Death is extremely uplifting. The message, at the end, is positive and optimistic. In writing this review, the film is coming back to me again. What I once read, black and white on a page, has been made real for me and, yes, I'm emotionally moved by it.If you believe in the power of film, want a break from popcorn entertainment, are looking for a film that can make you feel (as opposed to having your emotions manipulated) then please go see this one. It's rare when I think a film should be seen, deserves to be seen, but City of Life and Death belong in that very rare category."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"A very fine movie, strong and rather heavy. I was relatively familiar with the events that took place in Nanjing therefore I was not surprised by the atrocities I saw reenacted on the big screen.The device of shooting the film in black and white was effective, in the sense that it created an impression akin to a documentary or a current affairs reportage of the age. Alessandro Ahmenabar may have said that he wanted ""Agora"" to give the impression that it reported events from 4th century A.D. Alexandria like a CNN live correspondence but I think ""The City of Life and Death"" was the movie that succeeded on that, giving to the spectator the impression of watching the events in live coverage.Although it portrayed numerous atrocities, it masterfully avoided the trap of succumbing to ""pornography of violence"". It also tried to treat the incidences of mass rape and ""comfort women"", which after all are the reasons that the conquest of Nanking became notorious and was named The Rape of Nanking, in a relatively discreet manner, the only one possible.The actors were expressive and one must note that this multi-person drama, lacking a protagonist was reminiscent of the technique of the films of Robert Altman also lacking a protagonist.It was also a good idea to create a positive and repentant Japanese character in order to alleviate the obnoxious impression that the viewer would form about the Japenese people in general.I do not know whether there is a propaganda value in this movie but judging it a work of art, being not involved in Sino-Japanese affairs, I find it outstanding."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I'm an overseas Chinese, growing up listening to my grandfather telling the stories about how bad the Japanese Military treating the Chinese people in WWII.I saw some of the movies made back in the 80's/90's about the rape of Nanking, to me they are exploitation movies and never affected me or leave me with profound experience. I'm actually disgusted with them making such low movies. Also most of the documentaries I watched never really does anything.I watched Nanjing! Nanjing! - City of Life and Death tonight and it really drained me emotionally, the movie really depicting the real face/real ugly side of war, where the victims are always the people, doesn't matter what wars or which countries.The movie itself doesn't really do the finger pointing like other movies, but it just showing, in my opinion, the fair view on what was going on back then without taking sides.And it's show one thing, the most profound thing to me, that The Chinese people can endure a lot of hardship that life throw at them and that's possibly why their cultures and civilization last for a long time.Highly recommended for people who never really know this part of history, as Chinese I know about it, but for lot of my westerners friends who never been to China, they only heard about it but didn't realize how crazy it was and how significant is this event for the Chinese people. Most people know the atrocities the Nazis did in WWII, but not the Japanese Atrocities.Watched it and let's pray there won't be WW III or any wars at all actually."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I've been really impressed by this film. The way it makes a contrast between the fragility of the Chinese position and the vast and enormous military resources at the hands of the Japanese to simply dispose of the Chinese population just the way they want, remorseless and unlimited in their decisions, creates in the spectator a sense of utter despair and impotence, as the starting violence and euphoria transforms into raw and premeditated brutality. But this same perspective makes you appreciate more intensely the triumph of the defeated's mentality over the conquerors' one, the silent resistance that becomes an unified wall against the oppression and ruthless rule of the Japanese military, whom at the end began to fall apart morally. The action is awesomely captured, photography is great, and direction is remarkable, some scenes hit you really hard, but not to the extent to consider it a sadist or heavy-to-watch film. Henceforth, one of my favorites war movies of all time."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Chuan Lu, the talented director of 'City of Life and Death', was faced with a quandary in attempting to recount the ""Rape of Nanking"", perhaps the single greatest series of atrocities committed by the Japanese occupation force during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Just as the Jewish people always say ""never forget"" when it comes to remembering the Holocaust, the Chinese people also feel compelled to ""never forget"" and recall their own Holocaust. But Mr. Lu can't ignore the fact that the Japanese people of 1937 are not the same people of today, and his compulsion to reconcile the past and the present was perhaps his greatest challenge in writing the screenplay.Ironically, Lu ended up receiving death threats, not from the Japanese but from some Chinese people who felt that he did not extract a sufficient enough ""pound of flesh"" as compensation for those who suffered during the Occupation. I can recall my own grandparents, who had relatives that were killed in the Holocaust, speak ever so harshly of the Germans and wanted nothing to do with any of them—even those born after the War. Because it was an emotional issue, they ignored the Biblical admonition found in Ezekiel 18:20: ""The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity"". The same can be said for many Chinese people who are unable to forgive the Japanese, even though rationally it makes no sense that those born after the war are blamed for their parents or grandparents' crimes. While Director Lu's reconciliation strategy is a noble one, I'm not completely convinced the way he went about expressing his attitude of 'forgiveness' toward the Japanese, enhanced the story, strengthening its verisimilitude.Where the film is successful, is in the multitude of indelible images that re-create the horror show that was 1937 Nanking. The images from the film's opening sequence are shattering as they suggest an escalating atmosphere of terror that affected both the Chinese civilian and military population . One image that really sticks in my mind are the Chinese soldiers trying to escape the walled city and are unsuccessfully held back by their commanders. For those soldiers who stayed behind, they're shown to be courageous as they fight back against an overwhelmingly superior force. When they are finally defeated and surrender, the brutal Japanese soldiers take no prisoners. Some are herded into a warehouse with the doors locked shut and then the building is set on fire. Others are marched to the ocean and almost all are machine-gunned to death. Before they're murdered, the soldiers shout ""Long live China"" and again show their courage against their brutal occupiers.Worse is what happens to the civilian population, especially the Chinese women. The Japanese force the leaders in the 'Safety Zone' (an area where refugees were supposedly protected by an agreement with international observers) to select 100 women to serve as prostitutes over a period of three weeks for the Japanese soldiers. The women are strapped to beds and are raped continuously through the day and night. Some fail to survive the ordeal and who can forget the scene where the soldiers carry out the nude corpses in a wheelbarrow? The strategies of the Japanese troops recall the sadism of their Nazi counterparts in the book & film, 'Sophies Choice'. You'll recall that Sophie was forced to select one of her children over another by the Nazis. In Nanking, the Japanese play their own little sadistic game—they lead families to believe that their loved ones will be let go—but then order the families to choose only one! Of all the characters here, Mr. Tang is the most compelling. Tang was John Rabe's interpreter and assistant. When Rabe informs him that he's being recalled back to Germany, Tang makes a pact with the devil by informing the Japanese commanders that there might be Chinese soldiers hiding out in the safety zone; he does this to obtain a safe conduct pass in order to save his family. This admission creates the pretext for the occupiers to violate the agreement and invade the safety zone in order to commit more atrocities. Tang soon learns that the Japanese had no intention of honoring their side of the bargain and a Japanese soldier ends up throwing Tang's daughter out the window. In an act of redemption, Tang trades places with a soldier and remains behind as his wife escapes when she leaves Nanking with John Rabe.Lu is unsuccessful when he attempts to throw a bone to the Japanese people of today by creating the unconvincing character of Kadokawa. According to Lu, he based Kadokawa's character on diaries he read of Japanese soldiers who were in Nanking during the massacres. Although there may have been a few soldiers who were repulsed by what they saw, the vast majority were more like Ida, Kadokawa's sadistic direct superior. Lu has trouble fleshing out his Kadokawa character—he shows his sensitive side to a Japanese 'comfort girl' who he claims that one day she'll be his wife. And later, Kadokawa shoots Miss Jiang as a mercy killing and then does himself in, as he is unable to cope with his guilt. But it's really not enough—Kadokawa is an anachronistic presence, designed to suggest that Japanese people weren't that bad, even back then. But in 1937, the mindset of the average Japanese person, was decidedly quite fanatical.What Lu merely needed to do was put a disclaimer at the beginning of the film, noting that Japan transformed itself after the War and that the son should not pay for the iniquity of the father. Without Kadokawa (or perhaps having him as a greatly reduced presence), 'City' would have been much more true to life and there would have been no misunderstanding Lu was blaming the Japanese born after WW II, who bear no responsibility for the bloody scenes that happened so long ago."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"It is said that evil can only manifest itself when we do nothing to stop it. When we simply allow for it to happen whether in our lives or in the lives of others. The Japanese soldiers who invaded Nanking justified their horrific acts by claiming pride and duty towards their beloved country. Barbaric and without mercy, these troops of doom descended upon the city like the worst nightmare ever conjured by humans. Imagine an army of serial killers and rapists wreaking havoc without being reined in and you'll get an idea. Kudos and hats off to the director for having the courage to bring this shameful blemish in world history to life. Unflinching, painful and without apologies."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The atrocities committed in Nanking, the capital of China, by the Japanese in 1937 and 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War is a source of anger and resentment today.All kinds of torture were visited upon the residents, including live burials, mutilation, ""death by fire"", ""death by ice"", and ""death by dogs"". A survivor testifies to a killing contest amongst a group of Japanese soldiers to determine who could kill the fastest. The rape that occurred during the massacre was one of the greatest mass rapes in world history. It is estimated that the number of women raped ranged from 20,000 to as many as 80,000, and women from all classes were raped, including Buddhist nuns. Furthermore, rape occurred in all locations and at all hours, and both very young and very old women were raped. Not even pregnant women were spared. It wasn't limited to women as some men were forced to commit incest—fathers to rape their own daughters, brothers their sisters, sons their mothers.Writer-director Chuan Lu and cinematographer Yu Cao joined to present a film that was stunning and mesmerizing. They say that war is hell, and they were certainly describing what went on here. One does not have to understand a word of Japanese or Chinese to follow what is going on.The pain was more than evident and the horror is indescribable."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"** The spoilers contained are not really spoilers, just a very brief mention of a couple of scenes**As both a history nerd and a war movie freak, I was rather surprised to discover both a part of history, as well as this movie, and realize that I have hardly heard anything about the rape of Nanking, not by a word mentioned in any history lesson nor school literature in Sweden, where I live. I haven't seen many books about it either, during my years of devouring all literature about WWII and wars in conjunction with it. Sad, but it gave me the more reason to learn about the Sino-Japanese wars. This movie, I guess, was the introduction. The mixed reviews were rather confusing but I chose to go with the general trend, that it was see worthy. It was.Seldom I have been so completely punched down by a Movie, and so utterly engrossed. Everything about this flick just sucks you in, and shakes you up entirely.The black and white execution can, I guess, be a bit different, for watchers not used to old b&w movies, and definitely pretty unusual nowadays. But as I see it, this is one of the most important features of the movie, giving a raw, documentary, and very authentic feel to it. A very smart move by the director, giving the impression that what you are watching, is a piece of naked at-the-scene history. Still, the visual of the movie never loses it's insanely beautiful and powerful cinematography, with every frame In-Your-Face, smashing you like a fist of master photo. The actor portraits are strong, convincing and complex, and lets you feel and wonder, rather than just being fed, evolving and revealing more and more as the story unravels. Some critique Nakaizumi Hideo's rendition of Kadokawa, but I don't get it. IMO he does an amazing job, and makes me believe, and feel, him. Often, western viewers, have a hard time getting used to Asian film, which, according to me, has to do with the fact that western and Asian storytelling and dramaturgy traditionally differ a little bit, which of course is completely natural. In many Asian flicks I think the acting and scripts can feel a bit melodramatic for a western viewer. (Not for me though, as a long time fan of Asian film.) In this movie, however, not a trace of that can be detected. The form of this epic piece of film history, is rather the mellow and minimalistic storytelling of old, classic war drama, like for an example, the excellent Finnish ""The unknown soldier"" (by Edvin Laine, 1955, about another rather unknown part of WWII - the Finnish wars).The score and sound is also powerful, and adds to the air created, and a couple of scenes are epic, unforgettable, in their perfect harmony of visual, score and emotional strength (the scene with the climb to the top to oversee the field of corpses, and the scene with the ritualistic dance). Scenes that makes one shiver to the core - pure cinematic ecstasy.The story is simple, yet so dense of emotion and complexity, in it's slow pacing leading to a inevitable climax. Never pointing fingers, never glorifying, never picking sides. Just showing the horror of war, naked and raw, never glutting in blood, misery and atrocity, nonetheless giving a deep impact on the Viewer.This movie is NOT overrated by the people calling it a genuine masterpiece, because it IS. A powerful, haunting rendition of a horrific piece of history, with believable portrayals of HUMANS rather than sides. Humans affected by, and changed by, war. Beautifully told in it's awfulness.In a word; fantastic."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This grim and depressing black-and-white drama explores the Rape of Nanking and is told from the point of view of the oppressed Chinese trapped within the city (oh, and from the point of view of one of the occupying Japanese soldiers too, purely for balance). As a film, it occupies the same kind of gut-wrenching worthy territory as SCHINDLER'S LIST, depicting a series of increasingly harrowing events in which violence is meted out as a matter of normality.I always find such films hard to enjoy, and I hardly want to watch them again after sitting through them. Nevertheless, they exist purely to tell their story and to ensure that such pivotal moments in history are never forgotten.CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH gets everything right: the direction, which emulates a cinema verite style on occasion, is highly effective and the narrative consists of just the right scope. The acting, too, is of a high calibre and the ensuing drama is as gritty and disturbing as you'd expect given the subject matter; there's certainly no sugar coating here."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I'm a Chinese, I live in Nanjing.Since i was in primary school, i've watched a lot of movies about the slaughter in Nanjing in 1937. We've been told and taught that 300,000 Chinese were killed in that slaughter, most of them were refugees. We've seen so many cruel photos, read so many articles, and heard the vivid reports of some survivals, which has made 1937's Nanjing a scar on the heart of every Chinese, especially the old ones who witnessed the slaughter, and their descendants.I don't want to talk too much about the hates between Chinese and Japanese. Why I think ""Nanjing! Nanjing! "" the greatest movie about this tragedy, is that when LU Chuan shot this movie, he not only put away his hates, but even used an angle of a Japanese soldier, and dared to show the soldier's sympathy and humanity. This movie is logical, rational and together with deep emotion. It's not simply a movie for Chinese people to deepen their hates on Japanese, it's a movie for people all over the world to see, to know, to experience and to explore what Japanese have done to Nanjing in 1937. It's not another traditional movie about Nanjing Slaughter which describes Japanese soldiers as some mentally disordered ones, as demon; it shows that what happened in Nanjing in 1937 was simply a slaughter human done to human. Just because this movie was shot without hates without slants without sharp emotions, it has demonstrated the most powerful thing in the world: truth.Nanjing, 1937, not matter Japanese admit its existence or not -- we may forgive, but never forget."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The story of the first six months or so of the Rape of Nanking in 1937 and 1938. We begin with the battle for the city, from there we witness the fall of Chinese forces and the Japanese attempts to take the spoils of war. Most of the film is the attempts of the population to simply survive. Its is a heart rending tale about death, the destruction and rebirth of the human spirit and of life. Its is a deeply moving episodic tale and one of the best films of the year.Where do I begin? Perhaps with the beautiful black and white photography that paints a haunting picture of life and death. Color is wildly over rated and the simple black and white images allow so much more to be said. Color would simply have gotten away. This is a film where every image is a masterpiece. Its a film that should be hung on the wall, even the death and destruction because its so beautiful. and that is kicker, even though the images are so beautiful they are deeply deeply troubling. We are moved even though somethings are too pretty, or perhaps because they are. The director and his crew are clearly aware they are making a movie, watch the drum ritual in the last part of the movie, there is no doubt that this is a movie and yet you are moved by the images. No you are moved by the story and the people in the images, by using the medium we have a film that is in some ways more real then a straight documentary would have been.The film often takes the form of a documentary.. The camera seems to capturing events as they happen. The 40 minute battle for the city that opens the film is shot in such away that one could believe it was ""real"". there is no music, only the battle for the city. The sequences of the rapes, of time with the comfort women and many of the atrocities and deaths are filmed as if we are there witnessing the terrible events, few cut aways, no swelling music for effect, just the horror before us. It is stark an indictment of not only the events that happened 70 years ago, but also an indictment of all wars. ""If you go to war these things will happen"" it seems to be saying with images that mirror recent conflicts. It is a message that can not be said enough.Forgive me its hard to describe this episodic film so that it will do it justice. Its told in connected parts that are separated by letters and post cards from inside the city. We follow several characters, the Chinese secretary of John Rabe, a German citizen trapped in the city who was in charge of the international zone which was turned into a ""safe haven"". We see his family and those around them.There is one of the women on the board of refugees. We follow Japanese Sargent who isn't happy with all that is going on around him. We see occasionally one of the comfort women the Sargent sees a couple of times. At the start follow a soldier fighting the Chinese, and his side kick a young boy. There are other flashes of characters who come and go and fill in the mosaic of the tale. Its not the entire story, or anyone persons story its the tale of the city and what happened.I liked that everyone is seen in various lights. We have a Japanese soldier with doubts to be sure, but he's not the only one. We see hesitation in many of the Japanese. This isn't to say they aren't bad, they are, but they are shown to be more than just monsters.It makes the horrors that transpire all that more troubling. And we see some less than brilliant moves on the part of some of the Chinese, moves that they hoped would work in their favor and instead ended up working against them.This is a deeply moving, deeply disturbing film. Its as anti-war as you can get. there is great horror, from the normal horrors of war, to numerous and frequent graphic rapes, nastiness involving children and pretty much every kind of cruelty you can think of. A sequence where the women in the international zone are brought into a church and told that one hundred of them must go with the Japanese to be comfort women is has harrowing as sequence in any film since the women know that they are going off to a fate worse then death. And yet there is weird kind of hope in the sequence (and in the film). By some women choosing to go they bought time for the other women. From death, life.The film is filled with many sequences where from death some life comes. From some darkness there is light. As bleak and hopeless as things appear, there is often some ray of hope among the darkness. Indeed as the film makes clear the war ended, the Japanese left and China and humanity survived. From death, life.Words of description are futile, just as any mention of the films flaws is.All I can say that really counts is see this film. See this and prepared to be moved."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"There is a harrowing slow-motion sequence in City of Life and Death which encapsulates the experience of this movie for me-- the shot of a few women in an attic looking up as they realize something dreadful is happening outside, followed by a Japanese soldier getting up to inspect his ""work"" under the open sky. In this movie, the audience is simply (and cruelly) asked to ""bear witness"" to a Conquest-in-progress-- without (the comfort of) being able to understand or do anything about it. And the basic nature of Conquest is, now as always, ""revelling on the ruins of your enemies' civilization"" (to paraphrase the director).So while the film is framed around the ""Safety Zone"" established (by John Rabe, Minnie Vautrin, etc.) for the first month or so during the conquest of Nanjing(Nanking) in World War II, the establishment & workings of the Safety Zone is hardly the focus of the movie. Which means, unfortunately for gore-hounds and hate-mongers, that the scope of the film is limited when it comes to events happening outside the Safety Zone, e.g. the head-chopping competition reported like a sports series in Japanese newspapers-- but perhaps the Japanese should be the ones making movies about their head-chopping champions.In other words, this is one of those art-house ""war movies"" (no, ""Schindler's List"" doesn't count-- try ""La Battaglia di Algeri"") which will probably disappoint all kinds of people from action-junkies to history-buffs. And as the movie is filmed in Japanese, English, German and a variety of Chinese dialects, not to mention Mandarin spoken with various accents, only ""speed-readers"" with an interest in art-house films should give it a try-- as most audiences will be reading/needing subtitles most of the time.This is because this movie is a self-declared memorial (from the film's opening titles) to the victims of Nanjing, 1937-- filled with broken bodies and minds, but also imbued with a life-loving spirit. It may be roughly divided into 3 sections which I will call (from the invaders' viewpoint) ""Shock and Awe"", ""Rest and Recreation"" and ""Mission Accomplished""-- or if you prefer, ""The Men"", ""The Women"" and ""The Future"". The movie proceeds chronologically, but there is no real narrative flow to speak of as the audience is put into the shoes of various characters who are not privy to the ""big picture"". There is also no real dramatic or character development to speak of, since most these characters are just trying to stay sane or alive. And in this way, the movie quietly rises above most genre films (including ""war movies"")-- because every single frame of it (down to the fictional ""end-credits"") is pure cinema.From the realistically ""mute"" sound-scape barely scored with any music-- coupled with the crystal-clear sounds of ""live"" shots and explosions... to the realistically ""smokey"" landscape adjusted to monochrome (it was filmed in full color)-- catching every grain of dust/dirt wandering in and out of focus. Every shot is a window into the blasted hell-scape of Nanking. And with very little opportunity for emoting and ""acting"", every single cameos (like the Caucasian roles-- would love to see a movie about Minnie Vautrin) are given unforgettably sharp and natural characterizations.The first half-hour or so of the film presents the invaders in ""Shock and Awe"" mode, as they systematically ""mop up"" all the resistance and the men in Nanjing-- giving the audience a chance to take a long, hard look at the faces of the refugees/ prisoners-of-war. However, the main bulk of the film shows the invaders in ""Rest and Recreation"" mode, having fun like the youths that they are-- even at the expense of the women in the Safety Zone. The film concludes with a short epilogue after the collapse of the Safety Zone, when the invaders take full control and celebrate their ""Mission Accomplished""-- but with a symbolic twist at the end shows who really had the last, bitter laugh.The fact that this film was released in Mainland China, which doesn't have a movie-rating system, may give some the impression that it was made for mainstream or ""general"" audiences-- but it's probably just that Chinese parents are expected to do a bit more ""homework"". So apart than sharing my feelings about this film, I would give potential audiences a word or two of advice:1) Watch the director Lu Chuan's earlier films like ""The Mountain Patrol"" first to get a taste of his film style/ language-- as his is a kind of neo-realism or cinema verite (completely different from the Danish Dogme films or ""Reality TV"") designed to immerse the audience in the film environment, rather than to convey any plot or character. To make the most out of a mountain of research, the director has simply chosen a few significant historical events (and created a few fictional ""composite"" characters for them)-- to make the audience ""live through"" the winter of 1937 in Nanking.2) Do a little research on what was happening in 1937, (as well as the Chinese Army's last stand in Shanghai, before they gave up China's then-capital Nanking), to get a historical perspective of what happened before and during the events in film-- with some basic historical background in mind, it will be easier to understand what is being conveyed by each shot or scene-- this film is not a substitute for historical research and the director certainly does not claim to have the last word on Nanjing....**SPOILERS**...P.S. If you didn't get all of the symbolism in the last scene-- one of them is ""Fatman and Little Boy""."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The fact that Japan invaded China during the late 1930's is often eclipsed by the subsequent outbreak of WW2 a couple of years later. What happened during that assault, and particularly what came to be called 'The Rape of Nanking' - China's then capital - was to set the benchmark for Oriental brutality during the Pacific conflicts to come. There has never been an adequate accounting.This movie is a much-belated and necessary piece of cinema, then. It is also of quite astonishing quality. A Chinese production with an estimated budget of just $12m, it is a tour-de-force. By all technical standards, it compares extremely favourably with the best of the genre from Hollywood or Europe. Commercial Chinese cinema, like much of Chinese production, is on a steep learning curve in order to catch up to the long-established traditions and skills of the Occident. I wasn't expecting much. It came out of the local supermarket bran-tub. Yet here is a long, intricate and extremely proficient work. One is obliged to make allowance for cultural nuances. Some of the scenes detailing relationships are needlessly maudlin for my (British) tastes, though not particularly worse than Hollywood schmaltz. It is yet far more mature and less melodramatic than the German production of 'Stalingrad'. Shot in B&W, like 'Schindler's List', it instead describes a national holocaust rather than a racial one, and is therefore less inclined towards the moral brow-beating of Spielberg's overlong Oscar junket.Almost all of the faces are unfamiliar (to me), and this lends the movie a genuine newsreel experience, like the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, or the Cambodian killing-fields. There's nothing to spoil here. This movie is about exactly what it says on the box - appalling demonic cruelty and mass-murder. It's a missing page of history. But it IS cinema; it's not a documentary. It's harrowing and disagreeable viewing. It's flawed, but it's also highly competent and professional. Easily a match for 'The Killing Fields' or 'Stalingrad', better than 'Enemy At The Gate', and only a step behind 'Schindler's List'.Chinese cinema has definitely come of age. Recommended. The 'High-Fliers' DVD has English subtitles."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The city is Nanjing, then capital of China. The time is 1937-38 when Japanese forces occupied the place. The story is the horrific consequence of that occupation for Chinese soldiers and civilians alike. The film is dedicated to the 300,000 victims of the atrocity, a figure that is still debated. The executions, the hangings, the beheadings, the burning, the bayoneting, the burying alive, the rapes - all of which happened - are all shown, but not overly dwelt upon. Instead young Lu Chuan, who both wrote and directed, tells a human story, focusing on a limited number of individuals, not all Chinese. This 2009 work was originally shot on colour film and then desaturated into black and white and the cinematography by Yu Cau is very impressive.We are offered politically correct depictions of the bravery of the Chinese soldiers and the nobility of Chinese civilians, especially the women, but the focus on the international safety zone brings to the fore the role of John Rabe, often called the German Schindler, and other nationals. Surprisingly, however, Lu gives an important role to a (fictional) young Japanese officer called Kadokawa who is shown as compassionate and horrified by what his fellow soldiers are doing - a characterisation that understandably proved controversial in China.When I was in Japan, where they talk of the 'Nanjing Incident', at the Memorial Museum in Hiroshima of all places I found that the Japanese are still downplaying the scale of this slaughter. When I was in China, where they call it the 'Nanjing Massacre', not least during my time in Nanjing itself the history was still live and feelings remain raw. I wish that this film could have been seen as much in Japan - which has still not faced up to its wartime crimes in the way that Germany has done - as in China and indeed Europeans and Americans should know more, as they would by viewing the film, about the rape of Nanjing."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"City of Life and Death is the sensational bringing to life of the Japanese's massacre, or ""rape"" as the film itself states in its promotional material, of the Chinese people based within the Chinese city of Nanjing; a besieging and brutal taking of an urbanised locale quickly reduced to rubble during the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 through to said conflict's complications and consequent merging with the Allied Pacific campaign of World War II. Chuan Lu's film doesn't just raise awareness, indeed put across historical events of which few may be aware of outside of The Far East nor indeed lecture on how terrible everything was whilst pining to a western ignorance; in actuality, the film rejects a style more synonymous with 2003's Imaging Argentina or 2007's Goodbye Bafana as films observing darker chapters in human rule, and instead confronts the issue in an engaging, grounded and cinematic manner.It's worth mentioned at this point that, despite the material, the film looks absolutely stunning; an instance much later on as a militarian Japanese big-wig looks on towards us, slightly off camera, as the stakes that bound those executed moments earlier stand idly behind him, a prisoner still tied to one, strikes us as an individual image worthy of a Pulitzer winning photographic portfolio. The film covers two principal characters, in the early stages Nanjing is yet to fall and we begin on the battlefield outside the city's limits as a young Japanese private named Kadokawa (Nakaizumi) awakens from passing out and sees the first images post-slumber to that of what we see of the film proper. The opening fight sequences between Chinese forces and Imperiast Japense Army troops carry with them highly primal; highly tribal and highly medieval-like characteristics; in that a breaching of a city wall is followed by either band of men standing at opposite ends of a road. They taunt and chant, waving whatever weapons they have, before one charges the other in a manner more resemblant to that of what large clusters of men centuries ago may have done when sword and shield were the instruments of war that they wielded.As the Japanese close in, pockets of resistance and live Chinese plague the area; the finding of a large cluster on them in a church bringing about the alerting to the proper authorities, whom pounce to the area wielding an air-raid siren which laboriously hums away in that way air-raid sirens do, as if a giant mosquito of some kind; swooping down and in ready to suck the life from those whose blood it is will shortly be spilt. In amidst all of this is a Chinese academic and translator whom works for a local German doing his best to save the Chinese through his place of business doubling up as a makeshift hospital-come-safety zone; the man is a certain Mr. Tang (Fan), a sort of Itzhak Stern to that of the German John Rabe (Paisley), who uses an uneasy alliance Germany supposedly has at this point with Japan to save and offer sanctuary. One of the more intricate exchanges is a sequence in which Rabe's Nazi armband-plus-emblem must be used disparagingly to try and convince a somewhat merciless Japanese official of his authenticity, and that he is indeed in league with the man's nation if it means a chance at saving lives.The plight of young Kadokawa represents a more moralised representation of the Japanese, at once a trooper there to follow orders; the engaging in shoot outs with pockets of Chinese snipers and resistance and the doing of his job gives way to a burning sense of wrongfulness within the operation. Kadokawa's presence and the generality of his strand offers an oppositional viewpoint from the perspective of what is effectively the enemy; content preventing the film from merely demonising the Japanese nor indeed constructing an anonymous, faceless, machine-like representation of them. Kadokawa's overlying detachment is highlighted during an exchange with a local Chinese prostitute, his inability to properly engage with her for means men essentially frequent her forces the woman into driving proceedings and stands in stark contrast to many-a other Japanese soldiers quite willingly able to commit war rape; a distinction alienating Kadokawa from his peers and suggesting at an alternate mindset, one that is not a rampaging, masked face of evil.Lu in no way holds back from some of the more sterner content one might expect, bloody wartime violence imbued throughout and barely giving way to anything else; the meticulous attention to the precise Japanese techniques used in liquidising and cleansing the city of those deemed the enemy shown at great lengths, the lengths to which Lu and his production team go in recreating sanctioned off spaces of dirt harbouring the Chinese prisoners penned in by wooded fences and wire quite frightening, as are the finer attentions to details: a long wooded bamboo cane used to cut a disparate pack of would-be inmates into separate clans consisting of those ready to be heaved off for execution and those whom must suffer some other means of fate particularly memorable. The sequences of death and mass destruction carry with them an eerie atmosphere of acceptance, a torch bearer making his way to a fuel drenched building full of prisoners seeing those nearer the boarded up exits wielding resigned looks on their faces. Lu's film hits all the right notes; it is a film that allows its characters to walk, alone, down bombed out and destroyed streets pondering a decision which will have great ramifications. It is a natural film, an honest film; a film willing to have a character confront his captain after having just witnessed him executed a prisoner and enquire as to whether it was necessary – those involved in its production deserve immense praise."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Everything about how this was filmed, shot, paced and the tone it hits was just perfect. Devastating at times and hard to watch but truly catches the trauma of the real life events as well as the lack of morality by most involved!"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Unlike Shindler's List or John Rabe, this film focuses not on one particular hero in this kind of atrocities, but the countless ordinary people suffering from the horrors of war. Director Lu did an excellently balanced view, some may say too balanced, from the civilians and the soldiers - Chinese and Japanese alike during the rape of Nanking. The subject matter is profound, the acting is top-notch, the cinematography is excellent, however, the pacing is deliberately slow to match the mood of the film, making me wonder some time how long I had to suffer through. The ending is also a disappointment, when the director tries way too hard to make life the symbol. Still, overall, the movie is good, important and relevant. Watch it."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"As a Historian and big Fan of War motion pictures, and seen quite many of them, I was really surprised of authenticity of this film. It is really based on historical facts (Please read: Iris Chang: The Rape of Nanking).The greatness of this film is also on its cast: using both Japanese and Chinese actors. Choice, which was not easy, even as is has been almost 75 years since Massacre of Nanjing happened. Surprising in this film was also lack of ""political message"". Film was done in China, but there was no hail of communist party, actually not even mentioned at all. Bravo China! All those things to put together, this movie is as powerful anti-war as anything can be. Something Mr. Spielberg should watch and compare to his Schindler's List. As a piece of film art, this Movie belongs to the Top 10 movies made this century.Highly Recommended! (+18 only!)"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"City Of Life And Death is the story of the Japanese ransacking of the Chinese city of Nanjing during WWII. Known as The Rape of Nanjing, the Japanese were responsible for the rape and torture of thousands of woman and children as well as the murder of an hundreds of thousands of Chinese.With a storyline such as this, a film will be a hard journey to go on. The film holds nothing back, it reveals the horror, brutality, panic and desperation that is war. Filmed in glorious black and white, the film looks incredible, this along with the recreation of a destroyed Nanjing, it is both meticulously made and brilliantly played out. There are a hand full of main characters and much of the film is seen from the point of view of the Japanese. Yet we also see what life was like for those inside the 'Safe Zone', a mix of Chinese and foreigners. The film is relentless with it's presentation of the horrors: Images of dead bodies scattered in the streets, innocent people shot at point blank range, woman and children rape and assaulted, bodiless heads hanging swaying in the wind. The images and confronting and upsetting. Then there are the scenes of the hundreds of men rounded up and murdered. Some were locked into a large shed and burnt alive, whilst others were simply shot. The image of hundreds of men standing at the shore of a lake, before the inevitable takes place is an image that greatly affected me. As did much of the film. I found it intensely and deeply moving, the idea that humanity can treat each other so very badly is brought home with a punch in this film. The fact that woman would 'volunteer' to be sex slaves to save others is remarkable and dreadful.Yet through all this horror, there are tiny hints that people tried to retain normailty, children played, women sung, even the Japanese are shown as humans, practicing the dance they latter perform with roaring drums and perfect choreography. The film ends with a note of hope, that some were able to escape the atrocities and perhaps go onto to lead something of a normal life. The film is an history lesson, telling a story that I knew nothing about. It's a hard story to take in, but an important one.more of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"As I've written over at the movie ""John Rabe"", this is the other side of the (same) coin. In this the main focus is not on Mr. Rabe though. He also is a bit different than in the other version. While he is almost like another version of ""Schindler"", here he does not have that aura surrounding him.Of course the truth might be somewhere in-between. What you have here, is not a focus on one person. And intriguingly enough, one of the characters we get to know is Japanese. All the madness that goes on, in wartime gets depicted here in a very powerful and almost unwatchable way at times. And while you had a main character to hold onto in John Rabe, you don't really have one here. It's more about the story of what happened, than a biography of one person, or what one person went through. So it does involve quite a few people, which might make it more powerful for you ... or less, depending on how you look at it.And as I've written on the other movie, I think the best thing to do, is watch ""Rabe"" and this one back to back, to get the most out of the story and also being able to compare them"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Plot: The Imperial Japanese capture the Chinese city of Naking in 1937 and proceed to go on an orgy of rape, murder and looting.Some films hit you in the gut. This is one of them. It's a mini epic, which means that it confines its story to a few blocks rather than the whole city, the budget permitting no more. We start of with the conquest of the city, which provides a few combat scenes for war movie junkies. Swiftly though we're onto the post-battle. First the Japanese slaughter the Chinese POWs. Then they begin looting. If women are found then they are raped. A safe area, under the protection of the Nazi John Rabe and a handful of Europeans, is set up. The Japanese don't want to upset the Europeans so they leave them alone at first until the temptation becomes too much. Then they do the same to the safe zone as they have done everywhere else.The story is told through both Chinese and (controversially in China) Japanese eyes. Occasionally it threatens to turn into melodrama and during the scenes of the POW slaughter the directer appears to lose control a little, overwhelmed perhaps by the size of the killings. For a good 90% of the film though this is an Asian ""Come and See"", as the full horrors of total (and racial) war are made clear. The film looks beautiful (especially the Church), the actors play their parts with dignity and compassion and the story is told with a measured care that only serves to make it the more powerful. Don't take your girlfriend but do watch it.P.S. The final shots are symbolic. Think atomic."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This very fine and artistic film is about the capture of Ninjang and the Massacre that followed, lots of lives were lost and it's a sad event of the Second Sino-Japanese War and in Chinese history. The filmmakers did an incredible job at making this movie as realistic as possible and they were successful with that. It's a must watch but a hard watch.The overall tone and atmosphere of the movie is grim and dark, it shows first in that it's very saturated and almost black & white, but then throughout the film we get to see the terrible and sad events play out. The movie is dark because of the story it needs to tell, an event in the Chinese history of a Massacre that killed 300,000 thousands of people. It has to be depressing, grim and dark.At the 2009 Asia Pacific Screen Awards, the film won Achievement in Directing and for Achievement in Cinematography. It won rightfully as the directing and cinematography was top notch. Visual masterpiece. Chuan Lu directed and wrote the movie, he's the man that made it the masterpiece it is along with everyone else who worked on the film. The camera work was fantastic, normally I don't really like the shaky camera movement but it fit this film completely because of how it feels like you're a soldier or a character that follows along on the adventure. The practical and visual effects were great, so were the special effects and makeup department. Costume and prop department were also great, the whole production was incredible.The musical score was phenomenal, nothing super dramatic but stressful and really emotional in some way and how they played with the natural sound when there were no music, just phenomenal.There is not a huge amount of dialogue in the first half of the movie and I had no problem with as its war, a tragic battle and massacre. But the second half is all about the aftermath which is just depressing to watch but the world needs to know of this battle and hearing about this film made me learn more about it.To end my review I want to talk about the acting, but first off, this is by far one of the most realistic war movies I have seen. In every aspect, and the acting is a huge factor in it. Their performances and portrayals feels so real I don't have to say anything else as they succeeded in bringing everything to their performance. There are a lot of great characters in this film, some probably were inspired by real people but they were realistic and well written."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"First, I'm a Chinese. But I think this film is only average in what 2 hrs can deliver. Maybe, I know too much before hand, and expecting more from it.For people who knows nothing about Nanjing massacre, I still recommend you to see this film. It is an introductory course, and leaves you some unanswered questions after watching it. To make a good film out of the Nanjing massacre is not difficult. There are lots of stories the director can use. But it just missed. I'd think another documentary ""Nan King"" is a bit better in terms of content. However, I must say a good thing about this movie is less violent than it can be. If you check out the videos in youtube, you will know.I'm not a overwhelming patriot, and never have been.I don't need the film to be portrayed from China perspective, so long as it stays with facts and balance view. The were goods & bads in Japanese soldiers, and so were Chinese. Spending too much time to show a Japanese soldier's remorse is a bit boring and out of proportion. He was only a minority. What's in the mind of the majority Japanese soldiers? This is not revealed. (Harmony is the current theme in China. Is this related?)Some of the plots are unnecessary, too much battle & gunfire...no need. Just like car chase in each standard action movies. Have seen enough of such which did much better. I'd rather to see each main character's individual story.For example, some of the Japanese women didn't know what job they were going to do in China when recruited from Japan homeland. They thought they could contribute something to their country , but their job were assigned as prostitutes. This could be a good plot, but just missed.Story of the film is a bit weak. The only touching moment is when recruiting 100 women for Japanese soldiers.If you are interested in this movie, I'd also recommend you to see ""Tokyo Trial""."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The film is a documentary-style retelling and visualisation of the events that made up the 'Rape of Nanking.' The city of Nanking was the Chinese capital in 1937, and was captured during the Sino-Japanese War by the Japanese. What followed was a well-observed series of atrocities committed by the conquerors against the native Chinese population. This movie looks predominantly at the fate that befell the refugees who gathered in an International Safe Zone, supposedly protected by international guarentees. The Japanese army systematically hunts down and murders Chinese army personnel, machine gunning or burning them alive - the imagery of such events is incredibly chilling and poignant. Then the occupiers start chipping away at the Zone, finally extracting women to become 'Comfort Women' for serial rape over three weeks by the Japanese army by threats. Nothing is portrayed too full frontal, but those who die on the job are slung onto carts without pity, thought or clothes! Yes, some of the images are extremely powerful and make 'Schindler's List' as a movie look more like a Teddy Bear's picnic ( not the subject matter, of course). Characters who are highlighted gradually succumb to death in one way or another in the randomised violence by those who have total power over others. One survives, care of one sympathetic Japanese soldier, who commits suicide for letting a boy go, and life is seen to go. Powerful and gripping - those who complain are just being pernickety. Because, of course it is only a partial view of what went on overall in Nanking in 1937 - let's face it we did not piles of emaciated bodies being buried with tractors in 'Schindler's List,' did we?"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is an important movie. It is a movie that shows the brutality of the Japanese army towards the Chinese people. It is an honest showing of how the Japanese raped, butchered and beat the people of Nanking. Nanking was not the only Asian city the Japanese brutalized people, they did it also in Korea and Vietnam. It is ashame that this movie will not get the recognition that it deserves. Why? Because it is about Chinese people being butchered. This film is the Chinese version of Schindler's List and it is deserving of recognition for it's subject matter. Interesting fact: not one single Japanese soldier/commander was ever hunted down and tried for these war crimes. That should have been just as important as hunting down the Germans for their war crimes. One race is not more important than another."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I could not talk for a long time when I went homeI never see a movie about the slaughter in Nanjing in 1937 like this.Lu Chuan puts away his hates,in this movie ,he don't want to talk about the Historical issues between Chinese and Japanese,he just want to talk about the Issue of Life and Death ,like this movie's Title--City of Life and Death .""Better dead than alive""Kadokawa said in this movie,so,he killed himself in the final.no one alive in that city in 1937.We can not Said on behalf of the victims to forgive,We can not forget history,either.I do not know what kind of emotions with the face of the history of Sino-Japanese,but I know War is the most detestable thing in the world."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Having just recently subjected myself to the almost documentary-like horrors of the Russian film COME AND SEE (about as sobering an experience as can be had), I opted to push my luck and try CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH. I've seen a number of documentaries regarding Japan's invasion of China, so I knew what to expect (although I DIDN'T expect the opening scenes, which harked back to the gritty, hand-held carnage of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). In fact, CITY OF LIFE AND DEATH is actually more than a little forgiving in some of its depictions: characters who may or may not have been as sympathetic to the ""lesser beings"" are given the benefit of the doubt (no doubt by way of presenting a more ""balanced"" view of rape and wholesale slaughter). (Note: in one documentary I saw, a recaptured prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp was hung for all to see and a note was pinned to his chest: ""I'm back,"" it read. And you thought the Nazis had no sense of humor...)"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I should give it a 7 for the quality. This film made me cry, I gave it a 10 for its emotional impact. Unlike the holocaust films, there are not many films about the Japanese invasion of China. I want to raise its rating so more people will watch it. That is another reason I gave it a 10.It has quite a few clichés. The scene which the Japanese soldiers pulled down China's National Father's Sun Yat-sen status was exactly a copy what happened when the USA soldiers did to saddam hussein's statue in Iraq. Was there really a statue like this in the city at that time? Some of the scenes are predictable. When someone dies, the actors will cry, when someone is shot, everyone will panic, etc. In the end, the heroes were shot. Was it necessary to make this film in black and white, that just seems to me that they copied it from Schindler's list.It is about the city of nanjing, but it did not show many scenes in nanjing. It is understandable that it is hard to shoot scenes in the modern city of nanjing. however, they can still try to do some CGI. The buildings all look too western. None of the quintessential nanjing buildings was shown in the film, so it seemed that this could have happened in any city around the world. It didn't have the nanjing flavor. It is a known fact that the Japanese soldier also invaded the grandiose Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. They could have shot some powerful scenes at the Mausoleum.This film is too long. indubitably, this is not an easy story to tell in such a short time. The beginning of the film was not much related to the rest of the film. And for people who are not familiar with the invasion of China's capital city, it might take a while for them to understand this film. And where do those postcards come from? It is easier for audiences to watch and to hear than to read random postal cards.It is a good film, but I don't think that it will be a classic to represent what happened in the city of nanjing at that time."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"City of LIfe and Death is a Chinese drama about the Nanking Massacre when the Imperial Japanese Army tortured, captured and assassinated around three hundred thousand residents. The movie has a few unusual elements. It is shot in black and white which evokes the cinematography of the year when the movie actually takes place. The film focuses on strong images instead of commentary, dialogues and plot lines. The final result looks at times like a documentary rather than a drama which is quite unusual and takes some time to get used to in the first quarter.Once the audience is used to these unusual but intriguing artistic choices, several parallel stories evolve of which four manage to stand out from start to finish. First of all, we follow a Chinese soldier named Shunzi who fights the Japanese opponents in a last ditch effort but gets captured and is soon left for dead. Shunzi and an orphan boy are the lone survivors of a massacre and make it to a safety zone where they continue to fight for survival on a daily base. Secondly, the film follows Tang, the secretary of an influential German businessman who manages the daily operations in the safety zone. When the German businessman is forced to leave the city, Tang must decide whether he saves his own life or stays behind to protect the entire community. Thirdly, the movie portrays Japanese officer Second Lieutenant Ida who establishes a reign of terror. He develops multiple methods for assassinating civilians, forces foreign women into prostitution and frequently organizes brutal raids to intimidate locals but also to earn respect of his own soldiers. Fourthly and lastly, the viewers meet naive Superior Private Kadokawa who has difficulties coping with the horrors of war and his feelings of remorse. The gentle young man falls in love with a Japanese prostitute and dreams of returning home and marrying her but his idealistic dreams are brutally shattered and worsen his fragile psychological condition.The movie follows the stories of these intriguing characters and their associates, families, friends and foes calmly, objectively and observantly. They intertwine on numerous occasions leading to crucial twists and turns. With each minute that passes by, the characters gain depth and often end up making gripping controversial choices. The viewers end up asking themselves how they would react under such grisly circumstances. Some stories end in worst case scenarios while others inspire hope, lust for life and resilience. The movie is balanced and avoids traps such as pointing fingers or promoting patriotism which is something most war movies fail to accomplish. Considering the delicate topic matter, the movie manages to remain diplomatic without offending any party involved. Just like the movie The Pianist, this film shows that there are good and bad people on either side even though cold hard historical facts are never blurred as in movies such as Life Is Beautiful.City of Life and Death ranks among the most balanced, creative and detailed war movies ever and deserves much attention and praise. Anyone who is interesting in history of the twentieth century should watch this film. The first thirty minutes are somewhat unusual due to the courageous artistic choices but the film grows with every minute and ends up being educational, inspiring and moving all at once."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The battle scene in this movie I'm sure is already regarded as a classic. Nothing is done on the cheap. The locations and sets are so authentic one quickly forms an emotional picture of life under tyranny. The director has an uncanny knack for silhouette, use of simple drums, the use of gunfire as a means of shock, of the menace of an almost deserted street, the seeming absurdity of a bicycle, the use of vivid images such as flags or dead animals. The director also brings out the very real horror of any situation through close-ups of actors in frozen reaction and by following their eye-line. I docked the piece a point for being overly ponderous and a little contradictory toward the end. The audience easily acquires the tragedy. Some of the latter scenes could have been shorter. That's my only criticism. Mind you, the effective use of black and white was also controversial to me. I would have liked to have seen it in colour.The gravity and expertise of this movie is similar to Schindler's List and The Grey Zone, and if those are favourites, then with Nanjing! Nanjing! you are about be well and truly favoured once again."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Although I am always angry on the historical crimes done by Japanese soldiers on Nanjing citizens, I felt not so impressive but calm by this film unlike many others who were totally shocked by the it. What can help me understand the purpose of this film is the title in English - City of Life and Death, which Chuan want to emphasize in his film. The end of the film also highlighted this key point by the suicide of Kadokawa with a question of life or death. Another choice on this question is demonstrated in the film is from Mr. Tang. He left his pregnant wife alone and choose to stay in Nanjing. He choose death because he gave another people the life. And his life will be prolonged by his second child to be born. So every scenario in the film is a choice. Actually many of them are not real choice. At that situation, you have no choice under the weapon of inhuman troops."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Stark, perfectly charted with a documentary approach in black and white,this brilliantly composed cinematic retelling of the 1937 invasion and destruction of the city of Nanking by the Japanese is grim, indeed. It deals with the complete subjugation of a largely innocent populace, including the brutal rapes of hundreds with ensuing venereal disease and death. The film is not simply a series of unrelated scenes of rampant sadism, but is linked together by focusing on four or five different characters from several sides of the conflict, thus involving the viewer and making us care about individuals. This is not an entertainment, but a lesson; from my viewpoint, however, it was never dull and it was convincing in its power, a power imposed by thoughtful film-making"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Sometimes I wonder if such subjects as the brutal occupation of Nanking are fit to be depicted on screen in a dramatic fashion due to the sheer horror of the events depicted. It leaves me feeling uncomfortable thinking that perhaps the true (and only) medium for such events are factual documentaries with first person contributions from survivors/perpetrators (In the UK, Laurence Rees' BBC work on the Nazis).The film begins with the first Act/sequence on the last remnants of Chinese resistance to the Japanese, the Chinese soldiers betrayed by their own officers/commander fleeing, leaving them to be crushed in their desperation to flee. Chinese POWs are then shown no mercy as they are executed in various horrific ways.The second Act moves on to more personal dramas involving Kadokawa, the Japanese soldier with a conscience and Church education; the Tang family including Mr Tang, long-term factotum to John Rabe, the Nazi representative in Nanking, his wife and her sister; Miss Jiang, a school-teacher. Here, the Japanese soldiers begin to brutalise women and the International Zone proves to offer little protection as the women are raped and then forced to become 'comfort women'. As Piers Brendon says in the Dark Valley, the Japanese military sanctioned systematic abuse of women through prostitution: the most chilling scene for me in the film was that of Japanese soldiers wheeling a barrow full of female corpses, murdered by constant abuse, whilst their comrades stand around joking with each other.I thought Mr Tang, a fascinating character(if controversial), in how he is forced to collaborate with the Japanese in an effort to save his family but that this proves to have tragic consequences. His attempts to learn Japanese words such as 'friend' prove pathetic as he is indeed forced to become their 'friend' as he informs on injured Chinese soldiers in the InternationalZone to buy himself time, but Tang makes a terrible error in thinking that he can reason/bargain with the devil.Isaiah Berlin, the philosopher, raised similar questions about moral complexity/compromise. Do we judge Tang as a weak man? How can we judge him when we, ourselves, have never faced such a terrible situation? The third sequence concerns the Tangs and their escape, as Tang finds a sense of redemption and personal defiance against his nemesis, the brutal,unpredictable junior officer, Ida; and Kadokawa & his 'act of mercy' towards Miss Jiang.The title of the film itself is often alluded to. Death is often preferably to life when a situation is abhorrent (rape, the loss of one's mind). A Japanese soldier cynically tells Mr Tang that 'life is good' as he deliberates upon his chance of escape with Rabe & his wife. At the end, Kadokawa allows a Chinese boy soldier and his adult companion to escape and to live.Although it was a touching moment allowing a brutal film to end on a note of hope, I felt it sanitised, from a modern 21st perspective, the indefensible, and the truth of the events surrounding Nanking. Similarly, criticism has been mounted at 'Downfall', about the last days of Hitler in his bunker, and the portrayal of Albert Speer, as a heroic figure saving Germany's infrastructure despite the Nero Order. Again, the film hides the truth and how Speer used a vast slave army to keep the German war machine going.Films depict, rarely do they scrutinise."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"There are so many horrors that people inflict upon the other, lesser, people in this world. Of course, to be able to do those atrocious things, you have to somehow dehumanize them or make them less then yourself. And it seems to work for so many inhabitants of this maddening planet. Average, exhausted person tries to block out all the things that don't fit their small, petty existence. We do not know which countries our leaders bombed in last 20 years. That doesn't make us participants in war crimes, but in the same time not every German or Japanese committed the atrocities on Jews or Chinese. They just averted their gaze from the disturbing or unpleasant. Without the passive onlookers, the monsters would be hiding in the sewers where they belong. Alas, courage is a rare commodity and heroes first scapegoats here and everywhere else ."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is a remarkable film. Shot entirely in black and white it has the feel of newsreel footage in some parts. Nanking is a dreadful testimony to the excesses and cruelties of war and one that Japan has not been fast to acknowledge. However this film goes beyond simplicities and goes beyond the particularity of this city's torment and destruction.War blights victor and victim alike. The story is told through the eyes and feelings of a few characters, that at the end you feel you knew, somehow, somewhere. There are some moments of stunning originality and unpredictability. The acting is convincing even if sometimes it feels almost balletic in the way scenes are played out.Perhaps the budget was low because the scenes feel like they were largely shot in a studio - but somehow that does not matter - just as the best of stage plays can be entirely convincing, so is this film. It absorbs, horrifies and moves. Not a film to be missed but perhaps not a film for the faint hearted either."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I rented this movie due to the high level of acclaim it received. However, for the first 20 minutes or so, I didn't know what I had gotten myself into. It was slow and boring, with some fighting going on, and little explanation. After those 20 minutes, the film got very interesting, and of course, very sad. I'm not an expert on what happened in Nanking, but I knew enough to know what to expect from this movie. Others have compared this to Schindler's List, and the fact that both films were shot in black and white to cut down on the graphic-ness and gore is a definite similarity between the two. For me Schindler's List is one of the five best movies I've ever seen, and while I wouldn't put ""City of Life and Death"" in that category, it's a sad but powerful film that won't disappoint."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"The film looks fine - it has decent cinematography and period detail - but it completely lacks any interesting characterisations or subtlety of plot. All we get is relenting grimness. Of course, that is to be expected in a film on this subject, but the grimness should be seen through the eyes of some characters we can identify with. Part of the film is from the point of view of a reluctant Japanese soldier which could've been interesting, but the idea is not developed and we just see more of the horror that the Chinese endured. The film seems to me to be a good illustration of the Hollywoodisation of world cinema. Instead of any interesting stories, ideas, or characters, we get pseudo-artsy photography, slow-motion sequences, sombre syrupy music, and over-emoting actors."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I expected a lot of this movie, considering it is a important part of Chinese history. Still, somehow the result was unconvincing.The Rape of Nanjing represents one of the worst war episodes both in Chinese and human history. The tension between China and Japan are still present today, since Tokyo remains reluctant to admit it's full responsibility for the crimes committed. Instead of a history based drama, ""Nanjing Nanjing"" seems like an expensive theatrical flamboyant TV play with an unfinished scenario. Furthermore, Japanese soldiers were depicted as almost friendly characters, which by all means is offensive to the victims of the crimes. Imagine a Holocaust themed movie with sympathetic SS officers... It just doesn't fit. The monochrome effect didn't help either. It looks fake and mostly unconvincing. I don't think the movie is terrible, yet I expected a lot more from a Chinese director on this matter. Before ""Nanjing Nanjing"" even hit the box offices, a big polemic was lead in the high party circles about the way Japanese army was depicted. Some officials even wanted to censor the movie and ban it from showing. I'm not a supporter of censorship, yet maybe in this case I could find understanding for such a decision.I guess Bertolucci has done a far better job with ""The Last Emperor"" in telling a Chinese story than Chuan."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"""City of Life and Death"" is one of the most powerful cinema experiences to depict both courageous and barbaric acts of humanity you may ever witness. Whether regarded as factual or fictionalised, this films weighs heavily and emotionally on the audience without obligation. Released in black and white, in documentary type reflection, Lu Chuan's film delineates the 1937 Japanese occupation of, then, China's capital Naking. Knowing full well that they were breaking international conventions of war, they disguised the massacre from the rest of the world.With severity, ""City of Lfe and death"" is portrayed from both a Chinese and Japanese perceptive from witnesses and testimonies gathered at the time. Alloted among hundreds of testimonial soldiers and civilians, a handful of characters proclaim the principal story. Significantly, German national John Rabe, his assistant Mr. Tang, a naïve Japanese officer named Kadokawa and various woman caught in the midst of the massacre. Prominemnely, Miss Jiang and Chinese prostitute Xiaojiang. The faculties of cruelty are manifested in ambitious scenes of either battle, civilians fleeing the fallen city and orchestrations of horrific war crimes. Most notable the massacre of Chinese Prisinors of War being machine gunned to death, buried alive, set on fire or marched into the sea. Yet, efficacious as these scenes are, the films most powerful presence is focused on the for-mentioned handful of characters who fought and died in this imposing space of urban devastation. Conspicousasly, the emotions of bravery are portrayed in these characters individually. The spirited actions of Nazi Rabe, the suicidal motivations of Mr Tang and Miss Jiang. Also, not forgetting the sacrificial act from Xiaojiang. Most notable, from my viewing perspective, is the scene where a captured Chinese solider covers a little Chinese boys eyes with his hand to blind him from his impending death. This scene is one of the most tending images I have ever witnessed on screen. Environing these scenes, the director acutely puts the atrocities on-screen without warning and without insightful rationale to understand the motivations of barbarism. In this review, I have decided not to detail these acts of humanity. After reading this review I mention favourably for the reviewer to witness this remarkable film. ""City of Life and Death"" easily achieves a convincible spectacle of mass atrocity and a magnitude of slaughter."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is an excellent movie for those of us who are not familiar with this historical event that took place in 1937 in Japanese occupied city of Nanking, China. It shows these war crimes as brutally as it can to help us understand the magnitude of terror and violence that was caused by the Japanese. It is raw, it is graphic, it is heart-wrenching and is difficult to watch at times. It shows the real ugly side of war and reminds you that humanity always loses in wars. It reminds us that whoever we are, we all have the blood of our ancestors who either committed these crimes or affected by them.A movie about Nanking Massacre; also known as, Rape of Nanking."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is a very brave movie, considering the history behind it. It takes guts to portray some of the Japanese as ""human"" (apparently something that caused so much outrage in China, the director even received death threats).The movie itself manages to walk the fine line of not really taking sides. It basically just walks us through the historic events and atrocities that take place in Nanjing. It makes you wonder what many of the Japanese soldiers involved back then must have felt during that time.I was a bit surprised the strict Chinese censorship passed the movie almost uncut (apparently only a scene of a beheading of a prisoner, a woman being tied up prior to her rape and an interrogation scene was cut). Maybe that's because we see the Kuomintang, not the Communist troops and so the portrayal of the poor discipline and morale was allowed to pass.All in all, this is one of the strongest anti-war movie from Asia I saw in a while. Not quite up there with ""Brotherhood"" (although both are different films), but definitely a good movie."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I am a dedicated fan of good war films, and have a substantial proportion of the greats in my own personal collection; so it is with some experience of the genre that I say that Chuan Lu's film is an absolutely outstanding cinematic masterpiece. This is an awesome achievement which stands head and shoulders above so much of the competition. Brilliantly written, brilliantly directed, topical and yet also historically authentic, it brings some fantastic talent to the screen who all give uniformly superb performances. The film is shot in black and white, which gives it a gritty, unsparing authenticity, and the cinematography is masterful and evocative. Every shot looks like a period photograph. The battle scenes are realistic, well choreographed, and technically accurate. And the music is haunting, contributing to the film at every level, and building to a heartbreaking climax. This is without doubt one of the best films I have ever seen, but it is also not for the faint of heart. The sheer squalor, horror, brutality and inhumanity of war is not shied away from, nor is the audience ever spared. Expect to come away from watching it emotionally drained."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is one of the most compelling, horrific, thought provoking and shocking movies I have ever seen. It is doubtful that even a documentary could show the horrors of war so succinctly and clearly, as presented in this movie. The characters humanity and in some cases, in-humanity are vividly drawn, adding to the realism and the nightmarish atmosphere, where just like in a nightmare, there seems to be no escape. The cinematography is amazing, and the contrast by transposing the violence of man over the beauty of nature (with the sound of a gentle breeze) is so very effective. I'd read about the ""Rape of Nanking"" a long time before, and started watching this movie half expecting it to be so depressing, to get only halfway through before switching it off. Wrong. It was gripping from the start and introduced characters I wanted to survive no matter what, and to characters I hoped would die - violently. The movie had such an impact on me that by the end of it, I'm ashamed to say, I was wishing they had dropped a lot more than two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War 2 in the Pacific. Don't get the wrong idea, this is not an anti-Japanese film, more an exposition of what the human animal can do at its worst - in this case the Japanese in 1937. I know that many other atrocities have been committed by other nations since, and unfortunately, will be in the future. To plagarise from another reviewer - we should forgive but not forget."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"One of the best war films I ever seen. Being a Chinese film is amazingly balanced. Its very difficult to maintain neutrality confronted with such a savage and cruel event. Nanjing! Nanjing! is absorbing and the black and white photography is superb. During the film you can watch how the inner forces of each character unfold. Some bring the evil within some the love and compassion within. War bring up the worst and the best of people. As Psychologist Phillip Zimbardo states; everybody has the potential to be evil given the right conditions. The film encourages us deeply to value life. As one of the Japanese characters says in the movie: ""Life is more difficult than death."""
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is a sweeping, often epic film in black and white, which imposes an old-school sobriety that works for this subject. Certainly, for anyone who really cares about film making, it is a must see. It's all the more impressive when you consider what hoops a Chinese director had to jump through to get it made. Much of it is truly horrifying and it is certainly NOT a film everyone should watch - yet from what I know of the actual events, it still does not portray the worst. Probably the most striking thing, especially coming from a Chinese filmmaker, is the attempt to really show people as people on both sides., which is mainly successful despite some of the horrors committed on one side. At some points - ironically the most horrifying - it actually attains a kind of poetry. If you don't know this history you may want to wait to read it until after you've seen the film - I sometimes found my mind wandering to things I'd read. It arguably is a TAD long, but overall beautifully acted and shot. But again, certainly not for everyone."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"As painful as it may be,this movie is perhaps the most devastatingly harrowing portrayal of the Nanking massacre on screen.There have been questions regarding its historical accuracy but of all the movies based on this harrowing topic - ""The flowers of war"", ""Don't cry, Nanking!"" and ""Man behind the sun"", this one touches the most and leaves you spellbound..The atrocities of the incident displayed on screen are shocking and gut wrenching but the finesse with which the battles,rapes, decapitation, mass shootings and burnings as well are choreographed demands appreciation.The dramatic elements are commandingly presented and you cannot but feel and empathize for the victims of the war.The first half is crafted well with battle scenes while the atrocities by the Japanese soldiers is reserved for the second half.The film masterfully depicts the endurance and bravery of Chinese soldiers and prisoners of war and shows how the ruthless acts of the Japanese soldiers fails to deter the spirits of the Chinese people.All the characters in the movie, right from Ye Liu as Lu Jianxiong ,the little boy who survives in the end, Mr Tang,John Rabe,Miss Jiang or Kadokawa give tremendous performances and portray deep emotion.Judging it as a pure cinema purist, this movie is grand and powerful in all respects and the attention to detail is eye-grabbing.An outstanding piece of cinema..highly recommended!"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I saw City of Life and Death while I was on a trip to Beijing, China. I have read Iris Chang's book and consider myself pretty familiar with the issue here. Obviously, this movie deals with a sensitive subject to both China and Japan. It was highly prompted by official CCTV and local newspapers in Beijing. I saw group of organized school children in my theater. Cornsidering the violent level of the movie, that surprised me a lot. China should consider a rating system similar to the west.Back to the movie, the director was trying to make a epic using a small budget.That shows on the screen. The city comprised of only one street, one refugee camp and one church. Thus the setting is hardly qualified as a city. The cinematography is the relatively bright spot in the movie, though hardly original.The director keeps pounding the audience using heavy images to the level I think is overdone. Several years ago,Jiang wen, a famous Chinese director, used similar visual style in his Cannes award-winning movie ""The devils at the doorsteps"" in a much effective way. I guess that's one reason Gilles Jacob ignored Nanjing Nanjing in this year's selection. I have to point out the ritual dance by the Japanese army looks bizarre to me. I have never seen such things in Japan myself. I talked to my Japanese friends about it. They all laughed at such idea. I'm afraid missed details like this will hardly bridge the cultural gaps of the two nations.If you are interested in the subject, Go get Jiang Wen 's ""The devils at the doorsteps""."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Just finished watching this with my husband--he likes war films but has no interest in Chinese culture--I am just the opposite, and will rarely watch a war film but am obsessed with China. We watched ""John Rabe"" a couple of days ago, and wanted to see the comparison viewpoints.OK, this is my personal opinion only, but I feel that, in spite of the good intentions and honesty of the film, it wandered...there was not really a clear plot and sections were so slow I had to keep my husband from falling asleep--and this is a guy who LOVES war films. The initial scene of the Japanese taking out the guerrilla soldiers in the church is played out excruciatingly, guns popping, little background music, some confusion as to who is who. I kept wondering when the STORY was going to begin. When, about 40 minutes in, we get to meet a few other characters it is a vast relief! We saw this on Netflix and you should know that the subtitles are about 4-5 seconds behind the actual speeches--I speak some Mandarin, but no Japanese, and was constantly irritated at the uncoordinated subtitling. Also, I wanted to see the connections between the characters made more clear; perhaps a title showing where some of the action was taking place would also have been helpful: ""Jinling Women's College"",""Red-Cross hospital"",whatever. I also must say that the John Rabe character seemed sort of wussy and did not at all show the kind of strength he actually exhibited (I have read several books on the Nanjing Massacre, Rabe's diary and how others saw him); Minnie Vautrin, who protected so many women and children at Jinling Women's College and personally stood up to Fukuda over the taking of their husbands/sons, etc. was merely a loud-mouthed white woman who seemed in the way at times--in real life,the Chinese women under her care called her the Goddess of Mercy! The role she should have had in the movie was taken by a fictive character called Miss Jiang, probably based on her assistant Mrs. Tsen.Anyone knowing anything at all about the Rape of Nanjing will wonder about the violence in the movie--this is not a gore-fest or a movie where the violence is displayed as a fetish, like in so many modern movies, but yes, it IS realistic, so be prepared. The director does not spare you in showing the atrocities, but the view of them is not drawn out unbearably and the detail is somewhat muted: no brains flying out, no close-ups of splattered heads, but you do see the lengths the Japanese went to, really, similar to an 'ethnic cleansing', and there is one rape scene that is pretty disturbing, but you don't really see much- -it's the emotional impact that gets you. There are also plenty of scenes dealing with the 'comfort women' that the officers insisted on, and, though a few of them were prostitutes already, most were simply women that were chosen for their looks and grabbed unwillingly. There is also a lot of callous violence against the Chinese citizenry that is simply excessive, even for a war.Another mention for those who are, like myself, for whatever reason, China-lovers: one of the main characters is a young Japanese soldier who is seen in an almost sympathetic light, as opposed to the majority of them, who do what they do with pleasure and seem to have no human connection at all, not even to the dazed 'comfort women' they literally rape to death. Mr. Tang, who is a fictive figure representing the Chinese assistant to John Rabe, is another character who does what he can to protect his family, but you may not like how he works, and certainly his karma catches up with him pretty quickly. I understand that the director was trying to see things fairly: not all Japanese soldiers were monsters, not all Chinese were saintly martyrs, but I do think too much time was spent on the 'nice' Japanese soldier. The Westerners in the film needed more development, especially considering they role they played in setting up the Safety Zone and protecting so many Chinese--they seemed superfluous and rather powerless in this movie, and that was unfortunate. Yes, it's a Chinese film, but in purporting to give a truthful presentation of facts, fair is fair and Rabe, Minnie Vautrin, Dr. Robert Wilson and Lewis Smythe were minimized to almost nothing here.The film is slow at times, meandering, has confusing moments and, I think, assumes the viewer is familiar with the history of the era. I believe it needed more dramatic flow, a tighter script, and perhaps more detailed characterizations of the main people; a lot of film footage could have been used better than those first tedious 40-minutes of ""battle"" time. It is a disturbing film that does show some of the atrocities, but does not go overboard--it is a movie that can be used for enlightenment as well as entertainment of a sort. I still believe a serious viewer needs to do some reading on this subject before they watch, in order to have a sense of what is really going on. Sometimes Chinese movies can be a little maudlin and over-dramatic (though I generally enjoy this!), but there is a good balance in the emotional scenes, and only one towards the end that may be a little much for some people. I did love the Chinese soldiers, just before death, shouting Long Live China!, and there is, even in this intense war film, moments of hope that linger in the heart. I recommend this film to anyone who loves China, who is interested in war, who wants to know some of the real story, who loves intense and honest film-making."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Depicting real events, this is an often difficult film to watch. However, it is also the type of film where you don't hit the pause button as you want to know what happens.The Director takes the viewer through a difficult journey, linking each scene effortlessly, and gets the best out of a large cast. Whilst this shows the events in Nanjing in 1938, it could also be telling the story of the horror and dehumanising effect of any war.Shot in monochrome it also presents, on one level the issues in black and white terms, that is, most Chinese good, most Japanese bad. However, at a more complex level the issues are simply not straightforward. It raises questions of when duty must override compassion, and when compassion must override duty. It raises issues about collaboration and integrity, love and sacrifice, and competing belief systems.I have no doubt that similar films could be made about the events at Srebenica in 1995, although the horror of Nanjing was on an almost unprecedented scale. The lessons are there to be learned, and the tragedy of all ages is that our politicians never learn them.I urge you to watch this film and tell others about it."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is very brave film making. It's shot in black and white and pulls absolutely no punches. It is told without prejudice and just tells the history as it sees it. Part of what makes this film so interesting is that in the main there is little narrative (although this begins to change to some extent I'm the second half of the film), it's mainly a series of events and whilst that adds to the realism it means that maybe we (certainly in my case) are not vested as much as we could be in individuals and their stories. Overall though this tells and important piece of history and is superbly made."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"There are a rare few films that have found a way to tackle some of the greatest atrocities ever committed by and upon the human race with such searing, unflinching emotional honesty that they move beyond the categorisations of drama or war movie to something that can best be described as bearing witness. Come And See and Schindler's List belong to this exclusive group, and so too now must Lu Chuan's extraordinary and harrowing City Of Life And Death.It is 1937 in Nanking, former Chinese capital and scene of what is about to unfold as one of the greatest war-crimes in history (a massacre verging on genocide and an event which continues to sour Sino-Japanese relations to this day), but writer/director Lu Chuan is not here to analyse wider military events or stratagems. We open with the briefest glimpse of the Japanese assault on the city walls, and then before the credits have even finished rolling his camera is already patrolling the post-conflict city streets; a blasted, ruined landscape. His film picks up where the likes of The Pianist or Saving Private Ryan leave off, in the midst of a destroyed world, with the invaders and the surviving remnants of the defeated population already pitched together in a dangerous and disorientating mix of sporadic resistance battles, vast wretched prisoner encampments and perilously tenuous civilian ""safety"" zones.Events are told in a masterful inter-cutting of macro and micro drama. We are introduced to only a handful of identifiable characters. Amongst them a Chinese bureaucrat trying to use his position to save his family, a young boy caught up in the resistance fighting, a naive prostitute (euphemistically referred to as comfort girls), one of thousands shipped to the front-line with no idea of the horrors awaiting them, and a single Japanese soldier with some semblance of conscience amongst his savage comrades. Their desperate personal stories intertwine inside the maelstrom of chaos and horror surrounding them.The stunning black-and-white photography veers from stark, hand-held and up-close, to vast and impressionistic sweeps that depict the large-scale massacres as nightmarish visions of some biblical apocalypse. The combined effect renders the feel of the movie as both something close to a rediscovered contemporary document and personal witness testimony, the small-scale drama illuminating the large-scale atrocity that might be beyond comprehension otherwise.At times heart-stopping in its intensity and tragic almost beyond expressing. City Of Life And Death is a profoundly moving depiction of inhumanity at its most grievous. It simply should be seen."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Astounding film. I'm still haunted by the masterful way the unblinking atrocities and the study of the human condition exist side by side in this film. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who can make their way through the horror,there's much to take away from this film. Each character followed in this story fills a purpose. The opening is the actual occupation of Nanking, and it's just as unrelenting as Saving Private Ryan's D-Day sequence. Little dialogue, just war. The rest of the film chronicles the atrocities as it focuses on individuals. There are scenes in this film that I will take with me forever, like the best of films give you."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I watched this movie in 2012 on BBC2 I think. I remember just turning it on when the initial battle was under way. I was utterly horrified by it's brutality and realism, perhaps made all the more so because I was ill at the time. Like the Russian movie 'Come and See' it projected me into a world I didn't really want to know about, but felt helplessly drawn into. This movie is brilliant for what it achieves. But it is not entertaining. It's the ultimate horror movie. It's a lesson about life and death. The title is completely apt.The event in question is the Japanese capture of the then capital of China, Nanking, shortly before WWII proper started. Historians refer to it as the Rape of Nanking because after it's capture, not only was there widespread rape, but 200,000 Chinese civilians were murdered in brutal ways. It was so bad that even the Nazis offered to intervene to negotiate an end to the brutality.There is a historical book about the event by a US author Iris Chang who spent many years researching the event. It's not at all surprising that one day she drove off a road and shot herself."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I'm usually more of a browser than a poster on this board, but after watching this film I want to share a couple of thoughts about it.The powerful images. I will never forget them. Two scenes in particular. First is the scene where the captured soldiers were led to the execution field, and just before getting swept by machine guns the soldiers shouted ""Long live China"" and ""China will not die"". At that moment rush of emotions overcame me, and I almost burst into tears. These were soldiers who fought and resisted until the very end, and at their last breath although they stood weaponless against the enemy, they resisted with their words.For this, I salute them with all my heart for their bravery, relentlessness, and the love of the motherland.The second unforgettable scene is the wide angle shot of the countless dead bodies which filled the entire beach. These people were fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, ordinary people, just like you and me. Yet they were mercilessly treated like dirt, or grains of sand, which are brushed aside and disposed of, simply to satisfy the egos of some high officers in the Japanese Imperial Army.If there is a lesson to be learned about this film, it is that throughout history, whether between nation states or between human beings, the strong will in most cases take advantage of the weak, and the weak will always be in the mercy of the strong. There is a Chinese adage, ""自强不息"", meaning ""to strengthen oneself ceaselessly"", which serves to remind us that To prevent oneself from being taken advantage of, one needs to strengthen himself.Thank you Lu Chuan for making this thought-provoking film.To the 300,000 some souls lost, may they RIP."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"It's VERY VERY VERY rare to see a Chinese movie about anti-Japanese invasion made so powerful and calm, well there are many solely powerful ones but powerful combined with calm is so rare.One thing that makes it so calm is the directer has some different ideas and messages to offer to the audience, namely, Japanese soldiers are not all bad; some of them feel bad for the war; we Chinese shouldn't just vent and pin the blame on everyone of them. Well truthfully these are great ideas and we should bear these ideas in mind, however, over 60 years have passed since Japan surrendered, the agony and hatred have not yet faded at all.So I guess it's safe to say that for Chinese people to appreciate this movie is yet too early.But Luchuan's effort is certainly seen and felt. I think a question movie makers need to think about is how to strike a balance between providing a powerful vent for the audience of China and giving them a chance to delve into the subject more deeply. Is it possible? I think yes.Think about this, if the movie didn't give that many minutes to the part about the Japanese soldier and the Japanese prostitute; if the movie didn't have the odd last scene where a bunch of Japanese soldiers dance to the victory, which is the biggest accomplice that makes the movie hard to appreciate; if the movie filmed more about every story directly concerning the Chinese people in it... If these changes happened, the movie could sure have the balance.But it's understandable, that the directer wants to encourage Chinese people to understand this history, it's exactly what a directer are supposed to do isn't it."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"As Lois McMaster Bujold said, ""There are always survivors at a massacre. Among the victors, if nowhere else."" That there may be disputes as to the actual number of causalities does not diminish from the fact, as reflected in the film, that the citizen of Nanking, China, were horribly brutalized during the fall of 1937 and that the memories of those events are seared into the collective consciousness of the Chinese people forever.Much has been made in the retelling of the story of Nanking about what the German John Rabe did to help save some of the people. While that is an integral part of the story, I think what is even more telling in the film are the heroic sacrifices (some ultimate, some not) that the citizens of the city made for each other in an attempt to save the women of the city from rape and to keep families, friends, and loved ones together.While this is not an easy film to watch, it certainly reflects much of the true nature of war.I bought the film. I would advise either seeing it in the theater or renting it, since is one that you will only watch now and again due to its strong nature."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I wonder how we live in a world full of this contradictions.. How hearts of producers, film makers, stars, composer and writers can contain all these overwhelming emotions in such balance.. I'm so overwhelmed and shocked of the movie.. First time I watch it was 3 years ago, but I didn't dare to make it again before I proceed in an intense control of myself, just I finished the second watching a while ago, and I can take my mind from every shot in the film.. It's great, devastating and overwhelming that I wouldn't recommend watching to anyone"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"No matter how our world may look polished at some parts and by hiding some parts of the truth in our world, there is bloody and massacre history we should all be awared of to honor victims of mankind who died brutally in very dramatic ways and massive bloodshed.. We may prefer to hide this part of our ""nature"".. But we should honor them as long as we shall live... Great production and cast.. Though I wouldn't dare to watch it again, but I always keep it on top of my collection"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"This is one of the best movie made about the Rape of Nanking during WWII and how the Japanese military treated the Chinese people. There was no law during War, all human rights and respect are lost in times of chaos and the only thing that matters was to survive. I've seen about almost every documentary there is about the Massacre of Nanking and WWII. This movie really shows in details what the Chinese went through, and it also lets the viewer understand why the Chinese hated the Japanese so much after WWII. I'm Chinese myself and always hear my grandfather telling me when I was a child how he hated Japanese people and what they were capable of doing. This is one of the reasons why I was so interested in this topic/history during WWII, and after watching this movie, I could actually feel the disgust and hatred towards the Japanese by the Chinese people (especially the older generation). Although I already know a lot from watching documentaries, i.e: The rape of Nanking, and also researched and read a lot about this history. The movie really display in more detail of what really happened during that time. But I have to admit, there were also a lot not shown in the movie. For example, the beheading of the Chinese people with the Japanese Katana sword, where the Japanese soldiers would use the Chinese POW as target practise. Some survived these beheading with half their neck chopped, where some soldiers obviously didn't finish the job and went onto the next victim. In some parts of the movie, you can see heads hanging around the city, but no actual beheading was shown. The part where the Japanese military were so keen on destroying the safey zone set up by the Germans (their own allies), just to get to the Chinese women in there and use them as 'comfort women', just shows what kind of people they were back then and they had no morale on their actions. The Japanese did not treat the Chinese as human beings, they thought they were superior to everyone else on the planet and that was their education from the Japanese Emperor back then. Anyways, all in all, this is a great film for those that don't know what happened in Nanking in WWII and why the Americans helped the Chinese people and ended the War with the dropping of the Atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In a way, it was the only option to stop the Japanese as they were causing too much chaos from Asia to the South Pacific. The Japanese Emperial Army actually thought they could take over the World, which was their plan in the beginning. Until the Americans were forced to enter the War after they were attacked in Pearl Harbour by the Japanese. The US had no choice but to show the World they were the true leaders, and eventually returned peace and control to the World, and all of Asia. The US military were so much more stronger and had much more powerful weapons than the Japanese. The Japanese didn't realise this until it was too late, and at first, didn't wanted to surrender. The Japanese brain washed so many Asian countries and Asian people, where the Asian women and children thought the Americans were evil and that if they were caught by the Americans, they would kill and rape them. So many committed suicide when the Americans came to rescue them from the Japanese, but in fact, it was the Japanese people that were the evil ones and doing the raping and killings!!! Watch this movie as a documentary; The movie was filmed in black and white which makes it even more believable and a realism to the whole event."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"What a watch. The movie is excellently made, you can relate to the characters,and as others have stated it doesn't take sides. But it is a very dark movie, makes you really think what we are as human beings,and how we can **** things up this bad.Definitely not your Friday night movie, but a great, deep movie to watch when you feel like it. I saw it on television tonight without any knowledge of it beforehand. The utter sadness of the film is constantly present and it is just hard to watch altogether.As the top review said, it's like a punch in the stomach. Indeed this movie hurts. A lot."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,If you prefer brutal realistic war movies than action hero Hollywood garbage then this is a movie for you.Gives you a depressive view of the Imperial Japanese occupation of Namkin in China showing what war can do to men and does not pick sides. Highly recommend this movie about a highly forgotten part of the start of WW2.
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"all people is victims in the war, we hate war although we suffered so much awful things in ww2. this movie still has its some weak points,it is not so perfect as Schindler's List , but it is enough for people in the world to remember this human's nightmare in 1937.even now,this slaughter is still evasive in Japan,i know,maybe because modern Japanese want to show their peaceful image to the world,but it is wrong to avoid the truth in the history.there are lot of data about that invasion and that slaughter in Japan,if anyone in Jpan want to know the truth,it is easy.but why ,why they avoid to face the truth?that is biggest reason why lots of people in china don't believe Japan.we are not born to hate Japan,but Japanese government should do something honestly to face that war and that slaughter. no war! no slaughter! we need peace!wish all people in the small world will be friends!"
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I was not familiar with the real life story of what happened at Nanjing. It would have been very easy for a director to exploit and over-dramatise this sordid piece of human history, yet Lu Chuan and his wonderful cast have done a fantastic job here.The acting is absolutely top rate. Not a hint of melodrama in sight, nothing overdone and the brutal horror of war, especially that directed at civilians comes across at exactly the right pitch. So much of the story is told simply in facial expressions that the horrors committed in the city did not need to be graphically or gratuitously filmed. Brilliant underplaying by the cast which is surely also a reflection of the directors vision and intelligence.Yes, some of the scenes are violent and brutal, but (at the risk of repeating myself) they simply and in a matter-of-fact way show what people are capable of. The fact that this was done almost as if one were watching a documentary or even as a witness places this film light- years away from the ""Let's find heroes and villains"" feel of many Hollywood war films.I'm not often moved to rush off and write a review of a film which only shows how moving this work is. I can't give it high enough praise."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Film title: Nanking! Nanking Director: Chuan Lu Year of release: 2009 Before I saw the film ""Nanking! Nanking"", I have already watched some of the movies made back in the 80's/90's about the rape of Nanking. They are exploitation movies and never affected me or leave me with profound experience. I'm actually disgusted with them making such movies. Also most of the documentaries I watched never really do anything. But when I watched the movie ""Nanking! Nanking!"" directed by Chuan Lu, it really drained me emotionally. When I first time watched the movie in cinema, it shocked me. And I think Chuan Lu is a pretty courageous and a respected director. I need to explain the reason why he is a courageous and respected director. At the first of the film, the lens showed us broken fences of Nanking, and the city was full of the dense smoke. The images made audience feel repression. But it is just a beginning. When we move on with the film, we would find that there are just two colors for the film, black and white. Maybe most of the audiences will doubt that if there is a problem of the film. Why it is not in color. But audiences will agree with the color soon. There is no more other color can fit this history than black and white. It is one of the reasons that why I think Chuan Lu is a courageous director. He used the black and white to explain the war. It is pallid and helpless. We can really feel the depressive emotion, which was brought from the color of the movie. And the most difference between ""Nanking! Nanking!"" and other same theme movies is the position of the director. Most of the directors add their own emotion to their film, so that they try to put up the good side of Chinese soldiers into the film and forget the bad side. And they also vilify Japanese soldiers from everywhere in order to accuse Japan and vent their emotion. It is easy to lead audiences' emotion. But people always forget the real part. ""Nanking! Nanking!"" is the different one. Chuan Lu didn't use the Chinese soldiers or Chinese people as the mainline of the movie. He was talking about the rape of Nanking through a Japanese soldier's view. Maybe it was also not the real image of the event, but I can feel that it would be the image, which was the most close to the real. Chuan Lu is very audacious on this. He didn't stand on the position of Chinese people. He filmed the movie in neutrality. I also saw some comments of this movie online. Most people said that the description of Japanese soldiers was humanness in the movie, even though the movie showed the vulnerable side of Japanese soldiers. People cannot understand that with nation hatred. They think Japanese soldiers should be the totally devil in the rape of Nanking. So there were a lot of voice of censure on the comments of the film and the director. But in fact, we cannot lose our mind because of the nation hatred between China and Japan. We need to face the truth and we need to see the depth effects of the war. Of course, we can forget the nation hatred. But we also have to accept that Japanese armies are not the real devil. In this film, Chuan Lu tried to stand on a middle position to state the rape of Nanking. So we can feel that the whole movie is very repression but rationality. Chuan Lu is a courageous director, and he is also very respected. The movie stated the rape of Nanking. But it is not in order to lead off emotion of nation hatred. It is a warning to Chinese people, and also the whole world. It is not simply a movie for Chinese people to deepen their hates on Japanese; it is a movie for people all over the world to see, to experience and to explore what Japanese have done to Nanking in 1937, and what the war has bring to us. This movie was shot without hates without slants without sharp emotions. But the images always warn us that war is the real devil in the world. I can remember that when I came out from the cinema after the movie, the first feeling was that how good is the current world in peace. And I think that peace is the main theme of the movie, not hatred. And the movie has demonstrated the most powerful thing in the world: no matter Japanese admit the fault or not, we may forgive, but never forget."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,This movie shows you an accurate depiction of the things that were happening in the 1-3 weeks within Nanking. It shows you horrors of the massacres and war crimes committed by the Japanese against the chinese people.Justice for Asia!
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Incredible film which had me engaged from start to finish,a piece of history I never knew about.Filmed in black and white like Schindler's list it seems to draw you in making scenes of a shock nature even more thought provoking. The battle scenes are well done well and the camera captures the desperation of the refugees as well as Individuals of the invading army. Great acting throughout with stand out performances from the lead cast,harrowing at times, but if you like your war films that make you think long after the film has finished certainly along the lines of schindlers list, come and see,downfall,Gallipoli...this may well be up your street.Recommended viewing."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"As a Chinese people, the film gives me impact and shock strength is very huge, both visually or psychological, this movie is successful angered the heart of every Chinese person. The film is ""city of life and death"", but I prefer to call this movie Chinese name ""Nanjing! Nanjing""! Just as a Chinese person, can't forget in 1937 the war occurred in Nanjing, that extremely cruel massacre.The whole movie with black and white color, to cover all the scene audience a dark heavy feeling, the from head to tail sending out great sadness, the film was completely breakthrough of the Nanjing massacre of old Chinese historical mistake description, with a brand new perspective apply colors to a drawing gives Chinese indomitable spirit, for this period of bitter past history provides a new history. In the film many scenes leave me very deep impression, the movie I only see again, but all plot I can remember, just like your own personal experiences like massacre, every scene each kind of feel like the scene. This movie can be divided into two parts to narrative, dominated by a soldier, he told LuJianXiong, he start stubborn resistance Japanese aggression, to final defeat by means of deadly, the Japanese killed every soldier, all soldiers tragically heroic sacrifice the senseless slaughter was started after. The second part about the Japanese aggression Nanjing after cruel method, a German he name is John rabe , he established security zone and protect some an unimportant person, from these little more shocking content shows exactly. Connect the two section discourse is two characters: a Chinese young soldier small beans"", one is the Japanese army of Jiaochuan, is their horns outline of the entire movie.Movies have much role give me more impresses, after watching the movie I was produced infinite admiration for that woman, they are not because cowardice to chose overlie in Japanese, and they are used to accept humiliation of form defending China's dignity. Director Lu chuan describe every role has potential significance, also have the same characteristics, that is dignity, representing Chinese dignity, a kind of not succumb spiritual shock all audience's heart. Facing the piles of bodies and the enemy's machine guns, face the death chanting ""China is not the died"" some ordinary people . Miss Jiang slowly raised his hand, voice soft, but particularly the punchy says ""John rabe sir， I will go!"" JiangShuYun teacher said to Jiaochuan ""kill me"", they were not fear death, but choose the dignity of die, choose in its own way transmits indomitable spirit. I am very like the character of miss Jiang， when all women are afraid of being comfort women , she stood out, she is brave, so the weak woman to choice surrender for China's dignity yield, roiled all the audience, at her to say ""I will go"" this moment, so strong and sad, moved all the audience, impressed everyone, only in this beautiful moment. She finally use this move toward the audience also to the Japanese film proved their noble soul. And let me impressive role is a Japanese, director Lu Chuan let this Japanese became the whole movie is the main line, Jiaochuan of Japanese military edge, the same time his side crime also side struggle, or that he still keep in the individual consciousness of humanity, keeping human nature thinking. Then finally, Jiaochuan released small beans and another Chinese refugee, then suicide. Before death, he told the soldiers said: ""to be alive than dead harder to do"". Lu Chuan also borrows by the role of the Japanese aggressors finished to humanity, but also reveals the reduction of the theme of the film, in the driven by humanity war just more pathetic! The last film, Lu chuan control in this story's people, with the form of the introduction of a list of things, those true and real name, that covering real desperation and fear of face, the film for each person, there are such look desperate, fear, but unyielding. The film about Chinese history, about China the tragic condition in Nanjing, although we cannot experience that war, but from the film we can be deeply felt that grief and indignation mood, film not just how heavily explained the massacre, more let us see the Chinese people's indomitable side, brave to defend our own nation, and in a few little people, show that between dignity, really let a person had to admire. it is the best Chinese film that i have ever seen ,yet let me shock is the biggest movie also let me deeply understand the life under the peace of the world how precious, also let people of now more cherish peaceful life. Our Chinese person in order to future must remember history, cherish peace and for the peaceful better tomorrow to work harder. """

南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"Probably the most well produced and most importantly, objective, portrayals of the Nanking Massacre yet. What makes it so compelling is that nearly half of the film is from the Japanese perspective and the character of Private Kadokawa essentially becomes our protagonist. Though playing only an auxiliary role or no role at all in most the crimes, he undergoes a spiritual erosion that is stalled only by a romantic interest in a comfort woman he becomes overly attached to. On the other side of the spectrum is German businessman John Rabe and his secretary, Mr. Tang. Along with Tang's wife, these two men do the most in their power to establish and maintain an international asylum for civilians and wounded soldiers, however with all his pull as a member of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, there is physically nothing to stop Japanese soldiers from waltzing in and taking whatever they please, shooting whoever they please and generally terrorizing the inhabitants within.The two threads overlap often as Kadokawa eventually becomes a Kempei and plays a larger role in suppressing resistance and seeking out Chinese soldiers in hiding. Learning a small amount of English in his church's school, he is able to have rudimentary conversations with the similarly religiously taught women of the International Zone. All of this comes to an emotional head when the women are taken to become army prostitutes and as Kadokawa knows, eventually executed. His character is concretely defined when he was is asked in English by a passing captive to ""shoot (her)."" and he obliges, much to the confusion of the two men taking her off to amuse themselves with her.Surrounded by absolute hopelessness and destruction, the great crisis transforms from escape to acceptance and many a character are forced to come to terms with the deaths that closely await them - until in the films final and most poignant sequence, Kadokawa and a comrade escort two Chinese prisoners out in the fields on the outskirts of the city and release them. Awestruck, the Chinese slowly walk with no destination towards some other later fate, while the two Japanese men are left alone. When Kadokawa salutes to excuse the other, he does not salute back but rather bows. As he returns to the city and leaves our ""hero"" alone, he suddenly stops and calls his name, then bows again, this time a full, deep and lingering bow of the utmost reverence. After so much wanton rape and murder, Kadokawa has become the very personification of the humanist spirit unextinguished.Beautifully shot and acted by a multilingual cast, the only hiccups I found grating were with the foreign volunteers. John Rabe almost never speaks German and when he does he's being dubbed by someone else, and some unnamed American doctor seems to possess a thick Swedish accent. The rightfully American Minnie Vautrin is too obnoxious to be sympathetic and there is even one puzzling scene when Rabe replies to a Japanese officer before the present interpreter can even relay what was said to him. Despite these minor flaws, and the volatile subject matter, this is an especially powerful film and one that can be received by broader audiences than earlier Chinese films about Nanjing. The violence is primarily execution by rifle and pistol. The most infamous tales of bayonet practice and beheadings are not shown, although there is a brief shot of severed heads nearly a quarter into the film. Rape is shown mostly off camera save for one establishing shot where a group of men holding a woman down on a table tear open her blouse - but actual sexual content is more implied than shown, which is more emotionally effective anyway. The massacre is portrayed not as a ludicrously inhuman orgy of depravity, nor is it an industrious mechanism for complete and unwavering ethnic cleansing - it occupies some bizarre whimsical middle ground wherein life is spared when it is too much trouble to extinguish, and it is taken when it is too much bother to accommodate. At any rate, the film is banned in Japan, as to be expected.I've left out a lot, such as the early combat sequences that will distract enough to think you're watching a conventional war film until things...turn sour. These are expertly choreographed and acted - weapons and uniforms are authentic, sound design is professional and visceral and all the kills ""feel"" right. The post-Saving Private Ryan motifs are present, but subtle and the stark black and white thankfully sidesteps the genre's new favourite faded-colour effects. Speaking of choreography, the film also features prominently the victory celebration for the capture of Nanjing, which comprises of a rather complex and ordered formation dance with a pair of taiko drums lifted on shoulders behind them. Marching down a main thoroughfare before a solemn audience, the men painstakingly repeat their routine for the entire length. While I don't know the specific ins and outs of this Shinto rite, it was definitely fascinating. There's not much else to say, except that this is a film that needs to get out there and be seen."
南京！南京！,City of Life and Death (2009),,2009,2011.05.11,"I once lived in Nanking for almost 4 years when I was a university student. There is a John Rabe's house located nearby Nanjing Univercity(Gulou District). Everyone in my university knows the existence of Nanking maccacre in 1937, but that's just a number for us, not a vivid emotional impressions. Our propaganda department taught us to hate Japanese simpily and all the wars between China and Japan was filmed every every year. They simply mixed the Japanese militarism and the general Japanese citizens.From this movie, I can get the truth of that massacre, it's not that simple, in fact, everyone suffers a lot from that war, not only the Chinese victims but also Japnese girls or the soldriers. The war is terrible and cruel, it hurts everyone in it. As I know, from our Chinsee history, during the dynasty changing, a lot of citizens have been killed to consolidate the new born govenment. So that's not only the problem of Janpanese, I think that's the dark side of human being. When there is no constaints to the human beings, the evil will occupy the heart of human beings. I just don't want to see any war between human beings. But I know it's impossible, I just hope everyone can understand that the life and love is very valuable."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"If you are not familiar with Chinese cinema then ""Shaolin"" could be a good movie to start out with as an introduction to the wonderful world of Chinese cinema. It has lot of action, a phenomenal assembly of acting talents, a good story and nicely choreographed martial arts.I have been putting off watching ""Shaolin"" for a long, long time after I had purchased this movie from Amazon. A thing that turned out to be a mistake on my behalf, because this really is a good movie. And of course it would be very unlikely not to be good with Andy Lau in the leading part.I bought this movie for two reasons; the first reason was, of course, Andy Lau, and the second reason being that this is a Chinese martial arts drama.""Shaolin"" also has a small role for martial arts legend Jackie Chan, and even in a supporting small role he shines, and really did add his usual charms and charisma to the movie.I enjoyed ""Shaolin"" quite a lot and was genuinely surprised at captivating the story was and how good director Benny Chan is at telling a story to the audience.If you enjoy Asian cinema then you most definitely should take the time to watch ""Shaolin"". And for a historical drama, then ""Shaolin"" is a movie that is more than deserving a place in the movie Collection of any fan of the genre."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I almost skipped this flick when I saw the low 6.8 rating on IMDb. And to be honest, that would've been really unfortunate! Remember the kind of movies that leave something behind in your hearts long after they've finished running? Well, this is most certainly one of those. The background score and soundtrack will linger in your head, I guarantee you that. But most importantly, just when you THINK you've figured it all out and stamped it 'just another Kung Fu flick'; all ready to be discarded and disregarded, wait for the kicker...!A simple yet significant moral, getting to know the Buddhist way, beautiful locations, and commendable direction to top it off; This movie truly had the potential to be an epic. Almost...!I thought I'd go with an 8 at first...but finally decided on a full 10; forgiving its small flaws to make way for the bigger message this movie delivers..!"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The 1982 gongfu classic ""Shaolin"" introduced Jet Li to the world, but there is no breakout star to be found here in Benny Chan's take on the famed birthplace of Shaolin martial arts. No matter really- though Heavenly King Andy Lau may not have the moves or the agility to match Jet Li, his leading man performance here is no less terrific. Indeed, what Andy lacks in the physical department, he more than amply makes up for with his dramatic chops, delivering a deeply moving performance as the arrogant and scheming warlord Hou Jie who undergoes a 180-degree transformation under the tutelage of the Shaolin monks.This transformation is at the heart of Benny Chan's film, which differentiates itself splendidly from the recent crop of period epics with a generous infusion of Buddhist teachings. These nuggets of wisdom elevate ""Shaolin"" into a surprisingly thoughtful film, meditating on the fruitlessness of anger, violence and hatred, and preaching ever persuasiveness the merits of peace, compassion and love. Non-believers however need not fear- Benny's sure hand never lets the film become sanctimonious, instead emphasising the universal truths of these teachings and demonstrating their truism through a heartfelt yarn.Written by no less than four writers, the story is a gripping one of repentance and renewal set amidst a time when China was torn apart by internal strife and threatened by foreign powers. General Hou Jie was one such local warlord, his hunger for power matched by that of his second-in-command, the equally scheming Cao Man (Nicholas Tse). A compelling opening sequence introduces Hou Jie and Cao Man as the despotic men they are (at least at the start), chasing an enemy right into the compounds of the Shaolin temple and paying no heed to the abbot's words to let him save the dying man.Hou's victory though is short-lived, as an ambush on his sworn brother whom he suspects of ill intentions goes awry. The orchestrator is none other than Cao Man, whose own tyrannical ambitions Hou had fomented over the years. In a reversal of fate, the film plants Hou at the doorstep of the Shaolin temple, seeking the monks' help to rescue his badly wounded young daughter. There is an obvious play on the Buddhist concept of karma here- but rather than dwell too much on these implications, Benny shrewdly grounds this turn of events in keenly-felt poignancy, underscoring their importance as a defining moment in Hou Jie's subsequent metamorphosis.Whereas lesser directors may have been tempted to skim through Hou Jie's redemptive journey, Benny exhibits an assuredness in allowing the movie to settle down to a more measured pace before its action-packed, explosive (literally) finale. He also brings on Jackie Chan in an amusing role as the resident Shaolin cook Wu Dao, a laid-back fellow perfectly content with his circumstance. It is not unlike the one Jackie played in ""Little Big Soldier"" two years ago, but it's always enjoyable to see the veteran gongfu actor back on screen, especially in a particularly entertaining sequence where he uses his cooking skills to good measure against Cao Man's soldiers.Other notable supporting roles include Wu Jing as the senior Shaolin monk Qing Neng and Hou's mentor, as well as Xiong Xin Xin (best known as Ghost Feet Seven in the Wong Fei Hung series) as Cao Man's evil henchman Jiang Yuan. Unfortunately, the script doesn't quite do justice to the actors playing these supporting roles- Xiong's character and Fan Bingbing's one as Hou Jie's wife Yan Xi are sorely underwritten and a waste of their considerable talent. If there is one consolation, it must be that Benny has given Andy ample screen time to flesh out the complexities of his character.And what a job Andy does, equally effective as the egotistical warlord on the pursuit of riches and power and as the reformed monk who realises the folly of his past ways. There's never been a doubt that Andy possessed screen charisma, but here he rewards Benny's attention to his character with a richly nuanced and textured portrayal of a man struggling to overcome his angry and violent tendencies to become a better person. Just as impressive is his gongfu, though no match for Jet Li's naturally but still admirable nonetheless- especially when he duels with Nicholas with a long wooden pole.Thanks to some nifty action direction by Corey Yuen and choreography by veteran stunt people Yuen Tak and Lee Chung Chi, the action sequences do not disappoint. But ultimately, the strength of Benny Chan's ""Shaolin"" lies in how surprisingly intellectual and deeply moving it is- intellectual in its Buddhist leanings of the vicious cycle war, hatred and greed perpetrates; and moving in its portrayal of one man's redemptive journey to free himself from his sinful past. It is a blockbuster in every sense, from spectacle, to emotion, and most of all spirit.www.moviexclusive.com"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Shaolin is an action packed, dramatic epic in the same vein as the Tom Cruise vehicle The Last Samurai. It also takes place on around the same time period, but in a time of turmoil in China where warlords fought over the land much at the expense of the masses. Warlords, which Andy Lau also appears in is great as well and I highly recommend that movie also. Anyhow, Andy Lau gives an outstanding performance here as Hou Jie. Hou Jie is a ruthless warlord general. His unscrupulous actions catch up with him that result in him taking refuge in a Shaolin temple he once disrespected. His second in command (played by Nicholas Tse) picks up where Hou Jie left off, exceeding his predecessor in immorality and cruelty. The legendary Jackie Chan appears as a lighthearted support role as cook for the Shaolin monks. This tale of redemption is a very well crafted film by HK veteran director Benny Chan. The film looks beautiful and is very well performed, shot and directed. Jet Li's preferred fight choreographer Corey Yuen set up the action, which of course is awesome and there are large helpings of it as well. Shaolin should please most action fans and has the potential to win over viewers who normally stay away from this sort of stuff, as this is very well made and an excellent dramatic film in its own right."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The Shaolin movie I know, was one in the 80s that launched the film career of Li Lianjie, who somewhat faded away until his portrayal of Wong Fei Hong in Once Upon a Time in China that launched him to superstardom. Superstars aren't lacking in this update of Shaolin Temple which promises spectacular action sequences, but what's surprisingly excellent here isn't the action, but the spirit of Buddhism and themes that come along with it.It isn't a remake per se of the old Shaolin Temple movie given a fresh set of characters and a premise that's remotely similar, set after the fall of the Qing dynasty with warlords battling it out for supremacy and territory in China. In what I thought was quite a stark message in warning of any future infighting amongst the Chinese if they do not stand united, that foreign powers are more than willing to wait for an opportunity to exploit. Economic advantages offered should also be scrutinized beyond immediate gains, where corruption of the few in power would mean severe losses on a national scale.That aside, this film centers itself squarely on the central character of the ruthless and cunning warlord Hao Jie (Andy Lau), who has no qualms in constantly gaining upper hands amongst enemies and allies even. In a wrongly calculated move to take on his sworn brother in an ambush, his protégé Cao Man (Nicholas Tse) probably had understood his mentor's philosophy that no man is indispensable to quash his insatiable appetite for power and glory, and through the countless of indoctrination in the Hao-Jie-School-of-Thought, it is no wonder that Cao Man ultimately decides to betray his master. Think of it as striking when the iron is hot to become top dog and making decisions, rather than taking them.In a tale about retribution and karma, Shaolin doesn't deviate very far from those themes, of how evil intentions can lead one astray and suffer inconsolable consequences, only for religion to point one back to the path of righteousness and all things good. In some ways this resembled the story of Huo Yuanjia in Fearless, where pride comes before the fall of man, stripping him of everything and down to his core, then comes the rebuild of character, and ultimately walking the talk and redemption. Hao Jie's story follows this trajectory and there's no qualms about Andy Lau being cast in this dramatic role despite his lack of real martial arts skills as compared to his other counterparts in the film, opposite the likes of co-stars Nicholas Tse, Wu Jing, Xing Yu, Xiong Xin Xin and Jackie Chan who serves as comic relief as a Shaolin monk-cook.But most of the co-stars were severely under-utilized, as the story, with responsibility coming from no less than five writers, didn't pay the others too much attention. Nicholas Tse probably had the meatier role as the chief villain who schemes and sneers, while the rest are in to showcase more of Shaolin martial arts in one film, except for Xiong Xin Xin being the villainous sidekick to Cao Man, with no dialogue. Wu Jing, Xing Yu and Ye Shaoqun all starred as the requisite monks caught up in the firefight as the latter two become part of a group who steals from the army to feed the villagers. Fan Bing Bing was a complete waste as the token female amongst the cast, and although she had a scene or two in a big action sequence in an ambush, little can be said once she appears on and off as the damsel always in distress.Action direction came from Cory Yuen, with choreography courtesy of Yuen Tak (responsible for Gallants) and Li Chung Chi, all veterans in their field, so quality is almost assured when the combatants take on each other, although I must say that most fights ended as soon as they began, which is a pity. Quality also goes toward the art direction, with production values culminating in the recreation of the Shaolin Temple, made to resemble a bastion of compassion open to all and sundry displaced by warring factions seeking refuge at its doorsteps in tumultuous times.Benny Chan's filmography may have blown hot and cold in recent years, but Shaolin establishes him back at the top of the game able to handle a big budgeted spectacle that doesn't necessarily rely on star power and action to deliver the goods, but actually is a thinking man's film on the philosophical aspects of Buddhism, and the balance of Martial Zen. Recommended!"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"For some reason I passed on watching this a few times. Very glad I chose it to watch tonight. I think the story and message is so amazingly well portrayed as well as the choreography and quality of movie making extremely tasteful and well done. If you've seen Ip Man, or Fist of Legend, or any movie on those levels, and have any appreciation of this genre of martial arts movies...I completely and whole heatedly suggest watching this movie. I was going to suggest to see the trailer, but I think it is best to watch without seeing the trailer. The production and direction of story telling, acting, and showmanship is top notch and I believe anybody can become a better person after seeing this movie."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The first hour of this movie is great and brings out a solid emotional story mixed with kung-fu. But the second half it starts to become pretty darn ridiculous with poor development. And loses the emotional value it started out with. The story is basically about a warlord Hao Jie(Andy Lau) that starts off as a man that angry full with ambitions of power and wealth but also lacks compassion. And don't blink an eye even when taking lives. And his right hand man is Cao Man(Nicholas Tse). Hao Jie chooses his ambition and tries to wipe out his own sworn brother in war. And Cao Man uses it as an opportunity to overthrow Hao Jie. And Hao Jie becomes a wanted man and ends up in a shaolin temple. And Hao Jie starts to learn the ways of the shaolin temple. Hao Jie also meets one of the head monk by the name of Jing Neng played by jacky wu who looks like the Korean actor Chun Jung-Myung a lot. Andy Lau did a good job of playing the cold character and also a sympathetic one. Nicholas Tse tries to pull off that drunk don't give a crap looking like high all the time type of villain. But he doesn't quite seem to pull it off like how Lee Byung-hun is able to pull off. The problem is with this movie is that there just isn't enough development where it's needed. Hao Jie makes a 180 degree change way too drastically and some of the characters you don't get attached to at all. Although they take up some screen time. This is mainly do to a lot of the deleted scenes that is added on to extras for the DVD. In fact I think some deleted scenes should have been added onto the movie. Cause some parts has some character development so it adds to the value of those characters. So when they die it actually leaves a bit of an impact. But that isn't the case for this movie, I honestly didn't care who lives or who dies just which side wins as the end. I usually always like Jackie Chan in movies but his over the top kung-fu takes away from this movie. Since this is a serious kung-fu flick and not a fantasy one. If this carried the flare it had for the first half with the second half it would have been a great film but as it is. It's a pretty mediocre flick.6.6/10"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"In 1982, The Shaolin Temple puts Jet Li into the spotlight as a young man highly skilled in martial arts, which path-ed his acting career into the fame he has today.Around 29 years later, director Benny Chan comes with a new adaptation of the classic, which shares a similar story with a new cast. Here, we have Andy Lau, Li's co-star in The Warlords (2007) taking the leading role of Hou Chieh, a ruthless warlord who crosses path with Shaolin Temple and sees transformation of himself from a ruthless warlord to a monk with compassion. Together with Nicholas Tse and Jackie Chan in a special appearance, Shaolin marks the first Chinese blockbuster to hit the screens of Asia in 2011.The story is set in China after the fall of Qing Dynasty with various warlords fighting over the territories. Hou Chieh, a ruthless warlord who bear grudges with Shaolin Temple and sets to get rid of the people around him for his own benefits, was betrayed by his right-hand man, Tsao Man (Tse). It not only leads to the death of his daughter, but also makes his wife (Fan Bing Bing) decided to leave him for good. After being taken refuge by the cook (Chan), the cook enlightens him and Hou decided to become a monk in Shaolin, leaving down the past behind him and start a new life. Though disciples in Shaolin bears grudges with Hou in the past, they accepted Hou. Eventually, we will see how Hou and the disciples defend Shaolin from the invasion of Tsao's army and the Western powers.The plot sounds no novelty in it, where we can see how the protagonist repents from his sin to the mistake made in the past, to how they will defend in what they believe in. Here, we have seen how the Buddhist teachings have been integrated into the plot. In relating to the Buddhist teaching on the term 'you reap what you sow' with cause and effect, Hou saw the fall of his power and death of loved ones by betrayal, which he gets it from his belief of the dog eat dog world.Another perspective of Buddhism that can be seen in Shaolin is 'evil begins with the greed and obsession for power'. This is shown by the portrayal of the sufferings from the civilians during the civil war, with warlords fighting for power and wealth. The perspective has become the main theme of the movie, where not only we have seen how Tsao wanted to control the territory, but also the Western powers who aims to take over China using gun power. This has somehow reflect on what has happened in today's society, on how stronger bodies are getting rid the culture, values and history using destructive powers.Lau's role of Hou Chieh is different from Li's leading role in Shaolin Temple, in terms of characters and the incidents they have been through. Both shared similarities in their fate and enlightenment, to how they find a way to save the majority of the people around them. Chan's cameo appearances as the cook provides some comic relief for the audience after having a long intense and pressure from Tse's evil character. The comic relief did not last very long, since the fate of Shaolin Temple is the main concern of the film.Overall, Shaolin makes a very good start for Hong Kong's film industry in the beginning of 2011, where it not only shows how Hong Kong film industry are making a turn from various disappointments in 2010, but also pins hope for better productions in the coming months."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I admire the effort and thought that's gone into the making of this movie. The producers obviously wanted something set at the much-revisited and revered Shaolin Temple, but in the meantime had to work in a storyline that's a bit different to the usual ""novice monk training"" style stuff. What we get is the tale of a very bad man (a glacial Andy Lau) who undergoes something of a crisis of conscience before being reborn as a pacifist fighter. Yeah, the motivations don't make a whole lot of sense, but in the end this is an action flick and it's absolutely packed with battles and that's what counts.Director Benny Chan is an old hand at this sort of stuff, of course, although he's more familiar with contemporary fight flicks (INVISIBLE TARGET etc.). Still, he acquits himself well with the historical backdrop, throwing in elaborate chase scenes, some genuinely impressive and explosive set-pieces, and of course all manner of hand-to-hand combat. The entire film builds up to one massive, sprawling set-piece at the climax which mixes large-scale combat with fights on an individual basis, and it really works. The special effects are exemplary.The story I'm less enamoured with. Lau seems slightly disinterested in the material, and I never felt much sympathy for his character's plight. The non-violence message is a bit preachy and faintly ridiculous when played out over two guys beating the hell out of each other. Nicholas Tse feels a bit uncomfortable in a role that's a far cry from the usual fresh-faced hero types he usually plays, and Jackie Chan doesn't get much of a look in at all. Nonetheless, action fans will be in their element, and I just wish I'd been able to catch myself up in the storyline a little better so that I actually cared about the characters involved."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"There's nothing better than a film with an uplifting moral message bought to you interspersed with lots of martial arts action and blowing stuff up. I can therefore heartily recommend this film.Whilst being a good watch there is also some good old-fashioned silly translations to add to the enjoyment. ""Don't mess with the Shaolin Temple"" is one fine example and another is ""You bastards come and attack the temple, I'll send you to the Netherworld."" (I don't know if you get this with the English soundtrack as I was watching the subtitled version.) There's a solid storyline and the usual stuff about the baddie finding redemption and making good his evil ways but it's not as 2-dimensional as these plots often are as you see the effect on Andy Lau's wife and daughter in no uncertain terms. The martial arts action is good though not outstanding. Jackie Chan has a supporting role but when he does eventually get an action scene it is laugh out loud funny and absolutely true to the character he plays in the film.It's not the world's best film but it would be hard to go wrong with this if you want to watch an entertaining epic with lots of action. I'm intrigued to know how much of the battles scenes and destruction of buildings was CGI and how much miniatures. I suspect it was a mixture. I'll have to listen to the DVD commentary to find out"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"A wonderful movie in this genre. The story is dynamic, thought provoking and plays well with the incredible sets and fight choreography. Jackie Chan's supporting performance presents some comedy to the movie that often seems out of place and distracting. The ending sequence is epic in scope and leaves you feeling drained."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The battle between warlords complicates life in the Shaolin temple. When the winning warlord is betrayed, he eventually finds a safe place and solace in the temple. However evil never rests and soon a confrontation is brewing.This is film of massive set pieces. They are the sort of thing that makes you go wow. Capping it all off is the climax a huge action sequence that floor you with its non-stop action.Unfortunately the film is dramatically simple, perhaps a little too simple. The trouble is that the film didn't seem to have all that much depth beyond those minimally required for the story. The film his all the points it should for each sequence but little else. Other than the scale the film also seems to be tad TV movieish in execution.It's never bad, it's just not as great as the spectacular set pieces make you think it should be.Definitely worth a look, you'll just wish it was better."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"This might be the first film I've ever seen with Jackie Chan in a genuine supporting role. Since he started in films in the early 80s he has either been the STAR, the star, the co-star, or a mere cameo. There has been precious little in between.Until now.In an are in China where many warlords fought and struggled over territory and power, the Chinese Army were cruel and violent pricks – at least that's how they are portrayed here.One of the worst of these was leader General Hou Jie, he callously orders the killing of innocent villagers for fear that they may possibly be harbouring the enemy, and the killing of the enemy because well they're the enemy (can't argue that one). When his reluctant 2IC Cao Man expresses doubt at the level of violence and whether those targeted even deserve what is being dished out he receives an impromptu lesson: 'it is better to be the aggressor and be wrong than the passive dead guy', or something along those lines.On this day though they follow an enemy into peaceful monk territory, a Shaolin temple. While the monks refuse to take sides they will not allow violence on their turf, and they protect the man. Initially.Hou Jie backs down on his word and guns down the soldier in an act of proactive violence, pausing on the way out only to deface some sacred Shaloin signage. He gets home to his wife and adoring daughter who proudly shows him a drawing of him in action with the title 'My Daddy likes fighting' (I shouldn't judge, my boy might say 'My Daddy likes chips and beer!) Back in cautiously peaceful time Hou Jie becomes increasingly nervous about the prospect of being betrayed or attacked – even by his good friend and ally. In another unnecessary pre-emptive strike Hao Jie takes his friend out in cold blood purely to advance his own station and eradicate another potential rival and hindrance to his success.Unfortunately though Hou Jie's actions and teaching eventually (and inevitably) work against him, his former 2IC Cao Man betrays him and Hou Jie must seek refuge immediately but where? What follows is a generally rewarding tale of realisation and redemption. Jackie Chan (see how long it took to even mention him!) plays a humble and peaceful – yet eccentric – cook who kindly takes Hou Jie under his care.After a period of time Hou Jie embraces the life of a monk montage-style, shaving his head a la Britney for a clean start – albeit without the insanity – and finds peace for now. Because meanwhile Cao Man has effortlessly and successfully stepped into his shoes and is now just as ruthless and violent a leader.Confusingly enough in a film about a violent and cruel man realising the error of his ways we always know that this pro-peace film will end in violence, and the action in the latter part of the film is worth the wait. There is an ax-fight that seemed quite realistic and dangerous, a chariot chase (of sorts) and the wire work was used sparingly enough to be forgiven for the most part. Andy Lau proves himself an adept and reasonably athletic martial artist, and there is no shortage of random monks ready to throw down in self defense of course.It takes a long while but even Jackie Chan gets to try his aching muscles out near the end of the film, even though in truth his entire role and fighting scenes are thematically at odds with the rest of the film and stand out like a sore thumb. It is like Jackie has now entered the Brian Dennehy / Morgan Freeman phase of his career as the elder statesman, only every director – and perhaps even Jackie himself – can't help but remember that he was once the pre-eminent cinematic martial artist on the planet, so they clumsily try to work him in.Shaolin is a film book-ended by violence, the redemptive tale in the middle is supposed to provide the moral of the story I guess, but that could easily be forgotten by the 30 minute finale that ends in many dead when even the monks say 'enough'.Final Rating – 6 / 10. Muddled morals aside Shaolin is well acted, reasonably well paced (aside from one interminably long 'will she / won't she?' scene that I can't spoil here) and contains a few of the better martial arts sequences filmed in the last few years."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"In the mid-30s China has broken up into warring factions of warlords attempting to carve out power and influence between themselves. Amongst them Hou Chieh (Andy Lau), powerful and remorseless, aiming to achieve domination even at the expense of his blood brothers death. He disregards not only loyalties for his quest for power, but also tradition - openly ridiculing the Shaolin Temple in the opening sequence of the movie. His only deeper affection is directed towards his wife (Bingbing Fan) and sole child. However, such immorality rarely remains unpunished, as karma is a dog and is intent on biting back, when his second in command Tsao Man (Nicholas Tse) betrays Hou, thus causing the death of his daughter. Initially conquered by anger Hou plans revenge, but soon finds sanctuary in the Shaolin Temple, finding a friend and comfort in the local cook Wudao (Jackie Chan). Slowly he accepts his fate and finds peace within himself. Tsao Man however does not intend to leave his former comrade of arms alive...Another blockbuster extravaganza from China with great settings, beautiful cinematography and some well researched, brilliantly crafted period reconstruction. However under Benny Chan's direction, visibly placing style and swashbuckling melodrama over substance, even the great Andy Lau delivers a sobbing and disappointing performance. Only Jackie Chan seems somewhat comfortable in his goofish guise, as the somewhat aloof super-cook. This stylistic over-reliance on soapish dramaturgy lacks the same required restraint showed by directors such as Ang Lee, Xiaogang Feng or even John Woo, thus making the effort at times a cringe-worthy lesson in bad filmmaking. The best moments come during fight sequences, but even here a severe overuse of slow-motion in order to 'imbue' the tragedy or drama just tingles all the wrong receptors. Instead of dramatic the multitude of such scenes make the movie a yawn-inducing watch, which could obviously use drastic editing to cut down run time with no harm to story or substance."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"A competent and action pack Shaolin movie It is of a moment of distinction to proclaim that Benny Chan's latest blockbuster, not only revisited the glory days of Jet Li's first ever movie, but also reunited two of the biggest Hong Kong actors ever. Mr. Andy Lau and Mr. Jackie Chan appears on screen together for the first time since 1994's Drunken Master 2. The moment they appear together, the screen goes on fire. It is a special little segment that excites HK cinema fans, including myself. However, Shaolin fails to exceed the audience expectation and the result is a competent and efficient movie that contains wonderful action sequences, but nothing more.The real problem of director Benny Chan is not direction, but rather the criminal under usage of Fan Bing Bing and Nicholas Tse respectively. Tse for one, should be critical of his own performance. His villainous turn is neither convincing or menacing. In fact, he should take a leaf out of Mainland's actor, Liu Ye – book of acting. His evil laugh is more cheesy than imagined and his overacting is far too laughable than villainous. A poor effort from someone who have improved immensely in films like Beast Stalker and Pigeon Stool. As for Fan Bing Bing, she performs wondrously in her extremely limited screen time. Her teary eye caught my attention, but with just two significant scenes, she is officially wasted.All in all, Benny Chan improves from his previous Aaron Kwok's endeavor – City Under Siege. From cheesy to competent action blockbuster, Chan perfectly casted superstar Andy Lau in a role that allows him to go through the motions. At the end of the day, this is a highly effective film for what it is. Unfortunately as with most Benny Chan's movies, the film entertains, but fails to delivers anything special or original to make a good film, great. Basically, Shaolin is a good film, but not great(Neo 2011) I rate it 7.5/10www.thehkneo.com"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Andy Lau gives his all. And it certainly shows on screen. I do wonder why has he not done more Hollywood movies. Maybe he does belief parts of things that he said in this movie, cannot really tell you what it is, but I think those who have seen it get it. The effort to make this movie a little Hollywood-like certainly shows. I guess it is to attract audience. But I do miss closeups and landscape views, since they are not that many in this movie. Action scene is wonderful, but dimmed down to make pace of the movie. Overall it is understandable, though lacking in power and presence of the scene, Acting-wise, no complaints.I do feel sorry for the scene placements, it just doesn't make sense. It feels rushed at times, and slowed down quickly, than rapid changes of action scenes and dramatic scenes. And the music with it certainly did not help since there is countless time I thought the movie was over, but then the music and scene start action again. Needs to learn this one from the western counterpart.Speaking of western counterpart, the villains, damn they were awful. All of them, through the dire of Andy's acting, you get their presence. But without Andy, I would beat up the villain easily, they just look too nice, bad acting. But given the circumstances of the greatness of the movie, still A for effort. Lastly, the CG and Special effects. Just because you can do big, does not mean you must do big. Play it on occasion and it would look great. Play it too much and the power will fade away. I'm guessing that is why they cut and paste scenes overlapping too much when the action starts to get going. Should learn more from Lord of the Rings for the action scenes.Thank you."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"This is one of my favorite movies, period. It handles the evolution of a man from a brutal, uncaring fighter through the heights of success, to complete and shattering loss where he discovers what is truly important beyond himself. I could watch this over and over: thrilling action sequences, along with the story of a man's growth to true maturity, compassion and valor. This has it all! Great acting, visually stunning, worthwhile plot. Highest recommendation if you enjoy martial arts and foreign movies."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The Best: Buddha Nature. Realization of truth, although not detailed like in the movie soul. The thing is to get to that you need to have a certain mindset first.The Good: Action in limited space.The Bad: Weak story in third quarter.The Worst: Action in extended space (flying kindaa stuff)."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I'm not a big fan of Asian movies, however, it captivated me most of the time. It has plenty of action, intrigue, beautiful scenery and some humor, especially in the scenes played by Jackie Chan. The film is one that condemns greed and thirst of power, which eventually lead some characters to self-destruction. It also has parts that I didn't like, such as the floating through the air of shaolin fighters (exaggerations like this are still found in Chinese movies) and the soundtrack copied from the one in the movie Braveheart. All in all, a good action movie."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Shaolin is one of my favorite kung-fu movies. The story is so interesting and the nonstop action sequences are all fantastic. The actors do such a great job with showing their raw emotions. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes this type of movie. Not only is the kung-fu awesome to watch but there is also some comedy, tragedy, heroics, drama, action, love, revenge, and compassion."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"When hearing the name of Shaolin I immediately think kungfu. And there is just enough of that to make this movie your worth wile.However,this movie is just too serious and melodramatic for my taste. It is one tragedy after another. You will see people dying in almost every scene. Shaolin tries too hard to tell a message which for some reason doesn't get clear except for the most obvious one.Greed is bad and makes you kill people.Or something in that fashion. One could also argue if the message is that war in general kills people. Duh! Whatever the message is,it is killing the flow in the movie. Of course I like to see a nice story in an action movie. But most of the time that doesn't go together. The actors are completely wasted in this and they have shown much better in the glory days of the Kungfu genre. Try to enjoy this movie for the action and forget the rest or if you are up for it bring tissues."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"It's about life of a man who changed drastically after he loses everything. To watch this film is a spiritual journey. Makes me think about my own life,people I love in this mortal world, about secular desire,mortality, and my own fear of death. The monks are those with no fear of losing anything. They're not fear of losing matters, families, or even their own lives. But they do understand people. They fight for people so the people won't experience those loses.The actors and actress act really good. Perhaps the best of Andy Lau on his career. They successed to make me emotional through some scenes. The combination of the story,acting,dialogue, pictures, and soundtrack are beautiful. The soundtrack (the ending song) itself is beautiful if you understand the meaning. If you interested in the lyrics, here it is in English ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5cLjfBwDCE )Conclusion : beautiful, heart-touching, religious, humanize the audiences"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"China is being torn apart by feuding warlords and foreign powers. Hao Jie (Andy Lau) is a ruthless commander who kills all his rivals. He rejects foreign offers to built a railroad. His treacherous ways rebound on him when his underling Cao Man (Nicholas Tse) revolts with the help of the foreign power. Hao Jie loses everything including his precious daughter, and seeks help from Shaolin masters. He regains his humanity with their help including cooking monk Wudao (Jackie Chan).I like the solid first half. It is poetic, dramatic, and compelling. However the movie couldn't resist its kung fu movie genes, and it devolves into a lot of unreal fighting. The fighting is more ridiculous since the troops with guns keep getting kicked around by monks with their sticks. It's still a good movie. The action looks good. However the message loses a bit."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Shaolin is one of those stories that integrates a number of life lessons into an action adventure. This movie is akin to top grade martial arts films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon which has long been one of my personal favorites. The story gives the viewer something of a history lesson into the tyranny in China when warlords had no concern for the people only a desire to increase their territorial hold and gain power.In this story Hou Chieh commands a massive army that wages war to take control of the city Tengfeng,Henan, China. This ruthless, dispassionate tyrant is portrayed very convincingly by Andy Lau, who has quite an impressive film career, I recall him from House of Flying Daggers. Second in command to General Hou is Cao Man (Nicholas Tse) who is very astute in taking in all the Tyranny 101 lessons. This film had some off the chain equestrian stunts, with horses traversing stairs, doing front and side flips, whereas I could not help but to cringe at some of the scenes. I can only hope that no animals were harmed during the filming, so PETA is not up in arms, perhaps the visuals were the result of some very creative computer generated imagery, but things looked very real. This is a religious based film where the territorial war spills into the Buddhist monks Shaolin temple, we see that the monks are the only entity that cares for the people and the temple is the only sanctuary that the people have against the warring armies. There is a bit of a Robin Hood mini story taking place in the background of everything else that is going on with some of the monks at its core. I found it interesting that the Shaolin temple was identified as the birthplace of martial arts, having seen quite a few of these tales I do not recall credit being given for where it all began. There were several recognizable faces in this tale including the Shaolin cook, Wudao(Jackie Chan), this seemed like a small role compared to some of the other big movies he has performed in, but he did show he still has it where martial arts are concerned. This was a very entertaining story, with plenty of martial arts and other action so much so that the two hour running time is barely noticeable. I give this film a big Buddha green light."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Once again I hadn't read anything about the movie going in to watch it. Though I knew that Andy Lau was in it and with a title like that ... well what can one expect? A movie about Shaoling of course and one with quite a few stunts and fight scenes. And the movie delivers in that regard. It also had a ""surprise"" star (though again he is named here and can be seen on the poster and everywhere else) for me.On the other hand someone like Tse seems to almost bring the movie down. His character is laughable and there does not seem to be a big motivation behind some of his doings. But sometimes you need characters like that I guess. Overall, a decent movie that might entertain you, if you are into that sort of movies."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"This was a remarkable story of a General (Andy Lau) who became a Shaolin monk through tragedy. A man who had everything, a career, a wife and daughter, and a knowing ability to conquer anything in his path. Yet to quell his desires for fame and fortune, his subordinate Cao Man (Ncholas Tse) had set him up during a dinner party with the General's own superior. During this supposed get together, a militia team storms in and creates pure chaos in Cao Man's name. General Hou Jie (Andy Lau) escapes his death along with his wife and daughter who were then split up to escape on their own. During the frightful night, the General manages to rescue his daughter and to take refuge among the very monks he was trying to evict from the province. With his daughters death, his wife blames him for every bit of turmoil they had succumbed to and leaves him, which causes his path to open and learn the words humility and self sacrifice. During this time of self discovery, Hou Jie learns the art of Shaolin martial arts as well as becoming a kind of helper to those who really need it. His kind of mentor would be the cook (Jackie Chan) who gives in his own way the ability to see how a noodle bends, or cooks in boiling water. Not much of a teaching tool, but to Hou Jie, it was more than enough to calm his nerves and his soul. I found this to be a really uplifting film, to see a General find his calling, and to create a chain reaction to those who felt war was the only answer. Cao Man learnt this as his ex superior gave his life to save Cao Man's during a raid of one of the last monasteries in china's existence. A riveting action film packed with emotions, guns, the turning of the period to the twentieth century, and the music was top notch. Highly recommended for those who wish to see how China's survival depended on their most needed and most cherished institution -- 'The Shaolin Monks.'"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"This movie tells a lot about the Chinese Shaolin Temple and culture. I practise Shaolin Kung Fu in Apeldoorn the Netherlands and Always wanted this movie. I watched it, i got it and i was hooked on to it. Great acting and great insight knowledge about Chinese culture and philosophySincerely YoursDouwe Geluk"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Being a huge fan of Hong Kong and Chinese visual effects, I really wanted to see this one and also for Jackie Chan, although he didn't have a huge role to play in this one. Also action direction coming from veterans Cory Yuen, with Yuen Tak and Li Chung Chi, its definitely something not to be missed Benny Chan's films may not have been the best in the recent past but with Shaolin he definitely delivers a blockbuster. A movie which is not only high on action but also rich in the spirit of Buddhism.The main protagonist Hou Jie (Andy Lau), a ruthless warlord who bear grudges with Shaolin Temple and sets to get rid of the people around him for his own benefits, is betrayed by his own brother and repents from the mistakes he made which leads to the death of his daughter. The cook (Chan) at the temple takes him into refuge where Hou decides to become a monk at the Shaolin which is where the Buddhist teachings come in to play. Disciples in Shaolin who bear grudges with Hou for his deeds in the past eventually accept him and in the climax war they all defend Shaolin from the invasion of Tsao's army and the Western powers.Jackie Chan's cameo in an amusing role as the cook provides some comic relief for the audience in an otherwise intense plot which doesn't last for long since it deviates from the main concern of the film. But there is one fight sequence with Chan.But what I did miss was some beautiful landscape views, with its massive set pieces it was something that was expected. Also, apart from the main characters not much attention was paid to the co-stars. No female presence as such in an overall grand movie of all sorts.In the end its definitely worth a look, but you'll somehow just wish it was better. The climax with its awesome fight sequence and huge sets being exploded is also worth the watch."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I give this movie 5 stars, but that is just because of the action and the beautifully choreographed scenes. The Buddhist wisdoms are thrown at you as if it were by a TV reverend on coke. I am not at all against healthy morals in a movie, but the way this movie tries to stuff you with them is getting irritating. This movie is more religious than the Vatican. The music is also very annoying, not because it's Chinese, but because it sounds cheesy (and often sounds very western). The Chinese government can be proud. This is excellent stuff to feed your masses. It will keep them docile and loyal and hey, if we can feed them a healthy portion of distrust to western society... couldn't hurt either. Americans and westerners in general are all after our precious Chinese riches. However, Jackie Chan was refreshing as a not-martial-arts-man and the bad guy isn't bad either. The film definitely has its moments and if the above doesn't scare you off, you might very well enjoy it."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,Very good nice movie...The movie is very attractive and has become 100 times more attractive with Jackie Chan ...
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"A film about deception, loyalty and redemption never looked this good. Filled with emotion, this film will take you on an unexpected adventure with interesting twists and turns.The characters are well set-up and Andy Lau is excellent as the anti-hero turned hero. The film also features excellent character development. Visually stunning with incredible photography and cinematography, 'Shaolin' is also pleasing to the eyes.I've seen many car chase scenes over the years, but the carriage chase scene near the beginning of the movie is simply incredible and has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of spectacular! The film is guaranteed to stir your senses. It is an action-packed, emotionally charged film that will have you pondering over the many aspects one can relate to. This is a top notch production on every level.The grand finale is AWESOME!! 'Shaolin' is a beautiful movie."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"It's a martial arts movie with impressive special effects but the plot and dialog of a cartoon, which is just fine so long as you remember this is a Jackie Chan movie and suspend your disbelief. You will be invited to believe this film has depth but that's just window dressing played up by convincing actors. I felt like I was watching a grammar school production of King Lear since the directing kept on insisting it be taken seriously.Relax it's just a flick so eat your popcorn and have fun. I had to give it a 5 because of its inability to decide what kind of movie it wanted to be, a Kurosawa or a Jackie Chan with high production values."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Chinese compounded traditional martial arts is a fantastic and rather historic form of fighting, more commonly known as Wushu. This is a quite phenomenal mix of literally hundreds of forms and functional techniques in self defense. It of course is exceptionally popular in Asian cinema, and there is always that real sense of watching something unbelievably beautiful that has been passed down from generation to generation.'Shaolin' brings much of the same fighting styles from previous martial arts films of the last decade. It's hard to compare it to anything I have seen in recent years. I found the movie to be quite enjoyable, if a rather typical ride for most fans of Chinese Cinema. There is the typical overuse of wired stunts, which gives that somewhat graceful 'float' effect on their jumps and movements. When it's just left to the choreography of Jackie Chan and Andy Lao it is actually quite breathtaking to watch the seemingly effortless way they move their bodies in a whirlwind of fists and kicks.The story line is a rather serious topic for most films that come out of most successful communist country in the world. Most movies that come out of this part of the world are written, and re-written as to represent history in such a way that the government would approve of. This usually leads into a lot of fictionalization, just like any Hollywood drama. For example they leave out a lot of the history related to how many Shaolin Temples were destroyed over and over again in China's history, from the 16th century to even more modern times when rural warlords/generals set fire to monasteries throughout the country. The religious persecution during the communist cultural revolution still affects what can and cannot be shown in Chinese cinema, especially with religious themed films.Anyways, it is a beautiful movie to watch, some excellent dramatic moments through the whole thing, and very well acted. Most definitely one of my favorite movies out of China in the last decade.7/10"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"If you read most of my review, you know by now when it comes to Chinese martial arts movies there is something that annoys me a lot and its wire fights. I never understood the need of the Chinese to put ""obvious"" wire fights in there movies. Now for this particular movie, at least there aren't that much of them and they don't taint the movie too much. Wired seem to be used when it comes to jumping and landing, and for the fights themselves, there is a couple scenes involving them, but its nothing out of mind like Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragons. The story is nothing very original, but its effectively done and interesting. Overall Shaolin is a pretty good movie that looks like a lot of other Chinese classic but with a more modern look to it. The wire work is not too annoying and even if your not fan of it like me, you can watch this and love it too."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"SPOILERS!!! Andy Lau (Hou Jie) plays a blood thirsty tyrant who thinks nothing of eliminating all his opponents in cold blood - even if they happen to be his sworn brothers. Eventually the cruel and cunning Hou gets ambushed in a double-cross perpetrated by his trusted aide. Hou loses everything he cherishes and is forced to take refuge in Shaolin temple, one of the places he had desecrated in his search for an enemy.You can probably guess the rest. The movie's plot is not its strongest point but rather the characters and the acting. The fight scenes are excellent as well without going overboard on the wire-fu. The scenery and cinematography are excellent, looking very realistic.8/10"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"There's just no need for stories that have been already told in a simpler and fresher way in 30 years of kungfu movie. This is not an action movie because the action is scarce and mediocre (there's should be a rule setting a minimum of martial arts, in terms of quantity and quality, in a martial arts movie). Is not an historical movie. It's not a kungfu movie, because the martial art scenes are nothing special. The movie is slow, with excesses of drama and floods of fake dark blood. The plot is unreal. The cameo of Jacky Chan slowly turning into a second Sammo Hung has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of movies and has noting to do with the rest of the movie. With gems like Ip Man around, there's no one single reason to waste time on this pure nonsense. A boring melodrama, with poor action and an excess of histrionics."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"It was very visually impressive. It was packed with great actions. This movie had multiple A list actors like Andy Lau, Jackie Chan and Nicholas Tse and martial arts legends such as Wu Jing. This film had great character development and morals. A great villain and an amazing soundtrack."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Set in the Warlord Era (1916 – 1928), Lau plays the warlord Hou Jie who finally seizes control of Dengfeng in Henan Province but is afraid that his sworn brother, Song Hu (Shi Xiaohong), could take advantage of him and take everything. He then plans an ambush for Song. However, his deputy Cao Man (Tse) has other ideas and orchestrates a plan to eliminate both warlords, ultimately taking control of their armies.Losing his daughter in the attack, Huo Jie manages to escape and seeks refuge in a Shaolin Buddhist Monastery where he becomes the disciple of cook Wudao (Jackie Chan) and later progresses to become a warrior monk with assistance from his seniors Jingneng (Wu Jing) and Jingkong (Xing Yu). He also learns to control his anger and finally find peace. However, his former ally cum enemy Cao Man learns that he is still alive and sets out to kill him."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this film. The acting was on point and seeing the main characters grow and evolve was simply amazing. The story is so rich and is absolutely refreshing to watch. The main character's journey is just.... powerful, honest and epic. You know the story....Build yourself up to be torn down, only to be built anew again - the story of life in my opinion and this was just executed beautifully. Of course the cinematography was great. There was so much THOUGHT in some of the shots that told a story in itself. Just incredible! I experienced every emotion and was thoroughly entertained the entire time."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"The story line is really good and presented very well. The actors make the movie believable and entertaining: Five Stars to the cast. I am not sure of the historical context but it appears to have been based loosely on actual events...need to do some research. Violence was, in my opinion excessive...and was not needed to the degree presented to get the story across. While the movies disclaimers state that no animals were injured during filming, I have severe doubts of that claim. There are three scenes in which horses are tripped - one down a flight of stairs - and having raised horses, I know there is no way the animals could have survived those falls uninjured. Rating a 4 because of the violence."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"This movie is full of Chinese propaganda against foreigners and capitalism. You get plenty of propaganda against ""evil foreigners"" and plenty of buddhist self sacrifice ""wisdom"" thrown in your face throughout the entire movie.With that said, it is still a fairly enjoyable movie for its martial arts scenes."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I have to admit this was not one movie Andy Lau, was meant to be in: at least not a monk. At times the plot gets confusing though it makes me think: Why did he become a monk? I mean really it could have gone in an opposite direction. But the message is quite clear where cruelty is not an absolute answer to everything, with responsibility there is more steps you have to take to watch yourself. That is really quite it of what I watched this movie. 1. story line was quite weak with transition with the general turning into a monk, it almost seem like he was a coward. 2. though give them credit where its due which, there is compassion and forgiveness where Buddihism comes into play. Amazingly they only fight for their self righteousness and self defences. 3. overall I only would recommend viewers seeing this for time to kill or nothing else to do. When i say it missed the mark it seemed like I was watching Ghandi, but the shortened version. The best part of the films is at the end where everything comes together to tells a story of the nonsense. Between the struggling of the feudal lords and their ideals to gain in whatever way."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I grew up enjoying kungfu and martial arts movies.This one has little new, and none of the awesome spirit of the early kung fu movies.It's too tragic and sad. Too slow and the fights are not very exciting. Really not worth the time. The first half is ok and exciting but the second half is just too slow and not very interesting.Better see Fearless or Fists of Legend or The Magnificent Butcher or any of the other awesome movies again :)"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"Wow, what a great movie. To me this movie is as good as or better than Jet Li's Fearless and what a great movie that was. This movie is a movie with a good message, that sticks in the hart. The martial art, the way the monks protected themselves or fighting a righteous fight was sooooo beautiful and magnificent just as the IP Man movies where. What a beautiful story, not a cliché movie but a story with a surprising ending. I can't understand why this movie is rated 6.7, I rated this movie for the full 10 cause it's worth it!!! I can recommend this to everyone who likes the styles of martial arts and good plots. You will really enjoy this. I did and I cannot get enough of these kind of movies!"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"In SHAOLIN, a fantastic first act with stunning action sequences and compelling drama is drastically offset by an uneven remainder of the film in which cliché plot elements and bad direction painfully take over. Director Benny Chan's story of the destruction of the Shaolin Temple is impressive to watch and easy to appreciate from every technical standpoint, but the narrative falters as it progresses, resulting in muddled and inconsistent pacing - a pity given the big budget and ambitious designs. A great group of performers along with excellent action choreography are complemented by vast production sets and camera-work to create a truly epic feel. An exciting carriage chase and sweeping coverage of Shaolin monks training highlight the superb visual spectacle. While Andy Lau delivers a fine all-around performance as a warlord-turned-monk (a character with a strong and emotional story arc), his costars suffer from what seems like hastily-written characters despite also providing bravura acting. For instance, Nicholas Tse's villainous General Tsao Man becomes much too cartoony with his emo-hairstyle, evil smirks, and stilted dialogue, while Jackie Chan's moments become as forced as Wu Jing is underused. The script sacrifices its focus on narrative strength at times for cliché segments of over-sentimentality, which appear merely to provide stirring nationalism that has become much to prevalent in contemporary Chinese cinema - a crippling and extremely unfortunate hindrance to not only this film but the entire industry itself. Nevertheless, SHAOLIN delivers the goods in terms of action and scope; simply an entertaining film that sadly could have been so much more."
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,The movie is great when it comes to life values. the story line is to redundant. It is used to many times in other Chinese movies. The actors did well. The special effects is good but not great. on a budget of 29 million that was not bad. This morons who did not understand why Andy Lau became a monk did not get the story. They did not understand that the Shaolin is the purest place on the planet. That is why he went there for protection as well as atonement. After he understood the Shaolin way he needed to protect it. Jacki Chan makes a cameo in the movie. He plays a ex monk who can't be pacifistic. He in the end is the one who must continue with the traditions and teach the future monks somewhere else. Budda Bless All of You
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"I just don't understand why this movie didn't get the Oscar ! All the actors acted really good , the story is cool , music they added pretty amazing , BEAUTIFULL DIRECTION ! Emotions , actions , dialogues were best shown in the film if compared to any other martial arts film ! The message of this film is so peaceful !"
新少林寺,Shaolin (2011),,2011,2011.09.09,"A very good, soulful and entertaining film! : smile3:Excellent staging of battles and stunts.Wonderful landscapes and scenery.I would also like to note the good work of the operator and special effects.On the whole, the director did his best.Despite the fact that many people write that Jackie is almost not here, he left a very significant mark in this picture. And this is far from an episode! This is a whole series of episodes, this is power, this is credible humor, this is the whole essence.And the sound has been in my playlist for a long time.The story itself is very exciting. Dynamic, there is drama, tragedy and even a little comedy. It is a pity that it all ended that way! : smile45:"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"In 689 A.D., the Empress Wu Zetian (Carina Lau) is building a 66 m high statue of Buddha for her inauguration as the first empress of China under the objections and conspiracy of the other clans. When the engineer responsible for the construction mysteriously dies with a spontaneous combustion of his body, the superstitious workers are afraid since the man removed the good luck charms from the main pillar. There is an investigation of Pei Donglai (Chao Deng) and another investigator that also dies after withdrawing the amulets.Empress Wu assigns her loyal assistant Shangguan Jing'er (Li Bing Bing) to release the exiled Detective Dee (Andy Lau) from his imprisonment to investigate with Donglai and Jing'er the mystery of the deaths. They ride in a mystic and epic adventure to unravel the mystery. ""Di Renjie"" is a mystic and melodramatic adventure with a magnificent cinematography and wonderful choreography of fights. However, the plot entwines action with moments of soap-opera that might be culturally appreciated by Asian viewers, but absolutely boring and breaking the pace of the first-half of the film. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Detetive D e o Império Celestial"" (""Detective D and the Celestial Empire"")"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Tsui Hark has done quite a few wrongs in recent years- think ""Missing"" and ""The Legend of Zu""- but thankfully ""Detective Dee"" is not one of them. In fact, it is that one right which proves Tsui Hark isn't a has- been, a not-too unreasonable conclusion to draw considering the quality of his recent works. An engrossing historical whodunit in the vein of Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"", Tsui Hark's latest big-budget blockbuster is significant not only because it restores his status as one of the premier Hong Kong film directors, but also because it is game-changing entertainment for the Chinese film industry. For far too long, the expensive Chinese historical epics have revelled in telling tales of war and sacrifice set amidst warring states or feuding emperors jostling for power. Not to say that they aren't any good- John Woo's ""Red Cliff"" and Peter Chan's ""The Warlords"" among some of the best- but their similarities were apparent, and with that came a distinct sense of staleness especially of late. Tsui Hark's entry into this genre however brings a welcome breeze of freshness, deftly combining the elements of an Agatha Christie novel with the aesthetics of a period epic. The mystery to solve is the spontaneous combustion of two high-ranking court officials when exposed to sunlight, these 'murders' taking place in the wake of the coronation of China's first empress in 690 AD. Most have attributed their deaths to superstitious reasons, but our titular hero Detective Dee thinks otherwise. Released from prison by the very empress Wu Zetian (Carina Lau) whose ascendancy he opposed eight years ago, Detective Dee searches instead for rational explanations, believing in science and reason than black magic. Though based on a real-life Tang Dynasty court official, Andy Lau's Detective Dee is more akin to the investigator made popular by a series of novels by Dutch diplomat Robert Van Gulik. Here, he has two uneasy allies- the empress' most trusted servant Jing'er (Li Bingbing) sent to keep an eye on him, as well as albino Supreme Cop officer Pei Donglei (Deng Chao)- both of whom he trusts little of. But that's all right since he can pretty much fight for himself, as evidenced in the numerous action sequences directed by ""Ip Man's"" Sammo Hung. In the spirit of the best mystery thrillers, the real fun comes from trying to piece together the parts of the puzzle before the final reveal. Scripter Zheng Jialu doesn't make it easy, throwing plenty of red herrings this way and that to distract you from guessing the villain. There is divine intervention in the form of a talking deer, facial transfiguration that basically allows one person to assume two personas and exotic creatures such as the fire turtle. Yet Zheng's firm determination to keep the story grounded in reality prevents the film from descending into camp. That same restraint is displayed admirably and wisely by Tsui Hark himself. Sure, there are still his familiar signs of excess- the massive Buddha bronze statue built for the occasion of the coronation; the peculiar characters Detective Dee encounters in an underground city; and even the empress' elaborate coiffure- but these visual touches add colour and sparkle to the fantasy world Tsui has dreamt up for his period mystery without diverting from the intrigue and suspense of the film. Tsui's flourishes are also brought gorgeously to life by rich production design and masterful art direction, matched occasionally by lavish costume design whenever the Empress appears on screen. Sammo's action direction too deserves praise. While the action scenes do not rise to the same great heights as ""Ip Man"", he makes the best out of his main cast of Andy Lau, Li Bingbing, Deng Chao and Tony Leung Kar- Fai. The wire-ful choreography is thrilling enough to set your pulse racing, and two particular action sequences stand out- one set in the underground city between Dee and the Imperial Chaplain and his possum of masked assassins; and the other set in the towering Buddha statue where Dee finally unravels the nefarious plot in a thrilling climax. As the lead character, Andy Lau brings plenty of charisma to the role of Detective Dee. Though the frenzied pace leaves little time for any character development, Andy nails down the titular character with the right amount of wit, intelligence and virtue. When you're not too distracted by what Tsui has placed on her head, Carina Lau will also impress you with her Machiavellian performance as the Empress. On a side note, cinephiles will also cheer the return of Teddy Robin- albeit in a small supporting role- after a long hiatus (preceded actually by last year's Gallants which sadly skipped local cinemas altogether). With a generous dose of mystery, action spectacle and some classic palace intrigue sprinkled with some wit, Tsui Hark's ""Detective Dee"" is sure-fire epic entertainment that rivals Hollywood's ""Sherlock Holmes"". Indeed, if you've enjoyed the former, you're likely to feel likewise for the latter. It is a definite shot in the arm for the period historical epic that China has done to death over the past few years, and for Tsui Hark's floundering fortunes in the past few years. Possibilities for ""Detective Dee"" as a franchise are bright, and this may likely be Tsui's next big franchise a la ""Aces Go Places"" and ""Once Upon A Time in China"""
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"It had been a while since I had seen a Tsui Hark movie. I now feel remiss in not better keeping up with his career.Detective Dee is fantastic! The visuals are stunning. The sweeping, epic scenery and the HUGE set pieces transported me fully into the era of the Tang Dynasty. I was impressed by the CGI, often having trouble distinguishing where the real, physical parts of the set ended and the computer generated world began. The cinematography is superb.The story was complex but still digestible. The filmmakers threw up enough red herrings to keep me guessing while making it believable that Detective Dee could solve the case without huge leaps in logic.I found Andy Lau's performance effective, but was particularly impressed by Carina Lau who played Empress Wu. Her performance was both subtle and powerful. She was mesmerizing anytime she was on screen.As for the fight scenes, well... wow. I mean, really, WOW! The complexity of the final fight between Dee and the person he figures out committed the crime made fight scenes in the Bourne series look like child's play. Seriously. Now, there was wire work - I know some people really dislike that stuff in Kung Fu style movies, but it really worked in this setting. I hope people will give this one a chance. I really thought Detective Dee was fantastic!"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"The general consensus is that director Tsui Hak, after several attempts of dubious success, is back in his usual form. Whether it is top form is subject to debate.Few, if any, would disagree that this movie is an entertainment package that provides you with top-notch cinematic entertainment for two solid hours. Putting the cast aside for a minute, the central set piece is a stunning, towering structure of a Buddha statue overlooking the sprawling imperial city in China more than a thousand years ago. The plot line starts when the construction of this monstrous structure is close to completion, with a mysterious death at the observation terrace (a platform at its eyes), a spontaneous combustion of a senior government official that turns him instantly into a piled of charred bones.While the detective work (not unlike Sherlock Holmes) is the main plot, there is political intrigue in the highest order, the deadly struggle to stop the coronation of the first ever empress in China. For wire-fu action fans, this movie is also completely satisfying. Of particular interest is the protagonist's weapon, given to him by the late emperor, a mace that can detect the weak point in an opponent's weapon, allowing him to break it with a single blow. Photography and special effects (CGI or otherwise) are also world class. Set design and costumes are dazzling.Additional spoiler warning on the material below.Andy Lau is the best choice for Detective Dee, released after 8 years of imprisonment for opposing the rule of a woman, Wu Zetain, who would eventually become emperor. Lau is completely comfortable in projecting the easy, somewhat stoic confidence as well as passionate patriotism of the protagonist.Carina Lau has just matured to a point where she imposes a convincing screen presence that is expected from Empress Wu. What she adds, from her own persona, is a touch of feminine sensitivity that you may not find in many portrayals of Wu that came before, in both cinema and TV.Tony Leung Ka-fai proves again my theory of ""No wasted budget on big names"": when there is a big name in the cast, unless it's an obvious cameo, you know that the apparently non-essential character he plays must have more to it. (Think Ben Kingsley in the recent ""Prince of Persia"" as you know what I mean). Leung's portrayal of the contrast between his character at the beginning and at the end is masterful.Li Bingbing has become the hottest screen icon in China. ""I am not one of those people who simply exploded into fame. I got there slowly,"" she intimates in a recent interview. ""I've never thought about becoming a star. I don't want to be seen and followed with interest"", she adds. She attributes everything to destiny, in which she deeply believes. In this movie, with icy coolness, she plays Wu's protégée, body guard, top aid, plus perhaps more.While the main focus of this movie is entertainment, it does have a historical perspective as Wu, the first empress of China, is among the most controversial historical figures. One thought-provoking question would be that if a depot is capable and the people general benefit, does it really matter if he or she is fiendishly cruel and ruthless? The movie misses a good opportunity to underscore this theme for the audience to ponder over. In the final scene when Dee pleads with the villain not to assassin Wu, the reason he gives is that the method of assassination employed would mean killing a lot of innocent people in the process. The movie would have gone up a notch if, instead, Dee points out that despite Wu's short-comings (including, sigh, being a woman), she is the best ruler they had at the time, and killing her would be doing the entire empire a disservice."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"A super-sized fantasy epic -- and a cracking good mystery story -- from a director who, for this viewer's money, has never completely lost his mojo, despite some box-office and critical misfires in recent years. DETECTIVE DEE carries on the tradition of exhilarating visual craftsmanship that Tsui Hark has demonstrated on many of his pictures over the years, only here it's fronted by a franchise-worthy leading figure in real-life Tang Dynasty forensic detective De Renjie (Andy Lau), and buttressed with Tsui's inimitable visual zest and a smart, politically-tinged and ultimately very satisfying mystery narrative in which senior government officials spontaneously combust from the inside out. As in his best costume fantasies (and even a couple of his not-so-best, such as LEGEND OF ZU), Tsui again conjures some of the most captivating scenery yet seen in a Chinese film, including a 200-foot tall statue-in-progress of Buddha (complete with scaffolding and suspension bridges connected to a central tower) that figures prominently into a spectacular plot to kill the wicked and divisive Empress Wu (Carina Lau), and the underground Phantom Market, a massive, forbidding, fire-lit city of caves wherein a key witness (Richard Ng) resides. Opulent palace interiors have been seen in countless Chinese films and TV series over the years, but feel fresh here -- I don't know if it's simply new sets, new set dressing or new camera angles, but it all feels purpose-built for this production (perhaps it was?). Sammo Hung's choreography is impeccably designed and flawlessly edited, and loaded with the kind of soaring wireworked wuxia you may not realize you sorely missed in Hong Kong/Chinese action movies because so many people have knocked it nearly every time it has been used in the last decade. The film's plentiful CGI is, for the most part, seamlessly integrated, such is the level of technical expertise of contemporary effects houses across Asia, in this case armies of computer jockeys in Korea and Hong Kong (their only weak spot perhaps being an onslaught of battling deer, which are just enough left-of-field to make up for any weaknesses in their rendering). Despite being largely a Mainland production (as far as I know), this has the heart and soul of a classic Hong Kong fantasy, particularly those of it's ace director, albeit one made with much cooler modern filmmaking toys.

狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Di Renjie zhi tongtian diguo or Detective Dee and the mystery of the phantom flame is a Chinese fantasy movie that takes place during the Zhou Dynasty when the first and only Chinese empress Wu Zetian started her reign. The cold, cruel and somewhat megalomaniac woman that wants to rule on her own accord and who killed several potential enemies in the past is now menaced days before her crowning. After the mysterious death of two people during the construction of a giant Buddha statue in front of the emperor's residence, she asks the Chaplain, a sort of state preceptor who speaks through a magical deer, for help. He gives her the advice to recruit the banned Detective Dee who had openly accused the empress for having possibly killed her late husband and who was one of the leading persons in a growing revolution eight years ago. Even before Detective Dee can be contacted, a group of assassins tries to kill him and another prisoner but they ultimately fail. Intrigued by the strange murders and the will to make peace with his past, Detective Dee soon discovers that black magic seems to be the cause of the deaths. Accompanied by the empress' charming but mysterious attendant and an albinistic officer in the penal system, Detective Dee has to put the pieces of the puzzle together before the crowning of the empress takes place and soon discovers a well organized conspiracy with the goal to kill the empress.This movie has a historic background that is though not developed in a profound way. The film rather focuses on fantastic elements around black magic, a few mild suspension moments and a couple of artistic action choreographies done by some of the best experts of several outstanding Hongkong action movies of the late eighties and early nineties. This film though wastes a little bit of potential on here as it turns out to be too diversified to truly convince in any of the genres it touches and as it lacks of a few more developed cultural and historical bits and pieces that would make the final result more authentic.Apart of the action choreographies, a true highlight are definitely the buildings, costumes and masquerades in the movie that were created in a very precise and professional way as it often happens to be in contemporary Chinese movies. On the other side, the special effects are less impressive and often to artificially flavoured so that they destroy the movie's certain kind of magic a few times. That's where Hollywood is still slightly ahead of modern Asian cinema.While the story of this movie definitely has a few good points and a couple of small twists as well, there are still some negative factors. One never really gets to know why the two persons in the beginning of the movie really had to die instead of killing the empress in an unexpected way during her crowning. The movie also has a few anachronisms such as way too modern ships in the harbour and the diplomat in the beginning of the film whose identity and role remains strangely unresolved. These flaws are pardonable if you take this movie as a fictional film only.In the end, you get an entertaining fantasy movie with a solidly suspenseful story, well done choreographies and stunning costumes. The movie though has no truly innovating elements, surprising moments or touching scenes. It has without a doubt a certain kind of magic after all but it is sometimes too professionally done to touch the people. This movie is rather ordinary in comparison to what the gifted director Tsui Hark has done in the past but it's still one of the more entertaining Asian movies from 2010. After all, I guess I would only recommend this film to long time fans of Asian cinema as well as of stunning costumes and artistic choreographies. I would go for a loan instead of an immediate purchase as the film is surely entertaining but nothing outstanding enough to be a worthy addition to a film collection of an Asian cinema maniac."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"This is a visually sumptuous and stunning-looking film by Tsui Hark who has directed or produced some of the classic Hong action films of the last 25 years. The Hark films I've seen, which often have great fight sequences, are hit and miss in terms of the cohesiveness of the stories, though when they work the films can be fabulous (Peking Opera Blues, the Once Upon A Time In China, series, etc.) This period film has an interesting mystery at its heart with lots of red herrings and twists. The story follows Detective Dee as he's brought out of his political imprisonment to investigate a series of murders during the lead-up to the coronation of the first female Emperor. There some plot inconsistencies and problems, but they're small. The lead actors are all very good, including Andy Lau, Bingbing Li, Carina Lau, and Chao Deng. All in all, it's a compelling film not overloaded with action-for-the-sake-of-action that looks at an interesting period in China's history."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I loved many of Tsui Hark's epics from the 80s/90s, but haven't seen anything from the director recently, so I probably went in with fairly neutral expectations.This was an enjoyable ride. Like others have noted, it's comparable to a Chinese ""Sherlock Holmes"" (the recent Guy Ritchie version), or a movie-length, Tang-dynasty-set ""CSI"". Overall, it was a rather original experience - more than I can say for most movies nowadays. There are several intriguing characters and the pace and acting are solid. While the central murder mystery - whodunnit and howdunnit - is not exactly a head-scratcher, it does provide a good structure for some exciting and beautiful visuals.Was the CGI completely up to the director's vision? Definitely not, but to naysayers, I say, loosen up! The budget for this movie is less than that of a typical Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy! I appreciated and enjoyed the whole movie enough that I wasn't overly distracted by the not-so-special effects."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"It's simply an interest week of big budgeted film releases in Singapore, from India's Endhiran starring Superstar Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, to the Asian martial arts film such as the John Woo produced Reign of Assassins, which is getting a special screening today before its release next week. Also, Tsui Hark joins the fray with his latest film Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame, and if you like me, have wondered why Hark has made some astonishing lacklustre films of late, fret not folks, as this film marks the director's return to true class. Like the adage goes, form is temporary while class is permanent, and Detective Dee sounds that trumpet that he's back at his very best with this action adventure.The scale of the film within its first ten minutes will win you over with its grandeur and ambition, and it sustained its stellar delivery at all fronts right up to the finale, keeping the mystery humming at the background, while constantly topping its action fight sequences from the previous. Set in the Tang Dynasty just before the coronation of Chinese history's legendary Empress Wu Zetian (Carina Lau), the mystery involves the self-immolation of court officials with whispers that the supernatural might be involved. All these strange happenings seem to point to a greater conspiracy that to skeptics go back to the Empress in waiting having a hand in them.To show the masses that there is transparency in her governance, she releases on the advice of a wise sage, the Chinese Sherlock Holmes of her time, Detective Dee (Andy Lau) who she had imprisoned for challenging her rule to the throne some eight years ago. Reinstating his stature, she sets him about investigating these deaths, which spells an investigative adventure in a race against time to nab the culprits as well as to discover all hidden agendas that will go against the crowning of the very first female Emperor in China.Tsui Hark, responsible for classics such as Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain in the 80s, the Once Upon a Time in China series in the 90s, have yet to convince me that he had kept up with the times and I was afraid that he may have lost a lot of his clout with the naysayers abhorring his previous offerings like All About Women (seriously) and Missing. Detective Dee will now shut these fellas up (and I will admit, myself included), as we celebrate the helmer's vision and offering for a new audience to acquaint themselves with. The engaging and fantastical storyline by Chen Kuo-fu (also responsible for The Message) got brought to live by a number of Korean special effects teams, that your jaw will literally be wide open when marvelling at the intricate details from miniatures employed, to the money special effects shots.Even then, there's no mistaking that it's also loaded with enough fight action to entertain, thanks to the action direction of Sammo Hung, of late hugely responsible for many action/martial arts flicks that bear his signature, creating unique fighting styles and stances for the characters, utilizing weapons seldom seen in Chinese cinema of late such as the whip, a throwable war-axe and Dee's mace, which comes with a tuning fork of a device that can exploit weakness in metal and lead to the demolition of opposition weapons. You'll have to see it to believe, and that iconic mace forms a sort of Truth object as well, one of the tools Dee utilizes that actually strike fear into the hearts of his enemies.Even with big sets and awesome choreography, the cast was an eclectic mix of veterans and up and coming actors. Carina Lau marks that rare appearance as the ruthless and cold Empress Wu, while Andy Lau shows commanding his presence is thanks to that charisma of his as the titular detective, and you'll probably welcome the small cameo appearances by Teddy Robin and Richard Ng. Deng Chao shines in his role as the pale faced investigator Pei Donglai who starts off a really nasty cop with a nasty attitude, while Li Bingbing's Shangguan Jing'er is that loyal, dutiful servant of the Empress assigned to keep an eye on and report on Dee's investigations, and together they sort of form the Watsons to Dee's Sherlock, even though the trust levels between them aren't chummy, and takes quite a while for rapport to be built.Sure it doesn't take rocket science to figure out who the chief culprit is in the story, but it's never always about the destination, but the experience in getting there. Detective Dee scores at all fronts with its excellent production values that you'd only experience in a Hollywood production, but Tsui Hark has through this one film demonstrated that Asian filmmakers can reach the same heights, or even surpass it, in terms of storyline, character development, and to top it all off with some eye popping and astoundingly detailed special effects used to create worlds that are of a bygone era. Highly recommended, and a contender to go into my shortlist of the best this year!"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"There's some very good things to say about this film. Great set pieces, wonderful camera work and some very good actors. Colourful, historic and epic in its aims, with some great but not overly violent martial artistry.Yet for all that it ticks off on the list, it's just not very engrossing.The detective story is a bit convoluted and tries to marry magic, superstition, rationalism and surprise. Yet, it gets all a little too confusing and not something you can accept. I agree that you have to suspend disbelief, but you are meant to be figuring out the mystery and you just lose interest when some of the revelations are made. Some of it is clever but too left-field to admire.This is just a disappointment. I just couldn't get into this, I watched to the end and was left just underwhelmed. As said, I liked a number of things about this film, yet the sum of its parts is definitely not less than the whole."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"After watching this, I ran to IMDb to see just how much the American distributor had cut out of it. For some reason, many American distributors who buy up martial arts movies think that story doesn't really matter, so they should be able to cut all of it out. Well, if there were cuts, IMDb doesn't know about them. It lists just the one runtime of 119 minutes. So how is this movie so incoherent? Apparently that's just how it is. Andy Lau plays an inspector in mytho-historical China who has been imprisoned since he challenged the ascension of the new Empress (Carina Lau, who, back in the day, starred in many Wong Kar-Wai films). After a mysterious crime which resulted in several people spontaneously combusting, the Empress recruits Lau to investigate, teamed with an albino, Chao Deng, and the Empress' personal guard, Bingbing Li. Deng and Li have their own loyalties. So, okay, the story up to here is followable, even if there is a completely unexplained talking deer (they'll deal with it later). Then it just goes nuts. At first, this is amusing. I'm all for nuts. At one point they have to go find a guy named Donkey Wang, which is awesome. Then... a whole bunch of incomprehensible crap happens, and the film completely lost me. The story seems cut to pieces, but even worse is the way the action sequences are edited. I had no idea what the heck was going on. Eventually, I got so bored I nodded off (not before Andy Lau beat up a couple of CGI deer, which was certainly worth seeing). The whole thing seemed like a huge mess to me."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Andy Lau stars as Detective Dee, a disgraced detective who was against the dowager Empress taking the throne. Thrown into jail for 8 years for his disapproval, he is called back to the capital on the eve of the the Empress taking official power because it seems that people are suddenly bursting into flames.Grand spectacle of the sort that is only possible with computer generated imagery this is a film that works for most of its running time. Sure it's big and clunky like a grand summer epic here in America, but the plot is such that you get pulled into it, the action is simply amazing to the point you can't stop watching, and the characters are intriguing enough that you can't stop caring. Its a grand epic that Hollywood should be ashamed they didn't produce.Mark this as two in a row for the up and down Tsui Hark. Certainly this is a radical departure from his last film, the romantic comedy All About Women. It's also a departure from his recent blockbusters like The Blade (which some people love and I file dull, to the point a Korean spy spoof that sent it up crashed in burned for me) Seven Swords (a three hour epic snooze fest based on the Seven Samurai that was cut down from an even longer cut) or even his semi-recent Zu sequel (which was incoherent). Where his recent epics crashed and burned for this was simply a story that took me to another time and place. Certainly the world it creates is full of computer generated imagery, but it really doesn't matter since it's so high in the gee whiz factor.While I wouldn't put this on my list of the best films of the year, the film kind of disappoints in the final half hour (it's a bit too much like a typical mystery and a tad too clear cut) it is one that was totally enjoyable and one I can recommend pretty much without reservation. Its also a film that I will happily see on a big screen if this gets some US screenings.This is one to watch for."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"SPOILERS - sorry I cannot review this without leaking major spoilers. You've been forewarned! I liked the film, but not enough to say I'd watch it over and over again. People here are giving it 8, 9, or 10 out of 10. I could only muster a 6.5 The directing is very good. Tsui Hark does a good job of moving the camera around, focusing on the action and the actors. The actors as a whole do a good job. Andy Lau does well as do all his costars. Worth noting is the performance by Carina Lau, both menacing, and authoritative as an empress struggling to retain her throne.But for me it's the storyline that fails this otherwise decent film. It's a detective story and there should be plot twists and turns. But here the obvious culprit is let off the hook for no real reason other than he knows the famed Detective Dee. The mystery part of it fails for me and in a mystery movie, that's pretty important.6.5/10"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I'm sorry, but I really don't get on with the films of Tsui Hark. I see them as an example of style over substance, and try as I might to enjoy them, it rarely happens. Hark's style is something I'm not a fan of: he makes superficial, speedy-paced movies that look great but lack depth and substance. DETECTIVE DEE, a film about a detective investigating bizarre cases of spontaneous human combustion in ancient China, is a case in point.The film does have some good points. A Chinese murder mystery/action adventure is a new one on me, and there's a kind of fresh and inventive spin to it that keeps you watching. The visuals, despite being created by some sometimes cheesy CGI, are admittedly impressive, with the Buddhist version of the Statue of Liberty looming large in the story. The cast is also strong.But something's missing, and that's the viewer's involvement in the storyline. I never felt engaged or caught up in what was going on, and the eventual solving of the mystery was nothing but a silly disappointment. Indeed, the film descends into silliness on more than one occasion; don't go looking for realism, whatever you do. Watching this, I'm reminded of why I don't get on with Hong Kong's lavish, wirework-infused costume fantasies of the 1990s. Give me down-to-earth realism any day.Despite headlining the cast, Andy Lau feels missing in action for much of this film. Viewers are led through the mystery by his detective, but we never learn much about him and characterisation is nil. The albino warrior, played by Chao Deng, is a much more interesting character, as is Tony Leung Ka Fei's master builder. The female roles also feel a bit underwritten to me. Sammo's listed as action director, but the action is brief and doesn't make any impact whatsoever. It's certainly not the finest hour for anyone involved."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Call me crazy,but I like the hyperactive direction of Tsui Hark. For some reason for this movie he has calmed down considerably. Is this a good thing?Well,judging from some reviewers it is. To me personally it is quite the opposite. Not once did I felt the joy as his older movies did provide. The movie takes itself too seriously. Of course this is done to enhance the mystery. Except that the ultimate mystery isn't that compelling to start with. And partly this is because of the fantasy elements that are used to explain certain things. The movie itself is entertaining enough but far from what one would expect. Especially when this movie lends itself to do the crazy stuff we are used to from Hark."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Hark Hsui is one of the most prestigious living HK director, his unconstrained imagination and the possess of a virtual martial world establishes his world-famously unique style in the world. Detective Dee is his newest opus which is also a genuinely ambitious one, the big budget and costly cast seem to manifest that it is a venturous gamble, as his several previous films MISSING (2008), ALL ABOUT WOMEN (2008) and THE SEVEN SWORDS (2005)) all failed severely in the domestic box office.As an admirer of his oeuvre, it's a great relief and I'm even somewhat surprised to find out that the film excels itself in the visual concussion, the cloud-kissing Empress statue and phantom bazaar are the steady proof of the top-notch mastery of CGI in a Chinese film.By the contrast the script cannot be complacent, the well-drafted manoeuvre fail to convey certain convincing narrative, the dialogues are bland and the emotional link is sometimes even out of context. Anyway, as a detective story, the twist-and-turn is moderately predictable but a safe play as well, which I could appreciate it for a no-pee-moment 120 minutes. In view of a crowded market of period films aiming at ancient China, the status quo is a bit disappointing because aesthetic fatigue makes audience pickier and pickier, plus a heavier budget could really hurt the investors, the current trend is unhealthy for the booming market, I am looking forward to expecting a more kaleidoscopic hotchpotch in Chinese cinematic region."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I saw it and to me this isn't a Judge Dee story. It is a Kung Fu movie and not a great one at that. I'm sorry - if I want to see Kung Fu characters flying through the air on wires and doing physically impossible feats in a world of myth and magic then I'll look for it. What I wanted was a good Judge Dee story - a logical and intelligent deductive reasoning detective story set in a rich and fascinating Tang Dynasty world.I am a great fan of Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee books. I had just read ""The Phantom of the Temple"" a few days before seeing this movie. What I had expected was a movie with a story line set in the world of Judge Dee and keeping in harmony with that world. They are intelligent whodunnits without an overbearing supernatural element. The TV movie ""Judge Dee and the Monastery Murders"" that was taken from ""The Haunted Monastery"" was quite enjoyable.Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame was a great disappointment. The story by Lin Qianyu was just not up to snuff. Unfortunately, so was the action. I've seen as good in TV shows like Andromeda."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Detective Dee is a real fun and solid movie with breath-taking cinematography from Tsui Hark, a pretty legendary filmmaker from Hong Kong.It's is a bizarre martial arts fantasy mystery film (yes). The story is both taken from historical China and derived from a novel series (series, so look for sequels). It's a frequently zany mystery with tons of twists that might have your head spinning...or you might just be completely lost. Go with that feeling and expect it.The story follows Detective Dee (Andy Lau) as he's brought out of imprisonment to investigate a series of murders during the lead-up to the coronation of the first female Empress of China (played by Carina Lau). The movie feels almost like a flurry of ridiculous events, which is pretty great and really different from anything that's coming out of Hollywood these days. To enjoy this movie, go in with an open mind and remember...it's in subtitles."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Tsui Hark best film in years It's been a long time coming, but finally, Tsui Hark delivers. It is a moment for cause and celebrate. Perhaps that going a bit over board, because despite the last decade of eccentric films that Hark have delivers, at the back of our minds, we knew the little master still got tricks left in his box. Lucky for us, the wait is over. Detective Dee is probably what you call, the most ambitious, interesting, entertaining blockbuster film of the year. The effects are a joy to watch and does not pale in comparison to its Hollywood counterparts. The story is complicated and unpredictable on a few levels and certainly enough to glue our eyes to the screen. Adding to the mix, Hark also gave us, everyone's favorite in Andy Lau. What can possibility go wrong and luckily it doesn't.What I really enjoyed about this film is the creativity, the differences and the ambition that contains Tsui Hark all over it. Sure it requires the likable screen presence of Andy Lau to carry the film and he does so, with the same kind of elegance as always. Along with the experienced veteran in Carina Lau as the Empress in waiting and Tony Leung Kar Fai as the lead builder. Both performed with the sort of flair that adds to the film. Perhaps the weak link of the mix remains Li Bing Bing. Although I have personally bias towards this Bing Bing, as I do not seem to be able to picture her as pretty at all. Her performance is weak and her acting remains rather forced than acting. Then again, asking her to be as pretty as Fan Bing Bing is stretching the eye candy factor a bridge too far.All in all, Detective Dee easily one of the best film of 2010. It is by far, Mr. Hark best work in more than a decade. It is a shame that it took this long for the little master to shine once again. For long time HK Cinema fans, Detective Dee is the film that we are all waiting for. For me, Dee is a film that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. A must see(Neo 2010) I rate it 9/10www.thehkneo.com"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"a few years after the huge success of tiger and dragon such a flood of ""historical"" Chinese movies followed that i stopped watching after House of Flying Daggers and Hero. Somehow i decided to watch Detective Dee nevertheless and must say i do not regret this. it is quite an achievement in visuals, acting and story. watching the improvement of CGI one can only compare it to the bunch of mega-million Hollywood movies and see how shallow they usually are.this movie has actually an intriguing storyline and i liked the quality of the production; it has some, i'd say - quirks, but they should be related to the fact that the movie was created by a different culture than Europeans, so we can't understand completely all the movie has to say and how it says it.still - worth seeing!; congratulations to the makers of the movie"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"It's 689 A.D. China. Wu Zetian is set to be crowned as the first female empress. She faces great opposition ready to overthrow her. A towering Buddha is under construction for her inauguration. During a tour with a foreign ambassador, an official spontaneously combust. Officer Pei Donglai goes to investigate and his superior is killed. Shangguan Jing'er is the Empress' attendant. Dee is released from prison and reinstated as the Imperial Commissioner to solve Phantom Flame Case.I started out much more invested in the mystery. The movie sets up a great Sherlock mystery to solve. Then it overflows with wild fight spectacular. It's imaginative fun but the mystery gets muddled. It does some bizarre acupuncture plastic surgery and hallucinatory bucks. It's so wild that the movie loses its meaning for me. I just lose my way in this funhouse martial arts movie."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"The sources of seduction are more than familiar- somptuos cinematography, impressive fight scenes, good performances. The mix of mystery and history and fight scenes, policy and heroism, love and loyalty works in lovely manner. But the film has another basic virtue - the flaws. In many cases, they are a sin. In this case , they are just support for the nuances of a beautiful story, special not only for exoticism but for the inspired way to give a fascinating story about moral dilemmas in the skin of a policier."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Even if I were to accept the ludicrous ending which offered some obscure bugs as the culprits of the spontaneous combustion of Tang officials, there were still so many plot holes to ignore. In addition, the martial arts sequence was blurry, too-close up to take seriously. We know the actors aren't pugilistic experts and it showed. What they should have done was employ long angle shots to convey a sense of majesty and beauty in the martial arts, but of course they couldn't because the actors were just not as skilled. And the CGI was just so fake. Especially that of Chang'an, the capital city of ancient Tang Dynasty, and the statue of Buddha. Coupled with the lengthy story-line that was so boring, this film is a must avoid-at-all-cost. Consider yourself warned."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Not Andy Lau, but the director Tsui Hark!!! Now, I've heard others say it is close to the earlier CGI Sherlock with Downey Jr. but I haven't seen it(yet) so I can't compare.On itself, and compare to 7 Swords, this movie is extravagant, with set pieces after set pieces. Story though, not much, but a lot of smoke and mirrors. The usual looking and talking tough, some romance (that's the thing about HK movies - they MUST have a romance line) **spoiler** and the way the girl died was kind of cheap (screen time and thought into the process of it). Rain of Assassin much better on this respect.Still visually very worth the price of admission."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I never heard of Detective Dee but saw a trailer for this film so I gave it a shot. It's a visually impressive movie and not just for the martial arts. There's an expansive view of a Chinese harbor for example, that's simply gorgeous, and the picture offers some exceptional stunts and clever wirework. The story line even has Detective Dee (Andy Lau) investigating cases of spontaneous human combustion, something I don't think I've seen outside of an X-Files episode. Various ideas are offered for the corpses consumed by fire, ultimately settling on death by fire beetles. There really are such things as fire beetles, but their name is derived from the fact that they are bioluminescent, similar to lightning bugs but without the flashing feature.I read a handful of reviews and was puzzled by the number of comments that said the story was confusing and a mess. Seemed pretty straightforward to me, so I guess paying attention helps. The talking deer for example, was the result of Shangguan Jing'er's (Bingbing Li, great name!) ventriloquism and not something mystical. Speaking of deer, the martial arts aspect of those battling Detective Dee was an inventive gimmick even if the film makers went over the top with the idea.I'm usually let down by most modern day martial arts flicks because they mostly follow a similar formula and try to outdo each other with the special effect fight scenes, but this one had the kind of craziness I haven't seen before. So I might be looking into some more Detective Dee stuff down the road. Hard to top this one though."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Eight years ago, Detective Dee (Andy Lau) and compatriot Shatuo (Tony Leung Ka-fai), among others, opposed the queen regent (Carina Lau) in her bid to become the first female Emperor of China; for their treason, Detective Dee was imprisoned and Shatuo lost a hand. Now it is eight years later and the regent is poised to fully become the Emperor, but her coronation is imperiled by mysterious deaths that occur inside the 66-storey high statue of Buddha that is being constructed in honour of the coronation. Not one, but two functionaries seemingly spontaneously combust, and there seems to be no explanation for this. After consulting the Chaplain (in the person of a deer), the Emperor-to-be decides to free Detective Dee to solve this crime before her coronation; not to be naive, she also assigns Shanguan Jing'er (Bingbing Li), her favourite female warrior, and Pei Donglai (Chao Deng), an albino warrior, to shadow and help Detective Dee, perhaps to his own peril. Meanwhile, Shatuo has become the architect and supervisor of the building of the Buddha, and only he knows the secret of the fire turtles....There's a bit of everything in ""Detective Dee,"" including mystery, romance, fighting, martial arts, intrigue and, perhaps, a touch or more of the supernatural. To be honest, it doesn't bear serious scrutiny in terms of logic or loopholes, but that's not why one watches a film like this anyway – this is the kind of movie where the audience should just go along for the ride. And a wild ride it is too. I'm still not entirely certain what happened in the end, but it hardly matters; it was enough just to watch the various goings-on and admire the scenery and the fighting."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"In Seventh Century China preparations are being made for the coronation of Wu Zetian, who will be China's first Empress. These preparations include the construction of a huge Buddha. As the construction is being examined the man leading the inspection suddenly bursts into flames. An investigation starts immediately and not long afterwards the lead investigator dies in the same manner. His deputy, Pei Donglai, initially takes over the investigation but soon the Empress puts Di Renjie (Detective Dee) in charge on the recommendation of the Imperial Abbot despite the fact that Di is in prison for taking part in a revolt. To ensure his loyalty she sends her attendant, an attractive woman named Shangguan Jing'er, to work with him. Soon Di, Jing'er and Pei are working together to figure out how the killings were committed and find the killer before the coronation takes place.This Chinese film features a good central mystery and plenty of great action. Of course to enjoy the action you have to accept its fantastical nature as characters do amazing leaps and spins during fights. There is also fantasy elements involving the use of mythical 'fire beetles' and acupuncture techniques to change characters' appearances. There are some good twists along the way and the identity of the killer is far from obvious without being unbelievable when finally revealed. There are also surprising character deaths. As one would expect from a big budget Chinese film the sets and costumes are sumptuous and the action is stylish. The cast does a fine job; notably Andy Lau, as Di; Bingbing Li, as Jing'er and Chao Deng as Pei. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of Chinese historical action films even though it is a bit confused at times it is a lot of fun."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Detective Dee is an enjoyable romp without much substance, kind of like that cheerleader you dated back in high school with the great looks and bubbly personality but nothing whatsoever important to say. Director Hark Tsui's film does a commendable job creating a period piece that puts the viewer in the middle of the Tang dynasty when China's empire rivaled that of Ancient Rome. The visuals are stunning and the towering Empress Wu statue adds a mystical aura to the film despite the small special effects budget.The mystery plot however is not fully developed with too many leaps in logic and petty motives to please most fans of the genre and the action sequences fail to add any new twists, just more unbelievable ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" wire tricks that seem out of place in the historical setting.I'm sure this movie would have been more enjoyable in Mandarin - the English voice-over dialog was stilted and shallow and strangely enough the subtitles varied considerably from the voice-over so ""fire beetles"" becomes ""fire turtles"" in the voice-over. Perhaps the word for ""beetle"" is ""turtle"" in Chinese but I was personally disappointed to see that the vicious flaming snapping turtles I had visualized turned out to be harmless-looking creepy crawlers!"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"As far as wire trick movies go... this was actually rather good in my opinion. I really enjoyed the action scenes, the maneuvers seemed rather plausible and life like, no major glitches or hang ups, and for once you couldn't see the wires (big yay there!) As for the story plot.... neh not that real impressed, I got hung up a lot with story line, about surviving the shot through the chest... with the fire beetles, with the fight scenes that defy gravity and all that.Characters were interesting... Not sure what to make of the acupuncture/transformation bit. Kind of weirded me out, although it wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen.As for the name... I think its rather lame and/or something got lost in the translations.Over all this was an interesting movie, though I'm not sure I'd watch it again."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"""Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame"" is an entertaining movie that couldn't be mistaken for anything else but what it is: a Hark Tsui's movie.Detective Dee, an all-charm Andy Lau, has been in prison for 8 years because he opposed the wife of the deceased Emperor and her growing power. But after some mysterious killings happen just before she is to become Regent Empress, he is called back to help.And little more. The plot is just empty air. You have some betrayals, some mysterious deaths, some investigation done by detective Dee, but really, the plot is little less than an excuse. There is almost zero detective work and little tension.What it lacks in plot or character development (it doesn't help that everyone is overacting, something typical on the other hand in this type of movies), it more than makes up for in flashy set ups, nice fights and colorful environments (even if the CGI work can be... well, lacking). Tsui Hark knows how to make everything look amazing and the atmosphere is just great, and all the set ups are really cool (as the underground city). It all looks so good that it ends up leaving the viewer with a feeling of a wasted opportunity. Tsui Hark doesn't care much for pace or plot, more about set ups, pieces and fights. The movie could have been much better if it was more balanced. As it is, it is an enjoyable time in front of the screen, but don't go expecting much more."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I decided to watch this movie after seeing a trailer on youtube that made it look absolutely mind blowing, an incredible, overwhelming spectacle with incredible action; it basically looked like something that could rival Yimou Zhang's brilliant Hero. It's one hell of a trailer, and at times the movie comes close to living up to it.It takes a while for the movie to get going though. Sure, it's epic (although some of the special effects look a little too computer- generated, something I would think would be even more problematic on the big screen instead of my TV), but the pacing feels a little sluggish. It also turns out to be sillier than the trailer, as I realized when a talking deer started advising the Empress. The movie is rather odd in this way, offering magical touches but not really creating a consistently magical world.The first scene that really matched the trailer involves a naked woman and a remarkable number of arrows, and it totally awesome. In general, the action scenes are pretty cool.The story is decidedly convoluted and not everything in it makes narrative sense. But it comes close enough to making sense that the action keeps you from worrying too much about it.So no, it's not another Hero, but it has moments that come close. And while I would rather see the movie the guy who edited the trailer had in his head over the movie I actually got, the movie as it exists is really fun."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"""Men have weak points, just like weapons. They will also break when struck."" Wu Zetian wants to become China's first Supreme Empress. While the stage and Buddah is being constructed for the inauguration strange things begin to happen. First Master Jia spontaneously com-busts, followed by more people bursting into flames. The empress wants this mystery solved before she takes over and there is only one person she can think of to solve it, Detective Dee (Lau) a prisoner in jail for treason. Can he put aside his feelings and solve the mystery of the phantom flame in time? This is not usually the type of genre I get into, but I did enjoy this movie. The tag-line says ""Crouching Tiger meets Sherlock Holmes"", it's hard to disagree with that statement. I will add that I think this is a type of modern Kurosawa film. The feel and the plot are something that he would do, and the ending very much reminds me of his style in the way that you aren't really sure if the ending is good or bad for those involved and makes you think. Overall, again this is not normally my type of movie but I did very much enjoy it. Good story and action. I give it a B+."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Some compare this movie to a Chinese take on the new Sherlock Holmes, a seemingly paranormal, period mystery explained over the course of two hours with more than its share of action along the way. All of those similarities may be true, but Detective Dee attempts to bite off more than two hours can chew. It suffers from abrupt scene transitions, almost completely absent character development, and extremely short fight scenes that I can't imagine would satisfy anyone watching for the kung fu. Not that those scenes seemed to serve any purpose to begin with, most of the reasons for the grand kung fu battles seem to be contrived because it's a movie about old China, of course they do kung fu. The worst sin this movie commits, however, is its plot, which grows increasingly preposterous as the movie continues. By the time the movie had run its length, I had gone from pleasantly acquiescent to a few strains on my suspension of disbelief, to rolling my eyes at a movie that's no more plausible than the recent GI Joe. I won't take it away from the film that it was very imaginative and more than willing to be original, while surprising the audience in ways that didn't seem *too* outlandish. All in all, it's the sort of movie I'd like to have on in the background - if I could speak Chinese."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,Visually beautiful and very stylish but overall a little boring.I expected more considering who is involved with it.
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"The Emperor is dead and next in line to replace him is a woman. Never in the history of China has there been an Empress. As her coronation draws closer, loyalties are tested, schemes are rumored, and when people start to literally burst into flames, the stakes can be no higher for all involved. This is the set up for an in-depth mystery with a side of kung fu action.In late 7th century China, thousands of laborers are working under pressure to complete an immensely tall tower in the shape of the Buddha in time for the Empress's coronation. There are rumors that her predecessor did not die of natural causes and there are rebel armies in the countryside eager to invade and prevent her from taking power. While on an inspection tour of the tower, the chief architect suddenly bursts into flames and burns to death in a matter of seconds. While investigating this occurrence, the chief investigator then bursts into flames as well. Is this divine intervention for tampering with magic amulets or is something more sinister afoot? The man put on the case is Detective Dee (Andy Lau from House of Flying Daggers). He has been imprisoned for the past eight years for opposing the Empress's (Carina Lau from 2046) rise to regent; however, it is she who releases him to find the culprits because the realm's Imperial Chaplain says it must be so. Joining his investigative team are a trusted aide to the Empress who is to keep tabs on him, Jing'er (Bingbing Li from Snow Flower and the Secret Fan & the Forbidden Kingdom), and an albino detective, Pei Donglai (Chao Deng). Very few people want to see Detective Dee succeed and find the plot's mastermind. He continuously dodges assassination attempts, interrogates hostile witnesses, and must face off against some paranormal forces which appear to be involved.The Detective Dee character is based on the Chinese folk hero Di Renjie who remains a popular figure from China's Tang Dynasty who ruled from the 7th to 10th centuries. He is wise not only in the ways of following leads in a case but in the politics behind the case itself. He recognizes and easily dissects the true motivations behind why he was chosen to investigate these matters and can see two steps down the road just as easily as he can hear an assassin's arrow flying through the air.The downfall of this film is its ridiculous use of CGI. No attempt was made to make any backgrounds or scenery look real, wide shots of the city are cringe inducing, and you can almost make out the individual pixels which comprise the Buddha tower. When focused on the mystery and when the characters are discussing methods and possible perpetrators, the script is engaging and the film is at its best. However, when characters stop to talk about the past or their feelings, it usually takes a nose dive and makes you wait to just get those scenes out of the way.Compared to its obvious cousins of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero, and the House of Flying Daggers, Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame is way at the bottom of the list. The action sequences are not as eye-popping, the dialogue is stunted, and any hint of true emotion is as fake as the film's CGI. Stay away from Detective Dee."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"To me, Zhang Yimou's HERO was a watershed moment: a masterful film, which features CGI. Since then, films in the ""swordsman"" genre, made by many of the masters of Hong Kong and Mainland cinema (Zhang, Chen Kaige, John Woo, and Tsui Hark) have increasingly, and detrimentally, relied on CGI. The ensuing films have been visually spectacular (HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER, THE PROMISE, RED CLIFF, THE PROMISE, and ZU WARRIORS, to name a few), but as films they were all somewhat lacking. It began to be my fervent wish that all of these estimable directors be given drastically reduced budgets and blue screens, and get back to the business of making great movies.DETECTIVE DEE etc has much going for it. Andy Lau Tak-Wah and Tony Leung Ka Fai are given able support from Li Bingbing, Carina Lau, and Chao Deng; Sammo Hung's fight choreography was stellar; the plot was convoluted; the anachronisms are what Giants' closer Brain Wilson would call ""delicious""; and the CGI didn't get too much in the way;. All very well. It just seemed to go on for a very long time, and lacked the frenetic pacing of the ""swordsman"" films of the '90's."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"Tsui Harks Detective Dee is like a Chinese Sherlock Holmes whodunit thriller with supernatural elements, classical wu xia and historical epicness.And, it entertains perfectly.Excellent camera work,epic landscapes and stunning set designs,costumes, atmosphere, soundtrack - top notch.Some cheesy or absurd scenes, like the Roman who speaks spanish, acupucture shapeshifters, spontaneous combustion or an armada of arrows and none hits its targets, but that doesn't undermine the great fun, entertainment and spectacle this movie is.Detective Dee is an excellent escapism from the usual.Highly recommended."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"The is the first Hark Tsui film I've seen (but not the first Chinese film). It's a great film - with a Harry Potter title.The mix of reality and fantasy is just right. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, and the special effects are visually stunning.(The story gives a plausible explanation for spontaneous human combustion.) Tony Leung gets first billing in the credits, but he's really the #2 (or #3) character in the story. Detective Dee is masterfully played by Andy Lau. All the actors and actresses give first-rate performances.The story is set around the real-life Empress Wu, just before she ascends the throne. (I have to wonder why anybody would want to be Empress - you have to wear those funny hats.) Despite the name, Carina Lau (Empress Wu) is married to Tony Leung.I hope someone who speaks Cantonese (or is it Mandarin?) can comment on the subtitles. ""Chaplain"", for instance, doesn't seem right."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"The first film in the saga has its greatest strength in history and does not blind us with incredible visual effects. Being the third film (but first in its production), it is the end point of the story. We have a protagonist with superhuman abilities: encyclopedic knowledge about any discipline, superhuman memory, fighting skills worthy of a demigod, and a problematic story with the protagonist empress. It is difficult to feel sympathy with the latter character, but it must be recognized that within Eastern culture it is very difficult to find some monarch worthy of recognition. Before the opening of a gigantic Buddha statue we see the appearance of an ambassador who speaks Spanish (when at that time the language as such did not exist), and then people mysteriously begin to suffer from spontaneous combustion. An intrigue against the empress catalyzes a final showdown has nothing to envy of the best films in the West. A huge film, which deserves multiple prequels to continue feeding our astonishment."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"When it comes to this particular movie franchise, I viewed the 2013 prequel Young Detective Dee first, after being wowed by the unanimous praise showered upon it. Although the action sequences were very well accomplished and the special effects were above par, the focus on these listed aspects appeared to sacrifice characterization and mystery, a flaw that the original, Detective Dee, does not suffer from.It's 689 A.D., and Empress Wu (Carina Lau) is set to be coronated, and though a series of mysterious deaths, which involve internal combustion, are striking fear throughout the land, she is adamant that nothing affect her ceremony. Contemporary investigative methods will inevitably fail to achieve results, and so, she calls upon the assistance of Dee (Andy Lau), a brilliant detective she had jailed for treasonous offenses. Although the Empress has faith in Dee's abilities to bring order in this time of chaos, she doesn't trust him, appointing her right hand woman Jing'er (Li Bingbing) to assist, while penal officer Pei (Deng Chao) accompanies them in their quest for answers.Mr. Lau is fantastic in the role of Dee, appearing as equally likable as he is intellectually and physically competent, vying for truth and justice, while the always attractive Ms. Bingbing's depiction of Jing'er is as comparatively confident and adept in her abilities as the male lead. Ms. Lau's interpretation of the Empress proves to be frighteningly cold, though at the same time she is capable of feeling a variety of warmer emotions.Unlike the prequel, which seemed to contain one action scene after another, Detective Dee has an equal focus on plot, which not only develops the characters and makes us genuinely care for their well-being, but the world in which they inhabit. Also unlike the prequel, the lead antagonists behind the plot are shrouded in mystery until the end, this tactic entrenching the viewer in a suspenseful action packed thrill ride that never ceases to keep the viewer's interest.The acrobatic fight scenes are a joy to watch, their flawless execution being as mesmerizing as they are brilliant, many of the scenes not only looking fresh and unique, but feeling so as well. The special effects are a visual treat for the eyes, and where the prequel seemed to become infatuated with drowning the viewer in such beauty, Detective Dee appears to provide an equal blend of live action and computer generated scenes which compliment the material.A very intelligent, gripping and entertaining action mystery, which is as sublimely magical as it is dark and poignant, Detective Dee is a fantastic movie that not only doesn't compromise the quintessential Chinese features often present in similar action films, but proves to be just as immersive as American features of the same genre, if not even more so."
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"producer and director, the script keeps you until the end. It's all about history, real facts of Chinese story and adapted in a fantastic manner. The fights are there we do not get bored with the best famous actors at the moments. It's difficult to predict the end. The movie is made with talented touch, it's not an American style movie. Chinese art at his top with great actor, good moment to spend in cinema. Now we are thinking, what is everything was really like this ? The final is not usual and it keeps on on good mind. We hope to have more movie like this, it's refreshing and good. Incredible statue of budha representing the extreme acts of this time of the history. So what next Mr Tsui?"
狄仁杰之通天帝国,Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010),,2010,2011.09.02,"I got a kick out of or from this film, and it's definitely better than a lot of what plays in movie cinemas. I looked at the movie listing for a local cinema that shows 9 movies every week, if not every day, some months ago. Not a single 1 of the 9 had/has any favorable reviews on the WWW; not among reviews I checked anyway. So, of course I didn't go. When paying around $9 to see a film, then it better be good.I will add a little commentary about the closing paragraph of the review posted by Harry T. Yung from Hong Kong.Quote: ""While the main focus of this movie is entertainment, it does have a historical perspective as Wu, the first empress of China, is among the most controversial historical figures. One thought-provoking question would be that if a depot is capable and the people general benefit, does it really matter if he or she is fiendishly cruel and ruthless? The movie misses a good opportunity to underscore this theme for the audience to ponder over. In the final scene when Dee pleads with the villain not to assassin Wu, the reason he gives is that the method of assassination employed would mean killing a lot of innocent people in the process. The movie would have gone up a notch if, instead, Dee points out that despite Wu's short-comings (including, sigh, being a woman), she is the best ruler they had at the time, and killing her would be doing the entire empire a disservice."" 1) ""Wu's short-comings (including, sigh, being a woman)""? Ugh. Ya gotta be kidding. Why is being a woman a short-coming? 2) What's the real history related to this film's story? What's factually based about the empress and the detective, plus the character who wanted to assassinate the empress? (Of course I know that the CGI and wires stuff didn't exist in the true history.) This isn't a discussion forum, so the questions are rhetorical. If someone posted answers, then there's no way to be notified about this, so the questions unfortunately remain of rhetorical genre."

让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"This movie is really funny and brutal at the same time. Which is a hard thing to balance. Violence is ""real"" (with consequences for the characters involved that is), but the humor still works. Two factors play into that in my estimation: The script and the really good actors playing in this.Mixture works and the CGI effects are really good too. Then you also have some wonderful dialogue between the main characters that is so rich, the translation might not do it entire justice (watched it with subtitles on and was hard to follow from time to time). But it's apparent how much fun they had shooting this movie. If you like eastern movies, I do not need to convince you to watch this. But maybe this can be your entry into a whole new (fascinating) world for you ..."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I'm shock no one talked about the political satire and representation towards Mao, this was the whole point of this film, Jiang Wen grew up in Beijing, with a military family background and he is best at the discrete and obscure political representation in his films. The character Jiang Wen plays is a distortion of Mao, and his sidekicks are the political friends Mao had, just watch this film with this information in mind, you'll get what this is truly about. At the end, the protagonist is betrayed, he left alone, but still pursuing his dreams. A tragic ending just like Mao's. Btw, Jiang Wen is a big fan of Mao if that wasn't clear."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"There are so many funny metaphors but you do need to be somewhat acquainted with Chinese to understand them. I think this will be a difficult film for non-Chinese to grasp, especially with a lot of deadpan satire and dark humor. It is extremely funny in a way, especially the scene between Jiang Wen and Carina Lau where she displayed a series of objects to him in bed. You won't ""get it"" if you don't understand Chinese proverbs and surreptitious meaning. So I'm not surprised if this movie will be rated exceptionally intelligent to its Chinese audience but will appear to many as silly, improbable and illogical."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"With the current election fever brewing in Singapore, one can't help but to view this through a tinted prism and taken note of the surreal, and perhaps coincidental parallels in this Jiang Wen film about the relentless grab for power and money amongst officials and wannabes, of that fight for moral justice against another hell bent on consolidating ill gotten gains and fending off new entrants to the turf. Jiang Wen doesn't make as many films as he stars in, but here's a Chinese filmmaker with an interesting vision, almost always successfully blending stylish art-house sensibilities and visuals with mass entertainment, bearing the biggest names and featuring the hallmarks of a rich Mandarin language.The incredibly strong story centers around three major characters set in the warring 1920s in China, with Ge You playing Bangde Ma, a man who had unscrupulously bought his position of governorship and is on his way to claim it, having done his sums and understanding the material wealth that comes with holding that position through partnering the rich and the exploitation of the weak. However the train he's travelling in with his wife (Carina Lau) gets hijacked by infamous bandit Pocky Zhang (Jiang Wen) and his band of loyal merry men, who decide to take on Bangde's identity as the incoming Governor of Goose Town, while keeping the real Bangde Ma by their side as a councilor for his political savvy. But standing in their way is the local godfather and real seat of power Wang (Chow Yun-Fat) and his gang, which obviously sets a showdown between the two camps.And I'm not kidding you when I say there are parallels drawn here with our sunny little island, since the introductory shot of Goose Town made it seem like an island that Bangde Ma and Pocky Zhang had to cross into, before confronted with by a wily, scheming political incumbent determined to hold onto his turf and not yield it without a fight. Like politicians, they plot and counterplot against each other's schemes, with deep mistrust all round even when smiling at each other during a round table discussion. Those amongst the elites horde most of the wealth of the town, and it is not until Pocky Zhang had a change in heart and strategy of wealth distribution and moral justice did he find it within himself and his lean, mean team to inch toward power in his fight for the little man. Though of course it's pretty clear still who's being manipulated for someone's objective.As a film, Let the Bullets Fly is sheer spectacle for its action sequences, lush cinematography, and comically awkward CG at times, with some scenes being deliberately and extremely over the top. But that's part of the fun, as the narrative is kept tight with nary a wasted scene, and what would be one of the best parts of the film is the rapid fire dialogue exchange between characters. Black humour is rampant as well to make this very close to a laugh a minute affair through its wickedness, though I have to admit at times things do get lost in translation, especially when required to read between the lines of what's said when the characters try to outdo one another, or in attempts to understand their opponents, through many twists and turns.Stellar performances from the leads make this a must watch as well. Jiang Wen has this air of gravitas associated with his presence, and he makes for a believable bandit who found the moral courage to turn his life, and that of his followers, around to fight the good fight against Chow's Wang. Chow Yun Fat redeems himself from his really cringeworthy foray into Hollywood with dubious roles in films like Dragonball Evolution, and his performance here in dual roles as Wang and his body double, reminds us why Chow is top of the class when he gets his act together in the right charismatic role. Ge You himself is no pushover, although his character gets the least screen time. Still, when all three share the same frame or scene, the mood is nothing short of electrifying, as they banter and feed off one another's energy.And Jiang Wen also assembled a credible ensemble support group with the likes of Carina Lau, Hu Jun in yet another cameo as a make pretend Pocky Zhang, Chen Kun as a cocky young upstart in Wang's camp, and even Feng Xiaogang making a cameo in the beginning of the film trying to suck up to Bangde Ma. You can label it a satire, or an action comedy, but one thing's for sure, this Chinese film showcases just what their industry is capable off in pulling something quirky, offbeat and yet entertaining for the masses. Jiang Wen continues to expand his filmography in a slow but assured pace, and hopefully we can get to see another one of his films soon. Highly recommended as one of the best this year, and I'm really tempted to get the DVD in order to watch this battle of wits all over again."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"This is a movie that I thought would have a simple story and a lot of shoot em up. But it was actually the other way around. In fact this movie sort of reminded me of Quentin Tarantino movies. And wouldn't be shocked if Quentin got some ideas from this movie for ""Django Unchained"". One thing I was disappointed with this movie is how it has Yun-Fat Chow is shown holding a pistol in the back cover of the DVD for this movie. And was hoping for a dual pistol wielding showdown with Yun-Fat Chow and Jiang Wen but that never happens. In fact Jiang Wen is the one that shoots the most in this movie. Chow Yun-Fat and Jiang Wen is just excellent with the roles they are given and are charismatic while also giving off strong impressions. Even is one is the sharp shooting cool anti-hero guy and the other one is a bit obnoxious and yet dominant bad guy. The plot is cleverly crafted although it might have few plot-holes and don't make sense during few scenarios. It's just a very small gripe because everything else is just entertaining to watch. From the dialogue, the acting and the way Pocky Zhang(Jiang Wen) and Huang(Chow Yun-Fat) try to beat each other with mind games and strategy. Overall this is a well crafted movie and clever one as well. It's a movie well worth checking out and I personally will check out more past and future Jian Wen movies.8.1/10"
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"At the time of this writing, this is listed as China's highest-grossing domestic film. I went into it expecting some kind of action-packed blockbuster (especially with the title ""Let the Bullets Fly,"" got me expecting stylish John Woo style gunfights or something). I should have known that this film couldn't be identified by blockbuster terms; it's actually a pretty weird and goofy film, with far less emphasis on action and much more on setting up intricate dialogues and intricate plot points. On its own merits, the film is very fast-paced and dense; it has some gunfighting and action, and a few rather violent scenes, but most of it is focused on the storytelling.The storytelling is satisfying. Even though the comedy can be a huge hit-or-a-miss, and there are a few unbelievable scenes, the characters shine through and dominate the spotlight. It's hard not to enjoy the antics of the bandits and the thugs, and their complex interactions. It's especially hard not to appreciate the complexity of the plotting and counter-plotting that both gangs go through; with the rapid-fire pacing, it may be convoluted for some viewers, but I was never fully lost. Each scene is set up to advance the plot in strange new directions, leading up to a rather fun climax. In the end, I enjoyed watching the chemistry between the characters and their intricate mind games, more than the action.This film has quality photography, and some really fast editing. Acting can be very over-the-top, but Chow Yun-Fat and Jiang Wen both put on iconic performances. Writing is quite witty and sharp. This production has fine-looking period sets, props, and costumes. Certain special effects look awful, but they are few and very far between. Music for this picture is okay (it includes a pretty odd use of drums and chanting toward the end).Chances are that some folks will find the comedy, fast pacing, and complex plot a little hard to follow, so I'd recommend it as a rental. Connoisseurs of Asian cinema will probably enjoy this a little more easily than average western audiences.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)"
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"The opening of the movie proffers LI Shu-tong's sadly languid ""Song of farewell"", the best known musical piece of the period in the warlord-troubled period of China of the early 20th Century. The transition to the farce that follows is a stroke of brilliance.The main drawing card of the movie is of course three superstars in the Chinese language cinema today, JIANG Wen, CHOW Yun-fat and GE You – in the order of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is actually the second time Jiang has fashioned a movie in this way, the first one being ""Tian di ying xiong"" (2003) in which he also took the role of The Good, while roles of The Bad and The Ugly were taken up, respectively, by Kiichi Nakai and WANG Xueqi (who back then had not yet attained today's lofty status in the movie world). The beauty in that one was ZHAO Wei.As mentioned in my summary line, to the main structure of ""The Good, the Bad and The Ugly"" is added certain elements of the Kurosawa's classic Yojinbo (1961). But while therein, the hero (played by Toshiro Mifune) is the guy between two opposite camps, here in ""Bullet"" it's the clown, i.e. The Ugly.I am not going to go into the plot which can be summarized as a convoluted game of power struggles between two rivalling gangs for control a small town. Exciting action and outlandish black humour make the movie thoroughly enjoyable. The highlight is of course the acting of the three superstars. One scene, in particular, must not be missed – the first meeting between The Good and The Bad, with the Ugly as the balancing factor in the subtle confrontation. Just to witness how in this scene the three pull all plugs in their acting reservoir to outdo one another is worth the admission price."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"""Pocky"" Zhang is a notorious bandit who robs trains and any other soft target. When a train robbery turns up no loot, a different prize is sought as it does contain a con artist (Tang) who was on his way to Goose Town to pose as their Governor for a while then make off with the taxes. Zhang agrees to spare Tang in exchange for the role and together they head to Goose Town, however once there they discover that the role of Governor is secondary to that of Godfather – a role held by Master Huang.I came to this film having heard that I wouldn't ""get it"" because it was a Chinese film which was not for the international market. Whether this is the case or not I do not know, but perhaps regardless of nationality, the film only partially worked for me. The plot and the characters weren't an issue for me and I enjoyed the back and forward of the various twists and turns of the story. The action was not quite as good and those coming here for the action suggested by the title will almost certainly be disappointed since it doesn't deliver on that front as much. The comedy aspect is a strange mix and maybe this is the thing that I wouldn't ""get"" by being from Northern Ireland.At times it is quite playful and witty but then at the same time it is pretty violent . In and of itself, I don't have a problem with this because it can work but in this case I didn't feel like it did as the violence was almost too jarring and too heavy or serious to really be able to be darkly funny in the way needed. The direction is a little bit excessive in the same way – not making its different extremes really work together particularly well, but it does still have some things about it which I enjoyed and mostly the tone of the film is consistent. The winner for me was the performances from the lead actors because they sold their characters better than the material did. Chow overplays it perhaps but he is a good foil for the rather calmer playing from Wen Jiang (who I really liked here). Xiaogang Fen is fun too in support as Tang.Although I am not Chinese, I did still quite enjoy this film even if I didn't think it totally worked. The comedy aspect is odd and the violence doesn't always work with it as it should, although the playful spirit of most of the film combines well with the delivery of Chow and Wen to make it better than it otherwise would have been."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"In early 1920s, China was in civil war and it was an era when disorder became part of life. Bangde Ma ( GE, You) who just became the mayor of a remote town through bribery was robbed by a group of bandits led by Pock Zhang ( JIANG, Wen). However Ma could not afford any ransom because he had used up all his money for bribery and the only way to collect money was to use the ruling power of the mayor title. Zhang decided to take Ma's position as the new mayor while Ma posed as his private adviser under the name of Tang.Their destination, the Goose Town, was actually controlled by notorious mafia clan of the Huang family and the only way to collect money was to fully cooperate with the family and handed out most of their gains. However Zhang was only interested in rich families black money and believed in fair justice for each person, which made Huang the IV ( CHOW, Yun-Fat), the boss of the clan, very very unhappy. Almost immediately Zhang and Huang became enemies and the Goose Town would soon turn to be a battle field as well as a stage of hypocrisy, cheating, apathy and snobbery.The first impression of the movie is that it is no doubt of a typical Hollywood style action comedy composed by every piece of commercial element you can find in other Hollywood action movies such as gun firing, explosions, beauties, muscles, fast moving, slangs, and etc. The movie itself is of great fun and you will laugh from the beginning to the end. Also the story is told in a straightforward way and there would be no problem of understanding it even if you have no idea where China is located. The problem, however, is how to interpret Jiang Wen. Let the Bullets Fly is becoming one of the hottest and the most appraised movies in recent years in China neither because it is more dazzling than the Avatar nor because it is more surprising than the Inception. It is welcomed because many Chinese viewers regard the story as a mirror of present China and a movie with strong critical acclaim should have not been approved for public show by the authority such as Jiang Wen's previous movie the Devils on the Doorstep. Interestingly, different people can interpret the movie in a way they like and this may be the power of a comedy. Frankly speaking, if you are not a Chinese, chances are you will enjoy the movie for funny stuff while not the metaphor of the movie."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Review: What a brilliant movie but I must admit, I missed a lot of the plot because the subtitles are going too fast. With that aside, the witty script and brilliant performances from Chow Yun- Fat, (Master Huang) and Wen Jiang, (Pocky Zhang), made this crazy, unique, and definitely unpredictable ride, a joy to watch. When I heard that this movie had a western backdrop, I thought that it was going to be, more like a Cowboys & Indians type of storyline but once the movie gets going, it's a funny political comedy about a ruthless bandit who steals from the rich to give to the poor. The script is top class but it does get a bit complicated after a while, mainly because you have to concentrate on the annoying subtitles. The cinematography and costumes are authentic and the real governor, who wouldn't stop going on about losing his wife, cracked me up. The clever mind and coolness of Pocky Zhang is truly something to watch and the few action scenes were also impressive. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, even though I lost the plot but it's definitely worth a watch, for its originality and crazy storyline. Enjoyable! Round-Up: When this movie was released in December 2010, it broke several box office records in China, and has received critical acclaim. It became the highest grossing domestic film until 2012, when it was beaten by Painted Skin: The Resurrection, which grossed $140million worldwide. The movie was directed by Wen Jiang, 53, who also played the leading character, so he really did give this movie his all. He also contributed his directing skills to New York, I Love You in 2008, which had a top cast, and he brought you Devil's on the Doorstep, The Sun Also Rises and Gone with the Bullets. This movie definitely has something for everybody but you have to be a fast reader to keep up with it.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $104millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/comedy/westerns starring Chow Yun-Fat, You Ge, Wen Jiang, Carina Lau and Jon Hu. 7/10"
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Jiang Wen is a good actor and great director. He reminds me of Clint Eastwood, who is also a good actor and great director. Wen Jiang only have 4 films as director, he is not productive but every film he made is masterpiece to me. I love the Devils on the Doorstep most, it tell some truth no one fear to say.Let The Bullets Fly is newest work of Jiang Wen. I watched the Chuan idiom edition today, very love it. Chuan idiom is one of Chinese hundreds idiom, the people live in Sichuan Province and Chongqing use it in their daily life. The reason why the movie have a idiom edition because the script is adapted from a novel of a old Sichuan writer. That's too much fun to watch the movie with the familiar idiom. However I love it not because the idiom, the reason is it's a good movie.This movie is mixture of Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone, full of bizarre funny idea and masculinity. The last film The Sun Also Rises is criticized too vague, so this one is totally a commercial film. But as the one said in this film, he can made money without knee to others, Jiang Wen not knee to business, there's no disgusting ads and low-grade lines only passion for a good work, that's not easy for present Chinese film. This is why I respect him.Some sensitive people like me aware some political metaphor in this film, this feeling is similar to the one I felt in Devils on the Doorstep. Jiang Wen knows Chinese deeply, or maybe he just so brave and smart can tell the public what he knows. Someones know the truth but they keep it and exchange it with fortune. Someones speak it loudly and directly, they only scared the public and get suffering. Of course in Jiang Wen's way, only small amount of people know what he want to say, but that's enough. Truth always rests with the minority.Although this is a good movie, the non Chinese native speakers may found a little difficult to understand it, it like more a Cult than a commercial film to them."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Jiang Wen did not oppose the CCP. On the contrary, he supported the CCP more than anyone. The role of Zhang Mazi is precisely Mao Zedong. If you really want a showdown between Zhang Mazi and the Lao San, it is only a struggle within the CCP.The reason why this film can pass the censorship of mainland China is because the actual leader of the mainland China, Jiang Zemin, secretly protected it. ""Lao Qi"" is him."

When bandit chief ""Pocky"" Zhang comes to a remote Chinese village he says he is the new mayor. After things go too far and someone ends up dead a battle for revenge begins between him and Master Huang (Yun-Fat). This is a movie I was actually really looking forward to. The preview looked really good and action packed. The first 15 minutes was great and full of action. Then it started to gradually slow down. The story was very interesting and kept me watching, but it really lost momentum and by the end I was starting to lose interest. I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it was like coasting down a mountain, the closer you get to flatting out the slower you go. This is worth seeing but don't expect excitement all the way through. Overall, a good movie that could have been better I think. I give it a B-."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Comedy action film that is currently (rightly) devouring the Asian box office. I had a chance to see it in Chinese (which I don't understand)with no translation into English, but decided to give it ago since I had heard such great things about it.It's got Chow Yun Fat in a wickedly funny role as one of three gangsters who are playing games with each other. I couldn't follow the details I just know that it has some great action and the jokes are funny even when you don't understand Chinese because the cast sells it.For the most part it's not goofy humor, but you still laugh simple because the rhythms of the jokes is there.I watched the film glued to the screen for much of the first hour, but then I realized that as good as it was there was too much I didn't know and I found I was torn between sticking to the end or waiting until the film appears in English either on DVD or in the movies.This is a super film no matter how you slice it.See this movie if you get a chance.(I should mention that while there is plenty of action- and blood- the film isn't a nonstop shoot out as the title might suggest.)"

让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I'm quite lagging behind the progress of recent Chinese film market, LET THE BULLETS FLY is still the No.1 film in the all-time domestic grossing (approximately 100 million US dollars, it seems that the record still holds steady judging by the under-performance of Yimou Zhang's THE FLOWERS OF WAR 2011 and Hark Tsui's THE FLYING SWORDS OF DRAGON GATE 2011 in the past Christmas season), and its preeminent word-of-mouth prompts itself as a must-see for every aficionado, it is a bit shameful of me to been not have watched this one, aside from that I'm a bona fide Chinese, thus I chose this one as the first film to start my 2012. However the road is bumpier than I thought, at first the abrupt dialogs and some implausible scenes grate on my nerves (particularly the absurdly droll disembowelment suicide). But it is a genuine slow burner, the tension ignited by a spanked-up manhood hegemony is sterlingly fabricated at the latter part, there is a conspicuous political intent has been underlined in a metaphorical method while contains some visceral vibes being spiritually entertaining and optically stylish! As a matter of fact the censorship of cinema in China is harshly stern (politically preferred), thus it is wondrous to guess how this film had evaded it and subsequently became the highest grossing one in the Chinese film history, lots of context reading could be arresting and effectual for other film directors. As the elite in contemporary Chinese film market, LET THE BULLETS FLY is Wen Jiang's most ambitious work to date (after a failed attempt with DEVILS ON THE DOORSTEP 2000, which was shut down completely in the domestic cinema due to some political reasons, and a box office debacle in 2007 with THE SUN ALSO RISES), Wen cunningly harness a cast with trio male leaders, which has an overpowering appeal towards nearly all the Chinese audience. You Ge (a household name in China and majorly allures the large northern demography) stands out in the mêlée, his satirical aura is the key catalyst in the film and also salts his tragical doom with a poignant flavor. Yun-Fat Chow (the Hongkong marque name which has more box-office sway in southern area) is solid too, but his villainy is a trifle overstated with his over-stately appearance. The real top dog is Wen himself, the winner both in and outside the film, with a gutsy supporting characters (Yun Zhou, Carina Lau is the meager female included).Hardware-wise, the film represents the top-notch level of contemporary Chinese film (one exception is the CGI effect of the opening train accident, which is risibly artificial), and the final battle of the strategy about acquiring the dominance and manipulating of the mass demonstrates that Wen is the master of fashioning a compelling period mainstream work with modern political allegory, which is a highly valued rare bird in this era."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"LET THE BULLETS FLY has an extraordinarily fast pacing to recommend it, so you better be ready to pay attention with this one. It's a twist-a-minute tale of gangsters battling corrupt politicians in a remote township, where everybody is saddled down with greed and rivalry and death is only a footstep away. The film it most reminded me of is THE GOOD THE BAD THE WEIRD, with both films revelling in their quirkiness and action-packed narratives, although this isn't quite as good as the Korean movie.I was thinking about LET THE BULLETS FLY after I'd finished watching it and I realised that in reality this is quite a slight tale; not much in the way of substance really happens come the end, but it's the journey there which is so entertaining. This is highbrow, intelligent humour for the most part, where the fun comes from watching Chow Yun-Fat and Jiang Wen doing their best to constantly outwit each other. What the film has going for it are two fine performances from the leads and some great cinematography, which makes the various violent interludes highly enjoyable. It's a film that brims with energy and gusto, although I did find it quite wearying especially in the second half. Good fun but now I know the outcome I don't see any need to watch it again."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I watched this movie several times and it not only commercial but also has some point of views to dig deeper.This virtual history reflect true Chinese society characteristics.Some may have changed after new China was established, some still deep rooted inside the nation's spirits.If China wants to develop even further and become a law-constrained country, it must face up to something this movie referred and truly change some way of acts."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Plot: A bandit impersonates the new governor of a town and comes into conflict with the crime boss who runs it.This film is essentially a Western set in the Warlord China of the 1920s. It is full of zest and at its best it is a charming mix of cartoon action, physical humour and bravura performances by the leads. Its desire to simply play around with genres, techniques and conventions is wonderfully endearing and very interesting. The gunplay in particular, which becomes a sort of ballistic chop-socky, is superb. But the problem is that the script is too messy, desperately in need of an edit. Nearly every character is pretending to be someone - or someones - else, whilst the conflict between the two gangs is largely played out through ruses and deception rather than fighting. The result is a hugely over-complex, over-long and needlessly confusing plot. This film ought to have been a good 30 minutes shorter and a great deal tighter - and would have been all the better for it. Nonetheless, this is an interesting and enjoyable mess.Worth one viewing."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Jiang Wen is one of China's less well-known directors, especially to filmgoers outside of China. Famously acting as the male lead opposite Gong Li in Zhang Yimou's Red Sorghum (1988), Jiang is a more familiar face than name, but the few works that he has directed have appeared in major film festivals worldwide including his most acclaimed feature Devil on the Doorstep (2000), which won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes. His latest endeavor, Let the Bullets Fly, for better or worse, is significantly more mainstream, and is a surprising box-office hit in mainland China.Let the Bullets Fly is a bizarre film to begin with. It is a film that does not know whether to take itself seriously or not as an action- comedy. It starts with a tense sequence showing a few bandits attempting to rob a train with the governor and his wife aboard. It is serious business, with quick cuts of the bandits taking aim with their rifles, suggesting a well-planned attack. And then the big moment comes when the train is derailed. It is a moment that leaves me stunned.Let the Bullets Fly is not so much an action film in the context of a pure Asian martial arts flick, but a comedy with Western-action elements that even the characters themselves find funny to be involved in. Frankly, if there is a sub-genre called farcical cinema, this film would be an excellent example. To his credit, Jiang's direction of the actors is quite impressive, with the chemistry between Chow Yun-Fat, Ge You, and Jiang himself showing positive signs of spot-on comic timing, though it must be said that much of the humor is derived from mind games played not only to confuse and amuse viewers but also to themselves.Let the Bullets Fly is without doubt an exercise in exaggeration – everything from acting to dialogue to dramatic set-pieces – such that the film overwhelms viewers before it even passes the midpoint mark. As a result, the second half becomes too entertaining for its own good, with potential viewers likely to feel empty watching the flurry of activities that occur on screen. The lead characters are also not developed fully, if they are developed at all. They are almost the same at the start of the film as the end, with no clear transformation. Worse, Jiang's film ends predictably and unsatisfyingly, even to the extent of meaninglessly linking the epilogue back to the opening sequence.In a nutshell, Let the Bullets Fly is a lamentable attempt to break into commercial filmmaking by Jiang, though box office figures tells us a different tale. Despite charismatic actors on board, the film seems to drag along with the sole motivation to quench viewers' thirst for more farce. Stay away from this unless you like draggy, farcical films.GRADE: C- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"""Let the bullets fly for a while""This is also one of the central sentences of the film. In the opening, Jiang Wen banged several shots, and there was no movement at the foot of the mountain. Brother asked: missed? Jiang Wen said with a smile: Let the bullets fly for a while. Yes, let the bullets fly for a while before hitting or not hitting the target, which is why, Jiang Wen asked the younger to give an exclamation mark, but he made a question mark.The rhythm of the film is also the same, fast in the front, but slowed down in the end. Jiang Wenzema urged the people to walk out of his house over and over again. In order to wait for the final gathering, Jiang Wen ambushed the bamboo forest for 3 days.Reforms need to wait, allow mistakes, and let the bullets fly for a while. The stride is too big, easy to pull the egg. Of course the final outcome is an extremely bold and optimistic political fable.In addition, this process is not without irony. The incendiary dance halfway feels like taking up the enemy's weapon.""Standing and earning money""Jiang Wen has also revealed a bit of thinking about the film itself from time to time in the film.He yelled, ""I wouldn't believe it and stand, I still can't make any money?"" It is undoubtedly the manifestation of the grievances of the upper part of grievances and pride.At the end of the film, his brethren walked one by one, expressing their comments one after another, the boss was ""not easy"" to mix with you. I believe this is Jiang Wen's helpless or rogue review of his role as a director and his feeling of being too heroic."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Naturally when I was given the chance to sit down and watch the 2010 movie ""Rang zi dan fei"" (aka ""Let the Bullets Fly"") I jumped at the chance, given the fact that it was a Chinese movie and it had Chow-Yun Fat in one of the lead roles.However, my excitement was abruptly cut short as the events of the movie unfolded on the screen and as the movie trotted on. First of all, the movie was long. Way, way too long. Running at two hours and twelve minutes, this movie was an ordeal to sit through. And truth be told, the pacing of the movie and the storyline just wasn't well-written or good enough to support this play time, and it ended up being an ordeal and a drag to sit through. In fact, I gave up 20 minutes before the movie ended from a lack of interest in the movie, the characters and the events in the storyline.Director Wen Jiang seemed to had bitten off a bit more than it was possible to chew, and the movie suffered from it. It seems that the storyline by writers Junli Guo, Wen Jiang, Bukong Li, Ma Shitu, Ping Shu, Xiao Wei and Sujin Zhu was just a bit too ambitious and ended up running in circles and providing less and less interesting entertainment as the movie trotted on.The characters in the movie started out as being okay, but eventually slipped gradually more and more into a zone where it was becoming too comical to match the tone of the movie, and also - at least for me - to the point where I just stated to lose interest in them.And the length of the movie, as I mentioned earlier, was a drag. If the movie had been just 30 or 40 minutes shorter, the outcome and enjoyability of the movie would have been so much different.My rating for ""Let the Bullets Fly"" is a mediocre five out of ten stars, with no intention of returning to finish the last part that I gave up on."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Although the movie is allegedly set during the Chinese civil war, the first phase of the war between the Nationalists and Communists did not start until 1927, and the movie appears to be set in a time before the first phase began.The underlying story is about a bandit (played by Wen Jiang) who disguises himself as a local ""governor"" (mayor of a town). His motive is acquiring wealth through fraud, or so one is lead to believe initially. Instead, the movie turns into a complex mind-game between the bandit, named Pocky Zhang, and a local war lord (Master Huang, played by Yun-Fat Chow). A struggle ensues, and the storyline turns on who will prevail. Prostitutes (with hearts of gold, of course -- something movies seem to love even though divorced from reality) also play a major role in the story.The joy of the movie is watching the two protagonists (each served by loyal and capable side-kicks) try to one-up each other. There are plots within plots within plots. The film is also laced with farce and a few guest appearances by an excellent traditional Chinese drum band. All characters have traits that are both admirable and foolish.Can you stay one step ahead of the protagonists as they scheme and counter-scheme? Good luck.My one criticism is that the English language subtitles are small and pass by on the screen so fast that it is often hard to read them completely.If you enjoy watching cleverness unfold, with the hero ultimately prevailing, and you do not mind struggling with the dialog, this is a cute movie. It is a much more sophisticated sojourn into Chinese culture and greed that the traditional kung-fu movie. It is likely that the script reflects more than a tad of Party influence since our hero, the bandit, ultimately turns out to have a heart of gold (no pun)and care only for ""the people."" Fortunately, this does not distract from the plot or the characters. Wen Jiang and Yun-Fat Chow are superb lead characters, as one would expect of actors of their quality.The movie is long at 132 minutes, but you will never be bored. Even the special effects are exceedingly well done."

让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Advertised as a shoot em up, gun fu action flick, Let The Bullets Fly is anything but. The plot is interesting, but is too convoluted and wildly confusing, which would have worked if the film were directed in a more digestible manner. The action is far and few between, with only about 9 1/2 minutes of poorly shot and poorly directed shootouts in a 124 minute drama-dey. The special effects are very bad, and the sense of any rising action is bogged down by way too much talking, and not enough shooting. For a film that advertises big flash, LTBF fizzles. The acting is very good though, and Jiang Wen and Chow Yun-Fat are excellent and very charismatic. But this film is so ridiculously cluttered, confusing, and just plain boring, you'll have spent your time watching better foreign films, such as IP MAN, The Good The Bad The Weird, or Hard Boiled. The only thing I can walk away and say about this film is that it undeniably sets itself up for brilliance, and then follows a horrendous train ride to boring-town. The bullets don't fly, but the snores do."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I don't know what to make of this movie. The trailer promised lots of action and remembering some of Chow Yun Fats best movies, I had high hopes. But instead of tons of action, we get a movie about two men trying to outwit each other in a macabre duel of treachery:A robber becomes an impostor, assuming the role of a towns new governor. He soon begins to oppose the towns true ruler, a crime lord in a game of deadly schemes. This could be very entertaining, if most of the humor wasn't lost in translation. The non verbal humor is basically slapstick and seems kind of outdated. The acting was okay, the characters had some depth to them, especially the ""robber"". There were some CGI effects in the movie and they were terribly bad.It's an uneven mixture that'll probably prove to be boring or confusing to most watchers."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I have to own up to being perplexed about Let the Bullets Fly. It has a very solid 66% Metacritic rating, a positively whopping 7.4 IMDB rating and back in the day, was a huge commercial success in China and I really don't know why. I found this movie utterly boring.I won't even try to summarise the confusing and totally uninteresting plot, which was mainly concerned with characters assuming other characters' identities and bad guys trying to rip off one another, with one Robin Hood type, nobly wanting to redistribute any profits to the poor. In a dramatis personae which is way too numerous for its own good anyway, to add to the silliness we also have doppelgängers of key persons tossed into the mix. It's enough to get your head spinning.Writer/director Jiang Wen was likely aiming for a Chinese Tarantino - type black comedy, but fails miserably on so many counts. Crucially, the movie is not funny. The dialogue (and there is huge reams of the stuff continually babbled by the afore-mentioned extensive cast) is dull, not sharp with any comic edge and the occasional action sequences are best described as cartoonish as opposed to exciting. Without spoiling, I think it's safe to say that lots of people die in really foolish ways, which I think the audience were supposed to find humorous. Unsurprisingly the tone of the film is completely uneven. It just doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, but is certainly no cross-generic success.Why so many of the actors felt the need to continually shout their lines as quickly as possible I don't really know? Notably Jiang Wen, who also plays one of the 2 leads thankfully delivers his lines in a far more relaxed manner. I wished he'd advised other cast members to do likewise. I always enjoy seeing the wonderful Chow Yun-fat, but he is very much wasted here playing mobster boss Master Huang. Picture Morgan Freeman trying to do a nasty Eddie Murphy. It doesn't really fit does it and that's what you're faced with.Let the Bullets Fly is a two and a quarter hour film that feels like 4 hours. Guaranteed you'll be checking your watches early and then working out you've still got a long, tedious way to go. And then when you're certain you have reached the very dull conclusion, understand you're still amazingly about 20 minutes from the end. I really think I've been very generous in giving this 4/10. Sadly, it ain't no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, by a very long way."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Jiang Wen's Let The Bullets Fly is a very original piece of cinema that blends genres seemingly with ease to create a fantastic and unique cinematic experience. This film is hard to put in one category but I am reminded most of Korean western The Good, The Bad And The Weird and Kung Fu Hustle, to get an idea. The story has a group of bandits with a Robin Hood ethos at odds with a ruthless gangster(played by Chow Yun Fat) and their attempts to outwit one another. The film looks fantastic and the film is very tight and well performed. The film is recommended to watch multiple times to try to fully grasp and absorb the film as a whole as there is much to take in on one sitting. There are plot twists galore with large doses of Chinese black humor, sprinkled with small doses of extreme violence and some gunplay. The film goes by at a rapid pace and has some tremendous performances. Let The Bullets Fly was a huge box office hit in China and got some well earned critical acclaim. This is recommended for cinema lovers looking for something complex, rich and at times bonkers."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"The first half is really good, but unfortunately the tension of the plot began to decline seriously in the middle. Zhang Ma-zi's personality is too honest to be a bandit."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"If William Shakespeare had written a western that takes place in China at the beginning of the 20th century, it would be thus. This intricate plot contains many of the hallmarks of Shakespearean storytelling, conveyed with clever and engaging dialogue and satisfying action: murder, revenge, hidden identities, nobility of purpose, greed, political machinations, romance, violence, greathearted heroes, petty tyrants, henchmen, and impostors. My only real complaint with this film is that the denouement is a little weak. But, overall, I loved it.If you buy/rent it on DVD, I would recommend viewing it in Mandarin with English subtitles —I found that the English overdub was enjoyable, but a little too ""American""; the subtitles had more punch, and kept the flavour of the original Mandarin (fyi, watching it with English overdub *and* English subtitles is trippy)."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I'm not a huge fan of Chinese cinema, although I do enjoy many of the films that get released in America. And while I enjoy the wuxia fighting scenes in most Chinese action films, it does get a little predictable after awhile. However, while Let the Bullets Fly is definitely an action film, there is very little, if any, wuxia fight scenes. Instead the film relies on American-style shoot-em-ups, clever dialog, and a clever (but at times complex) plot. The acting is also surprisingly very strong for a film like this, particularly Ge You who is very funny as the exasperated counselor to the governor. Director Jiang Wu also stars as the bandit masquerading as the governor. Chow Yun-Fat is not the focus of this movie, but he does well in the role as the local strongman, and has a great laugh that is frequently used. All in all, an interesting and atypical Chinese action/comedy film that's right now the highest grossing domestic Chinese film ever made. It's definitely worth a look."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,This is one of those movies where it's really hard to enjoy if you're not from its origin country and/or know the language and cultural references. There were a lot of smart and funny parts of the movie even without knowing these details but I don't think its really meant for a foreign audience. But besides that it had very good acting by some of the familiar faces in Chinese cinema and a different very fast paced style of storytelling.The story of a bandit who goes to a small village posing as their new mayor to make some money off of them has to face the strongest local family.

让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"I didn't like it as a movie and was slightly offended by it after seeing it for the firs time. Then I watched it again and realized it is actually a series of encrypted political messages disguised as a movie. You can call it a movie if you consider movie an 'entertainment' and that this is the way Chinese people in China are entertained, with bitterness and cynicism. Everything in the movie is just too 'real' and it is painful (for me) to watch. Director Jiang, Wen had too much to say and couldn't say it directly. Starting from the title, if you notice that the title that first appeared was translated to be 'let the bullet fly for a while; then 'for a while' was removed. This was Jiang Wen's first message: everything he tries to say has to be in disguise, sometimes mixed with jokes in bad tastes such as when he said how he followed General Cai'e during the revolution then became bandit after Cai died in Japan, which was followed by Ge You's digression on when he was 17 blah blah blah, the title means you need to wait for a while before the message goes through to audience (had to bypass censorship first) There were dialogues in the movie nobody can get right away and tell what logical purpose it serves, such as when Huang Cilang said he met Ma bandit 20 years before, together with other mysterious dialogues reveal who they were and how they became who they are now. They both implied that they know Japanese suicide rituals well, which meant they were both close to the revolution etc. Anyway, it is painful to watch because it is so real."

All the hidden metaphors/satires are, simply put, genius.Who were the bullets intended for, you ask? The dim-witted bureaucrats of the censorship office who thought this was a comedy. And thought of it a comedy they did!

让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"This is one of the movies that should be on the list of national heritages of China but it is not surprising to see that the rating is only 7.7 on IMDb . In most cases, I am confident to say this: people without at least some exposure to the recent history of China will not and cannot appreciate the depth and the symbolism of this movie.Another aspect that is hindering the understanding of the movie is the line. The fast pace of the movie makes it necessary to watch it several times before you can really getting the lines hidden beneath the outstanding perfomance of Jiang wen, Chow Yun-Fat and Ge You. Every line in the movie is only the tip of the iceburg of the information that is being conveyed. Certain words are carefully chosen to serve the purpose, which also makes it difficult to translate into English. A lot of the meaning got lost during the trasnlation.Please do not treat it as an action movie where a ganster trying to fight and outwit the kingpin. It is NEVER just about greed, rivalry and death.To me, this movie is the anthem for the people who saw the injustice and fought for a change."
让子弹飞,Let the Bullets Fly (2010),,2010,2012.03.02,"Others asked Jiang Wen ""por una cabeza"" tribute to which films, Jiang Wen said, ""I'm so arrogant one, not that habit."" It's like when ""Black Snow"" was exhibited at the Berlin Film Festival and won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, a reporter interviewed Jiang Wen and said his performance was very much like Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, asking if Jiang Wen liked them a lot, and Jiang Wen said, ""Sorry, I've never heard of them."" But someone ""leaked"": Jiang Wen asked Xie Fei(the director of Black Snow) for the video of Raging Bull , because he especially liked Robert De Niro, the actor, and wanted to learn the tough guy method of acting.He said, ""I just want you to know that some parts of him(Mao) is not what you say he is.""Because the symbols do not necessarily correspond to something one-to-one, nor does everything has an object, as Lu Xun said, (),For example, Zhang Mu Zhi(Pocky Zhang) is obviously a mixture of Mao and Zhu De; Jin Yong's novel ""Laughing Proudly at the World"" is a metaphor for the affairs of the First Republic(1949~1977) and the Second Republic(1977~1992), but obviously not every character and plot in the novel are a metaphor for something.This story can be a metaphor for multiple periods at the same time, both the time of the Chinese Civil War and the time after the founding of the republic (People's republic of China).The horse-drawn train (Marxism-Leninism, ""horse-train"" in Chinese) came with the long-lost Iron Blood Eighteen Stars (the pattern of the flag used in the Wuchang Uprising that overthrew the Qing Dynasty), Shanghai (the place where the early Communist Party leaders seated) and intellectuals ""eating hot pot and singing songs"", and the National Revolution was successful, but this era was still the same as the past.Pocky Zhang had followed General Song Po (Cai E who had launched a crusade against Yuan Shikai, who restored the imperial system in the Republic) and each of them(Pocky Zhang and Huang Silang) had been in the shadow of the lamp.He(Mao) taught people ""no kneeling"".It's thought that Good people should not defend themselves, that they should be held at gunpoint, that they should have their hearts cut open to prove their innocencePeople always thought that a bandit's name could not be ""Zhang Mu Zhi""(shepherd), but ""Pocky Zhang"", and that his face should really have pockmarks.The enemies dressed up as communists to oppress the people.The third eldest brother (Deng Xiaoping (rice shopping, Deng was partially responsible for the famine, and although Deng's reform and opening up changed China, it also opened the door to corruption and power rent-seeking)) pretended to wear the mask of the eldest brother(Mao,. Was he trying to take big brother's seat? Or did he give orders while wearing big brother's mask?The Counselor(intellects) betrayed them(The Communist,.Great Leap Forward and the Great Chinese Famine was the son of intellectuals/propagandists. The intellectuals thought it was because Mao that they were blown up, but that was actually fake Mao.The people were ignorant, numb and slow, ""whoever wins they help"". They called upon a great lord to do justice for them, a great man from heaven to lead the people. Although in the end the power of the people was always required. I call this conception of history the ""hunk man theory"", hoping that a hunk man will come from heaven to lead the people. They do not take their fate into their own hands, but leave it in the hands of others.The bad impressions people had of Mao were because of deception; the bad things they thought he had done were done by others.Parts of history were omitted, the Anti-Japanese War was hidden, his retreating to the second line because of his fault; he was not responsible for the rest (the famine and other things), he did not know, he should not take the blame. But where is his ""last revolution""(The Cultural revolution), his last dance of war against human nature itself (human weakness, limitation, greed and classes)? And where did that beautiful cruelty go? This film does not show this part of history. The mass witch-hunting movement (the Cultural Revolution), with its unbridled lynchings all over the place, has disappeared in the movie.Where were the soldiers of Brigadier Guo (U. S. And Huang Silang, who ran the bulk of the Republic of China's tobacco businesss for Brigadier Guo, symbolizes the Kuomintang (KMT), who in this narrative is the Comprador-like role)? The United States was ""defeated"" by a war ""in which China fought a war of national prestige that influenced the subsequent world situation (e.g., the Vietnam War)"", by a war of defense, by a meaningless test of who could endure the meaninglessness longer, or by a proxy war of imperialism between two hegemonic powers (China and America) on the land of Korea and North Korea.The second eldest brother died because of the and betrayal and Counselor's whistle. But how did the ""other"" second (Liu Shaoqi, killed by Red Guards students during the Cultural Revolution, when he was the president of China) die?The people took everything away, even the seat he (Mao) was sitting in. But what about the land that was promised to the people by the Party and then taken away, the dualistic structure of urban areas and rural areas (artificially dividing people into urban and rural areas and restricting population movement with a household registration system), and the Price scissors?Deng Xiaoping was tempted and betrayed the revolution, he took the woman who used to be ""more beautiful with a gun"" to Shanghai (capitalism), ""Pudong is Shanghai, Shanghai is Pudong"". The bureaucrats and capitalists came back, and they came back in the skin of Counselor, in the skin of intellectuals.A spectre was/is haunting on the track of history - the spectre of Maoism, leaving a distant back in the sunset."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Tsui Hark goes back to the well to draw fresh inspiration, returning once more to King Hu's classic Dragon Gate Inn - which he already remade rather wonderfully in 1992. The story is given a fresh set of details to flesh it out, but the basic skeleton remains the same - evil eunuchs, patriotic rebels and independent forces of uncertain allegiance all converge on the eponymous inn, where identities are masked and secrets concealed until a game of wits allows the various parties to ascertain where they all stand - and exactly whose ass they need to kick.This is not the first time that Tsui Hark has convinced himself that what one of his classic films really needed was an update with loads of CGI - witness Legend of Zu in 2001, an exercise which failed to convince anybody else of that viewpoint. This time he has an extra decade of Chinese experience in CGI to draw on though, and what's more... now he can do it in 3D! Well, I will have to take the internet's word for that, 'cause I watched in boring old 2D (albeit HD). Can he convince us this time that computer graphics are the tool he's been waiting for all along to truly unleash his imagination? No, he can't. Aside from a few impressive moments, the CGI still looks rather fake, and fails to impress or engage as well as the low-budget special effects (wires, clever camera work) that made the 1992 film such an impressive spectacle. Furthermore, he seems to have failed to note the main factor that caused Legend of Zu to rank so much lower in fans' hearts than its 1983 predecessor... all the special effects in the world won't engage an audience if they don't get involved in the story. Well-defined, likable (or hateable, where appropriate) characters whose fates we actually care about will encourage us to forgive any weaknesses in the special effects, but the converse is rarely true. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate fails to deliver on characters, and fails to develop the plot. The film begins by introducing the political intrigues of the court and the rival factions of the Eunuchs, then fails to provide any particular relevance to this detail. Jet Li plays a rebel who we assume to be patriotic, but doesn't actually offer any explanation whatsoever as to as his motivations, his particular plights, or much of a character at all (though he gets more than most). Various groups are introduced, and brought together at the inn, then the film sort of flounders for a little bit before everybody just sort of decides its time to start fighting. The sense of intrigue, the subtle details, the game of wits as these master fighters out-smart and out-guess each other... the actual meat of King Hu's original film, in other words... pretty much replaced by 'hey, one of the good guys happens to look exactly like the chief bad guy!'.Oh well, Jet Li's on hand, so at least there must be some spectacular action, right? Oh yeah, I forgot... he got old. There are some nicely choreographed action scenes in places, but with too much reliance on CGI of mixed effectiveness.Maybe I'm viewing the older films with a touch of rose-tinting, or maybe I'm just getting old and tHe KidZ will see the many virtues of the latest attempt to improve a classic that I'm missing. It probably did look quite spectacular in 3D-capable cinemas... but I am yet to be convinced that that can ever take the place of a well written script, or a director who still remembers that he has human actors on set somewhere, and that getting a great performance out of them is probably the most important of his job."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Who better to attempt the world's first 3D 'wuxia' movie than Tsui Hark- the man is behind some of the genre's most iconic representations like 'The Swordsman', 'Green Snake' and 'Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain', and with the latter also a pioneer for introducing Hollywood- style special effects to Chinese cinema. It seems befitting therefore that almost thirty years later, Tsui Hark should be the one to import the latest Hollywood fad for the same genre- and true enough, the veteran director's maiden effort at the third dimension is nothing less than impressive.Like James Cameron, Tsui brings his considerable experience as a director to bear on the use of 3D to immerse his viewer into his cinematic vision. Gimmicks aside (yes, you'll still find all kinds of flying objects- wooden beams, arrows, knives and swords- coming straight at you), Tsui crafts each shot- static or moving- meticulously to create depth in every one of them and provide raison d'etre for the use of 3D. Tsui has of course had some generous help from Hollywood expert Chuck Comisky (who oversaw the visual effects for 'Avatar'), and the result is a milestone for the 'wuxia' genre as well as for Chinese cinema.Alas for all its technical achievements, this loose remake of his classic 'New Dragon Gate Inn' unfortunately is let down by more conventional elements like plot and character. As with his earlier movie, the setup here is also the gathering of three disparate groups of individuals at a trading post in the middle of the desert. On one hand, there is the vigilante Zhao Huai'an (Jet Li), Zhao's female equivalent Ling Lanqiu (Zhou Xun), as well as a runaway palace maid Su (Mavis Fan) impregnated by the Emperor and therefore an assassination target by the Empress to preserve the lineage. On the other, there are the formidable Western Bureau troops, led by their fearsome commander Yu Huatian (Chen Kun), who have been sent by the Empress to kill Su and eliminate those opposed to the reigning monarchy.The pursuit of the latter for the former leads their paths to cross with a ragtag group of bandits in search of ancient treasure buried under the sand near the inn. The advent of a once-in-60-years major sandstorm is supposed to unearth the treasure, and among those waiting to get a share of the riches are Gu Shaotang (Li Yuchun), Yu Huatian's doppelganger White Blade (also Chen Kun) as well as an intimidating Tartar warrior princess Buludu (Gwai Lun Mei) and her band of loutish tribesmen. Setting up such a sheer number of characters takes time, and a good half-hour is spent on exposition detailing these individuals and their relationships with each other. The effect of this after an exciting first half-hour watching Zhao assassinate the leader of the Eastern Front (Gordon Liu) and then finding himself outmatched by Yu is like adding a lead weight to the proceedings, so much so that what momentum the film had going for it is almost completely lost.Perhaps even more significant is that Jet Li is practically absent during this half-hour, and by the time he does reappear to join in the action-packed finale, it's too late for any significant characterisation to allow his crusading warrior Zhao Huai'an to rise above the fray. There is a past romance hinted at with Zhou Xun's Ling, but Tsui provides too little elaboration on it- and if Jet Li's Zhao is thinly drawn, you can pretty much guess that the rest of the characters also suffer the same fate.Not only does this first reunion of Tsui Hark and Jet Li outside the 'Once Upon A Time in China' series fail to create a cinematic icon like Wong Fei-Hung, it also gives Jet Li surprisingly little to do in the action department. As if hemmed in by the movie's title, Jet Li is almost always duelling only with his swords while performing some gravity-defying flight through the air, with ultimately too little of the lightning-quick hand-to-hand combat we've come to love about the action star. Not to say that Yuen Bun's action choreography doesn't thrill (it does, especially with Tsui's ability to direct elaborate action sequences), but one hopes that Yuen (who was also behind Tsui's 'New Dragon Gate Inn' back in 1992)- and his co-choreographers Lan Ha Han and Sun Jiankui- had exploited Jet Li's martial arts prowess for more.While it fails to capitalise on its key asset (i.e. Jet Li), the film does deliver some thrilling action sequences that blend old-school choreography with modern-day CG wizardry- the showdown between Zhao and Yu right in the middle of a raging sandstorm is an excellent example of this combination. Amid the wire-ful stunts, the excellently staged swordplay stands out- and it is Zhou Xun, rather than Jet Li, who impresses with her elegant moves. Kudos too to Choi Sung-fai's fluid cinematography and Yau Chi-wan's deft editing in all the elaborately staged action sequences- especially one which seamlessly intercuts between the action inside the inn and below the inn when the triumvirate first converge.In terms of visual spectacle, Tsui Hark is definitely at the top of his game, both the action choreography and the initiation of 3D into the 'wuxia' genre easily establishing itself as one of the must-see classics. Nonetheless, for all its technical achievements, this latest reworking of the 'Dragon Inn' mythology is let down by its poorly drawn characters and at times its frenetic over-plotting of deceptions and double-crosses. And even as Tsui has more than proved his prowess with new-fangled Hollywood magic, one wishes that he had also not forgotten his faculty for old-school elements like plot and character- after all, it was these that made his 1992 'New Dragon Gate Inn' such an enduring masterpiece."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"During the Ming dynasty, the corrupt imperial eunuchs are using their powers to wrongly accuse government officials and taking over the country. The eunuchs are divided into the old East Bureau and the newer West Bureau as the emperor's all knowing spies. Zhao Huai'an (Jet Li) defeats the dictatorial leaders of the East Bureau. The West Bureau led by Yu is more skilled and chases after Zhao Huai'an. The Emperor's chief concubine Wan refuses to let any other maids get pregnant. Pregnant maid Su Huirong escapes and gets rescued by a Zhao Huai'an impostor. Zhao Huai'an sees his impostor and Su Huirong chased by the West Bureau. They head out west and end up in the desert outpost Dragon Gate during a sand storm. There they find bandits, Mongols, crooks, thieves, and rumors of a hidden treasure.This starts off as a battle between Zhao Huai'an and eunuch Yu. However the story keeps adding characters. It's not incomprehensible but it is a disjointed way of story telling. The movie has plenty of CGI fights and big scenes. I'm willing to go with it until the various groups gather at Dragon Gate and I'm forced to more or less give up. It becomes a mess and I stop caring about half the people in this movie."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I have to say I was a disappointed in this movie. If you are going to have Jet Li as the main character, why CGI so much of the martial arts? Almost none of the martial arts scenes were live action, and those that were live action were sadly lacking in clarity, the director preferring quick cuts and flash over substance.The story itself wasn't bad. It is a bit more complicated than the average kung-fu movie, which explains the two hour run time of the movie. Sadly, much of the depth in the movie felt added on, as if they took a chunk from several movies and added them together.Also, I have to say, the opening sequence reminded me of something your would see at the beginning of a video game, rather than an actual movie.I would wait to see this one on video."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Sorry but I was very disappointed with this movie. I do like Jet Li and I think he is an excellent Martial Artist, but you wouldn't know it from this film. Set three years after Dragon Inn, the innkeeper Jade has disappeared and a new inn has risen from the ashes but occupied by marauders, who hope to find lost city and treasure buried in the desert somewhere.The way the film was directed made it overly confusing to follow and as others have said the film relies much to much on CGI. The fight sequences were over long and at times ridiculous. I know some Chinese films over use wire work and CGI but this one took it even further to show the characters flying through the air having and having amazing powers so that a flick of the hand could cause inanimate objects to do whatever they wanted. Yes despite these amazing powers they were in the end killed by relatively simple means. The sword fights were also ridiculous with a never ending stream of knives appearing from nowhere.This is NOT a Martial Arts film but rather a fantasy more like watching a Video game than a movie.It is a shame because there were some good actors in this film, but the director seems to have let things go to his head and lost the plot.This is one DVD for the bargain basket I am afraid."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"The Flying Swords of Dragon Inn expands upon the mythos created in the earlier two films, and throws in a lot more formidable characters as well as their respective selfish objectives and missions, starting with the lead character of Zhou Huai'an (Jet Li), a vigilante in the Ming Dynasty responsible for a spate of killings of corrupt court officials. With the King forming the East and West Bureaus in the same fashion as the FBI and CIA respectively, an incredible set action piece that serves as a prologue has Zhou dispatching the head of the East Bureau in a special appearance by the legendary Gordon Liu, to make the case of how powerful Zhou is with his lightning quick reflexes and special moves that we don't see much of, and gets that special effects boost as well.You see, Zhou disappears for about more than half the movie, which is a pity since Jet Li's star billing is used everywhere. Like a wandering swordsman who pops up every now and then to help the poor and the weak, the damsel in distress here is a palace handmaiden (Mavis Fan) who is on the run for carrying what would be the Dragon baby, impregnated by a naturally lecherous Emperor whose concubine sets the entire plot in motion for wanting any female with the possibility of producing a bloodline to the throne terminated. With Yu Hua Tian (Chen Kun), the head of the West Bureau her pillow partner, the game is afoot when the handmaiden gets rescued by Ling Lanqiu (Zhou Xun), the female equivalent of Zhou Huai'an whose brooding demeanour hints at a past romantic liaison with Zhou, and who harbours some secrets of the infamous Dragon Inn which is now populated by rag tag characters, There are subplots galore in the film, whose screenplay is also written by Tsui Hark, that will call for your utmost attention in order to keep pace and make sense of it all, some properly developed while others relying on your past knowledge of the Dragon Inn mythos as foundation in which this retelling is based on, allowing you to connect the dots why certain events are done the way they are now. For instance, in Hu's original film, there are bloodlines on the run which get congregated at Dragon Inn, and this one loosely follows that rationale. And for once, we know why various groups descend upon this inn in the middle of nowhere, if not for the very ordinary reason of having treasure buried somewhere in the midst of the vast wasteland, and to hunt for it meant to exploit the tunnels beneath the inn, make sense of some inscribed couplets, and depending on 1 in 60 years (not 1 in 50 years ponding in Singapore mind you) geographic events to allow all the cards to fall into place.However, like all great martial arts epic, the fun always lies with the villains, and Flying Swords boasts a memorable number of them. Chen Kun's Yu Hua Tian has in possession the title Flying Swords that brings back the hey days where gimmicky weapons are the order of the day in swordfighting films, and is himself an adversary who knows no mercy. His double role here makes this almost like a Chen Kun starrer, and a well deserved one for the performance put in as characters on either side of the fence. His cronies too are as bad as bad can be, and are exponents in their own right, with Fan Siu Wong as the masked Ma Jing Liang, and the Western Bureau second in command Tan Lu Zi (Sheng Jian) who unfortunately gets outfoxed most of the time.As a martial arts film, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate has enough variance in its fighting stances and styles, and to exploit 3D, naturally has stocked up on its flying dagger numbers to provide for those throw-toward-the-screen moments. It's quite hit and miss here, as some effects were wondrously too rich and too artificial that takes you out of the movie and may look more in place in a science fiction film instead, while others are done just right to blend in with the period surroundings. With a number of Chinese films these days just slapping on special effects like it was butter on bread (Culprits being films like Legendary Amazons, The Sorcerer and White Snake which also starred Jet Li, and just about every period flick coming out in the last year or two), this one may have to convince those who are turned off by the earlier shoddy productions. Tsui Hark continues to reinvent himself with each technological leap, with his Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain (1983, not the 2001 monstrosity), the Once Upon a Time in China series, and now with Detective Dee leading the charge and sealing the deal for his comeback, Flying Swords may just be that magic ticket Tsui Hark needs to re-establish himself as one of the greats in Asian cinema after a woeful past decade. It may not be an instant classic, but Flying Swords does have the necessary ingredients to make it amongst the game changing tent- poles of the genre."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"FLYING SWORDS OF DRAGON GATE is a pseudo follow-up to the Tsui Hark-produced NEW DRAGON GATE INN, with Hark now stepping into the directorial role. Sadly, it seems to have been made as an excuse to throw as many 3D effects at the screen as is humanly possible, in the form of CGI swords, weapons, wooden beams, explosions and anything else they can think of. The plot itself is a confused mess, with a mish-mash of rival characters meeting up at the famous Dragon Gate Inn and proceeding to slaughter each other. Most of the cast are stiff and underwritten, with the exception of the enjoyable Tartar characters, and Jet Li is the only notable presence here. The best scene is the bombastic opening which has a nice Gordon Liu cameo, but it quickly goes downhill from that point. The rest is overlong, cliched, predictable and messy, a frenetic mess of a film guaranteed to induce a headache and little else."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Raymond Lee is credited as the director of one of my favourite Hong Kong Wuxia film NEW DRAGON GATE INN (1992, a 9/10), but the real puppeteer is the producer Hark Tsui, the godfather figure in the heyday of Hong Kong Kung Fu sensation during 80s and 90s. So nearly 20 years later, when he decided to make a sequel of the original film, with a pristine cast (top- billed by Jet Li, Xun Zhou, Kun Chen and an assemblage of domestic celebrities from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan), my expectation was quite high (as I rarely watch any Chinese films now), also Tsui's previous detective-action big-budgeted vehicle DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME (2010, a 7/10) has somewhat rescued him from his career ennui since the millennium, so god forgives me if I hadn't prepared for the worst, and this film is an utter disaster. The storyline has never been at least fluent enough to let the audience know what is happening and the reactions ignited by various plots are beyond any possible interrelations, so at most 45 minutes later, I cannot care less about the story and I believe I am not the only one. The cast is quite awful, Jet Li is too old to resurrect Tony Leung Ka Fai's original role and Li is literally only 5 years younger, so basically it's just a strategy for the sake of the action part, and every earth man knows Li is not a talented actor besides his Chinese Kung Fu. So as gifted as Xun Zhou, their emotional interaction is for naught. The only saving grace if one must pick is Kun Chen, who has two different roles (including the unexplained doppelgänger in the dramatis personae), at least leaves some vague impression in the shattered hotchpotch of direly fake CGI effects in the desert, a treasure-hunting chicanery and many other ridiculous and incoherent twists.Gosh, I have already dwindled my quota of Chinese films each year to the maximum of 5, and this megalomaniac film could have successfully grabbed tons of money in the box office during the Spring Festival season does baffle me so much, is the market really so parched that poor audience would simply take anything would quench their thirst no matter how illogically laughable the quality. I feel so worried and upset towards the future of Chinese film ground, the scale of cinemas is enlarging day by day but basically is where tasteless garbages consecutively reside."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I watched this in 3-D and have to say it was worth it. There are some amazing effects on display here. Something even the critics will not deny the movie. What they will say of course is, that the movie is a bit of a mess when it comes to the plot/story department. And that accusation is not wrong. It's the visuals Tsui Hark is most concerned about. Which means you get more than a handful beautiful staged and choreographed scenes and sequences.But the story isn't that bad and though bumpy, still easy to follow. Not many will criticize Michael Bay or any other Hollywood director for their focus on the technical aspect rather than the development of plot and character. This still is superior in the character department, even though it has some major flaws there too.Still, if you want a good time with an enjoyable Eastern you could pick worse movies."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate must be watched in stereoscopic 3D to be properly appreciated. Its abundant visual spectacle is so clearly tuned for 3D that watching the film in anything less would mean you're not watching the real film at all. In 2D, the CGI backgrounds & objects are distractingly bad, robbing many scenes of their drama and gravitas. But in 3D, somehow it all works and you're transported into a vibrant, gorgeous world delivered with maximum visual panache.If can watch this film in 3D (it's not hard -- Your smartphone & a Google Cardboard VR headset will give you full brightness 3D that's brighter than the cinema's 3D!), then this is a must see. If you can't, then don't even bother with this film."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Jet Lee did some great stuff over the years. This is not one of those. Plot is worse than Disney.Entire movie has 0 decent martial art choreography. This is NOT a martial arts movie! What it is, is nonstop unrealistically stupid, badly done, CGI.Part I hated the most is that there is better flow of moves in Batman Origins Video Game than in this movie. Good for Batman Origins, very, very bad for unmemorable Dragon Gate.These is far too much posing, stopping, pausing, centering on badly acted facial expressions ... I really do not like Anime, so maybe that is part of the problem here, but this thing felt like C-budget Live Action Anime Roleplay by fans who are not really actors and have no professional experience."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Following Dragon Inn this film takes visual effects so freaking far that they overshadow and ruin the majority of all fights scenes in the movie. I love movies like House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and classics like Enter the Dragon. This has none of the redeeming qualities of those movies. I watched this mainly because of Jet Li's presence in the cast, and sadly that didn't help. His fights are also injected with too much CGI, and over done wire effects. I would have hoped he would pick a better film to make his return into wushu epics. I will go watch Hero or Fearless now to wipe my mind of this general bs. Overall 5/10 and I will, sad to say, not be buying this on bluray or DVD. What a disappointment."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"This movie is directed by the legendary Tsui Hark, features one of my favourite actors with Jet Li and is about Chinese legends and myths. This sounds quite promising but the final result is only of an average quality and therefor rather disappointing.The main problem is that Tsui Hark and Jet Li have become older but especially the director forgot to progress. He still does his movies the same way he did it in the late eighties or in the early nineties when they became international blockbusters. This style simply fails to impress nowadays. The choreographies are still bombastic and detailed but they feel even more exaggerated and artificial than usual because this movie is completely overloaded with special CGI effects. Jet Li has also become older and doesn't do the impressive fighting scenes he did in the past. He is quite underused in this flick.All these things wouldn't be so bad if Jet Li incarnated a good character. In movies such as ""Fearless"", he proved that he is not only an excellent fighter but also a credible actor. If Tsui Hark had created an intriguing story, the high amount of effects wouldn't have harmed this movie. That's what the main problem is. The movie includes no interesting story line and is rather confusing. The story is very tough to follow because there are many impostors and conspiracies going on which would normally be interesting but as the amount of intrigues is too elevated, the formula simply doesn't work and one gets quite mixed up in the end. A few potentially interesting characters play only minor roles such as the Tartars while I feel almost no empathy with the main actors. Jet Li's acting remains faceless and if there are a few good actors in this film, then these are the female ones such as Xun Zhou and especially Gwei Lun-Mei.Both Tsui Hark and Jet Li must though change their styles and skills to still create stunning movies these years. Both deliver a rather lukewarm performance and can't convince. The movie kicks off with a few interesting scenes and special effects but as soon as the story takes places in the desert tavern, the movie gets worse. The effects in the final third of the film are overwhelming and unnecessary and make the whole thing rather hard to sit through as it feels like a cheesy Walt Disney production. Any fan of both the main actor and the director should go for the original movies and ignore this one. The People's Republic of China seems to do the same mistakes as Hollywood these days and invests in useless remakes and sequels instead of focusing on fresh stories which I simply can't support as the originals were way better and innovating for their time. This here is for true fans only."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is exactly how to make use of 3D technology. Apart from James Cameron's Avatar, the use of 3D has been mostly disappointing. Innovative director Tsui Harks does it again and exceeds all expectations in delivering not only a great movie, but uses 3D to maximum effect. In a reunion of sorts, Jet Li teams up with Tsui Hark for the first time since the Once Upon a Time in China days. After the staggeringly excellent Detective Dee's last year, Hark continues his great form by bringing the audience into his imaginary world with 3 times the realism and some stunning special effects. Every inch of the budget seems to be perfectly used and the action direction is top class. The use of daggers, flying swords and martial arts display are all perfectly aided by the 3D effects. It is rare that a remake/re-imagination of an all time classic New Dragon Gate (1991) can be out-dux, but Hark achieves the impossible by delivering the most impressive and creative Hong Kong movie of the year. Although Jet Li seems wasted in a role that is far too limited for both his acting and martial arts abilities, Zhou Xun impresses in a role that requires little, but crucial to the movie. Chen Kun once again impresses in a duo role and Taiwanese Kwai Lun-mei adds some flair and style. However, if there is one big flaw in the film, it is the lack of chemistry between Li and Zhou. Then again, it is probably truism by now that Li rarely strikes up chemistry with co-stars and with Rosamund Kwan (Once Upon a Time in China series) out of the game, it is hard to see which actress can bring down his romantic defenses.Still, Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is more than a stellar effort and qualifies as true Asian Blockbuster of the year. It is the kind of movie that will bring the people back to the cinemas. All in all, it is probably an understatement to call Tsui Hark a genius, but just when all his Hollywood count parts fails to understand 3D technology, Hark steps up and above his peers and deliver a sucker punch of a movie. Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is not just a good movie, but it is a great movie on all levels. It is what you call a unique movie experience that brings in the world of Wuxia to the maximum effect. I am proud of Tsui Hark's achievements and after watching Flying Swords of Dragon Gate, he too should be proud of himself. Simply the film to beat in 2011 Neo rates it 9.5/10"
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"During China's Ming Dynasty his eunuchs have assumed considerable power with one running the East and West Bureaus which act as spies and the nations strict police; they also don't want the emperor to know that they are corrupt. During an operation to crack down on those who would expose them the head of the East Bureau is killed by Zhao Huai'an. Meanwhile the emperor's chief concubine has had the West Bureau execute three courtesans who got pregnant and ordered them to hunt down a fourth. This fourth one is about to be killed but is rescued by somebody claiming to be Zhao Huai'an; this is witnessed by the real Zhao. The fake Zhao and the courtesan head to the Dragon Gate in where they hope to wait out an approaching sandstorm. There are many others there drawn by a legend which says that a city, with lots of treasure, will be uncovered during such a sandstorm. By the time the storm arrives the West Bureau has arrived, there is also a man who looks almost identical to its leader; a group of Mongols and various bandits conflict is inevitable and when it comes things get confusing at times.As this film got underway I quickly prepared to be disappointed as the opening scene featured some very obvious CGI thankfully after that things improved somewhat and the effects towards the end where much better. The story was a little confusing at times with a large cast of characters, some of whom look identical ultimately this doesn't matter too much as we can tell who the main characters are except when there is deliberate confusion. There is plenty of solid action which fans of Wuxia style fighting are likely to enjoy. The cast, which includes Jet Li, does a fine job. Overall this isn't a classic of the genre but it is still well worth watching.These comments are based on watching the film in Mandarin with English subtitles; an English dub is also available but I can't comment on its quality."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Review: I really tried my utmost to understand what the hell was going on in this movie but the director kept on introducing new characters who belonged to different clans. On top of that, the characters kept on throwing up all these different names so it was hard to work out who was who. On the plus side, the production looked impressive and you could tell that there was quite a bit of money spent on some of the scenes, but I couldn't take the flying on strings, action scenes along with the crazy sword fights which went way over the top. Personally, I might have enjoyed it more if I knew what was going on, but I found it way to confusing and I lost the plot near the beginning. Disappointing!Round-Up: Jet Li is quite an impressive actor because he does his own stunts and he has an unique fast fighting style, but his performances aren't that emotional and some of his choice of films are really strange. He isn't in the same category as Jackie Chan because of his earlier contribution to Asian cinema, but there yet to find someone with the charisma and martial arts skills like Bruce Lee. I suppose it's like people like Bob Marley who really can't me imitated. Anyway, I really did have high hopes for this film, but I got totally let down because of the confusing storyline and unrealistic action scenes.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $100millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a clan, fighting against evil doers to save some hidden treasure from getting in the wrong hands. 2/10"
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Usually Tsui Hark does a good job in directing action movies, but it seems that he tried to bite off a bit too much off the cake with this particular project. Why? Well, because the movie in its striving to be an epic swordsman's tale, just turned out to be a mediocre story that wanted to accomplish too much and delivered very little.This is a wire-fu movie in all of wire-fu's glory. Is that bad? Well, not necessarily, however, the extended usage of the wires in the movie ended up being a bit too much as people were constantly in the air and all over the place. It just seemed too strained.The fighting and martial arts was right on the spot, though. Thumbs up on that part. They managed to pull that off quite nicely. However, and yes there is a however here as well, there was just too many weapons breaking into pieces and flying all over the place, but miraculously most people were able to parry all these projectiles. Again, it ended up being too much and too forced. Personally, I ended up being irritated at this, as just about every person in the movie was a martial arts 'superhero' of sorts, capable of performing grand stunts or blurring maneuvers with weapons.Story-wise, then ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"" wasn't overly impressive. The story was easy enough to follow, but Tsui Hark tried to implement a bit too many angles on the story, adding too many different elements of people with various backgrounds and reasons for being at the inn. Which ultimately, and sadly, turned out to be a little bit of a jumpy and not overly continuously well-told storyline.As for the people hired to portray the various roles, then they had managed to put together a rather good ensemble of Chinese cast. There were some good performances, both acting-wise and martial arts-wise.If you enjoy these Chinese tall stories of epic battles, sword fights and martial arts, then you might find some enjoyment in ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"", although I will say that there are far better and more impressive movies out there in the same genre. This is not Tsui Hark's best work, far from it actually."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I find this film much better than the original. In the original the fights were too weak and fake. Here the fights have more power, although the one in the Cyclone was weakened by not so good special effects. Still I must completely disagree with a reviewer who almost destroyed this movie with his comment about too many special effects. ""Thanks"" to him I was imagining something terrible and I am glad to have watched the film! I think who saw the ""New Dragon Inn"" will enjoy this film more, because he will know some of the story, and of the Characters. There are better films of course, but this is a good movie and absolutely deserves to be watched, if you like intrigue and martial arts. Characters are good, the plot is not great but IMO better than in the original, and the style of fights, even if not the best, is for me better than in the original, because more appropriate to what I started to like since when I watched Hero. I would give it 7.5 if I could."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I don't think I've ever watched two martial arts movies in a row until the other day, and by some strange cosmic coincidence, they were both Hark Tsui films. Well, maybe not that strange because I called them up after watching the trailers for both on a DVD, and they both arrived at the same time. The other film in question was ""Detective Dee: Mystery of the Phantom Flame"", which I found to have a fairly original story line and some exceptional stunt work. Other reviewers on this board called it hard to follow and a mess in general, which I took exception to because it wasn't that difficult if you paid attention. Well now the shoe is on the other foot, and even though I paid attention, I have to say that the story for me started off with one idea (the hunt for pregnant Su Huirong (Mavis Fan), and wound up supporting an entirely different one, (the search for the Xixia treasure gold). That much I followed, but it wasn't easy considering the large cast of characters, many of whom resembled each other, which tended to confuse who was who as the story progressed. Besides, there was so much going on in the way of action sequences and fighting that it took away from the main story. I did stick it out till the end of the picture, but quite honestly, by the time it got to the finish line, I was more than willing to take the advice of Chang Xiaowen (Lun-Mei Kwei), who stated quite succinctly, ""Well, it's hopeless, let's go""."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I enjoyed this movie right from the start with the huge sweep of the camera through the docks and swooping right into the action as Jet Li's character bursts into the assembly of extravagantly dressed officials. It's a long story, with a sort of Lara Croft like finale, and spectacular action scenes, at least 2 lookalike characters, and a love story on the way. You might want to watch it a second time so you can fully understand who's who, but I reckon thus is a masterpiece."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Maybe I gave Seven Swords too high of a score after seeing this one.This one is leaning towards a smart sardonic thriller then a wuxai epic - is Tsui Hark going the more subtle route now? There are the obvious and not so obvious twists. The hidden agenda behind an hidden identity. The what you think they know and what you think they know you know kind of stuff. Sometimes each interlude and detail plays out more like a setup to a joke - most of the time dry, sometimes a bit overdone.So maybe the writing is deserving more applause. The 3D not so much a distraction then a tool. But yet it feels like Tsui Hark old school humour (that is kind of charming if done right).There are hidden back stories (good they don't try to explain everything). But some are hurried along like the initial setup of East wing vs West wing.The meat in the middle where all it's happening inside the hostel for me is the gem. Everyone is careful, waiting for the wrong move, a flaw, a signal, a sign. The tension is nice.The ending CG extravaganza is a formality to the bacon double cheese burger --> to fill you up so it ""seems"" it is worth the cost. But still I bought it."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Famed Asian director Tsui Hark known for the Once Upon Time China series and his most recent Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame returns with an all-new remake/reimagining of the Dragon Inn series with Flying Swords of Dragon Gate. This film not only features Hark bringing back the famed wuxia style, superstar Jet Li and is the first wuxia film shot entirely in 3D.Flying Sword is set three years after Dragon Inn and the original owner Jade has disappeared and in her place a band of marauders disguised as citizens in hopes to find a fabled lost city. This was a great entry into this genre of martial arts filmmaking. The sets and visuals are as epic as every taking you into the world just like those that came before it. The story is fairly straight forward and not as nearly convoluted as most in this genre, but does a have a few moments here and there that veer off on an unstable path, but return with little confusion. The cast all do a great job bringing their characters to life and delivering the needed action to make this film work. Much like the original Dragon Inn films in 1992 this hearkens back to the time of over the top wild and crazy action that works on every level. This film sports some of the best martial arts action of this genre in sometime. Somewhere it seemed like they forgot how much fun and great these films were, but thankfully Hark is bringing it back. While not getting the chance to witness the 3D in action, it is clear from the way this movie is shot that they took full advantage of it. It easily enhanced the 2D version making it more intriguing and fun while never being distracting.For all those bummed about Jet Li's minimal return in Expendables 2, this is a welcomed replacement to get your Li fix. He is in top form reminding everyone where he came from and why we love him so much. As if this great film wasn't enough as is, there is even a cameo by the legendary martial arts icon Gordon Liu that will make old school fans of this genre smile. If you like Li or these old school style martial arts films, you have to check this film out, you will not be disappointed.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"As an admission I only watched the 2D version but I don't think an extra dimension is going to add to the story?I love Jet Li, even more his fantasy films but this one is awful and for some reason even though he is Chinese, the film makers dubbed his voice.Hark has failed where Hark rarely does and to do so with Li is inexcusable."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"The first of Tsui's wuxai epics I have seen. Has a very gripping plot with twists you can see happening and some that come out of nowhere leaving you thinking ""I didn't see that coming."" I personally loved how the plot came about and left the viewer surprised, a popular review mentions that the film failed to use it's best asset in Jet Li. I disagree mightily, Epics in general are about the grand story and not the over saturation of a single character.If anything (while I admit I have not seen others in the Dragon Inn series) I felt the story wasn't quite big enough. Especially with how the opening scene led you to believe it was going. It could have also done with a slight bit more character development.The action scenes were amazing, definitely no complaints there. I felt that one in particular near the ending was a bit over the top, but Tsui was lured into using 3D technology as much as possible.Xun Zhao gave the best acting performance and stood out for her strong delivery and dry persona that told the story of her character. She was also able to display other emotions well when the time was needed. Very solid performance from her.Kwan Lun-Mei was also very effective in her role as the Tatar leader and displayed a cool dark screen presence. Overall, I rated the movie very high as it was intelligent and had some suspenseful elements that spoke to the story telling which is saying quite a bit as it still had a bit of room for improvement.True Score: 8.1"
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"I don't like the style, the effects are not special, I prefer ""The Legend of the Chinese Master""... I didn't like it..."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"a movie not to be missed because of the action sequences, slick editing means no gap in the action, not too many dialogs to keep u bored kept me engrossed, didn't touch the fast forward button even once, forgot to even eat my ice cream, a surprise ending which took me completely off guard because i never expected it at the climax stage, a captivating storyline with enough characters thrown in to confuse yet not let you down with there involvement towards the theme of the movie, the fight scene in the dust storm is a treat to see, in any case watching jet li do his stuff is good enough but in here the girls were good with the action as was the villain dude and his second in command, the extra wide scenery captured of desert and water flow at the same time was awesome. all in all a film worth commenting on and reviewing- which is a first for me."
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Well, I do like this kind of movie.The good: the 3D is really quite good, though a little inconsistent. Sometimes lots of the scene is in focus, other times less of it, for no real reason. I think that the scenes with really good 3D were maybe CGI as well?The so-so: The plot was hard to follow, with cross, double cross and triple cross, and the impostor characters. Also the female character with the tattoos on her face, every time she spoke the subtitles said (tartar), whatever that meantThe bad: so much CGI. CGI ships, landscapes, clouds, sand. Hard to know what was filmed in the real world.Summary: you have to be a real fan to buy this.Funny thing: I gave this a 7 before starting to type the review, but I've talked myself into reducing it to a 6"
龙门飞甲,Flying Swords of Dragon Gate (2011),,2011,2012.08.30,"Complete trash story and cgi with zero sense of realism. You would be highly disappointed if you expect this to be a martial arts movie, its more like a sci fi action overloaded with dodgy cgi, highly unrealistic scenes and action, which is a complete waste of actors and talents. The old movie new dragon inn was ten times better with solid action and realistic scenes."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The style of the movie immediately brings to memory Kung-Fu Hustle, also written and directed by Stephen Chow, but its target is a reinvention of the Journey to the West story.Unfortunately, much of the symbolism used in the film is lost on me, since I know nothing of Chinese mythology. I am sure much of the characters and word games that I suppose mean a lot to a Chinese person, to me are just wacky and incomprehensible. That being said, the film is very nicely done, combining drama and comedy in a way that is mostly foreign to western cinema, good acting and cool special effects.I have to admit that the movie makes me want to read some translation of Journey to the West, one of the Four Great Classical Novels, so, if that was Chow's purpose, the film is a success. I also have to admit that I liked the movie, considering whether to keep it for later viewing or not. As such, it is clearly above average, but the nagging feeling that a lot got lost in translation makes me rate it only so: above average."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The funniest man in the cinematic world (Stephen Chow Sing Chi) stays behind the camera (unfortunately) as writer and director for this epic and hilarious retread of his amazing films; A Chinese Odyssey 1 & 2.That said, and as a fan of Zhang Wen (which has grown more so after seeing this), the film is a solid Chi film that is worthy of a place in any fans collection!With dark humour akin to that of 'From Beijing With Love' and others, the comedy elements are fast and clever, matched by the tense moments of horror that sometimes even left me (a fan of HK cinema for over 30 years), with my mouth open.But it was awesome!!Journey To The West: Conquering The Demons is a hit. Its also great to see Shu Qi in an ass kicking hilarious role which I think suits her much better than the serious dramas. Lets hope there will be a few sequels spawning from this, and all being well, a return in front of the camera for the incredible Chow Sing Chi!!"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Truth be told, I wasn't quite impressed with the idea that Stephen Chow had to revisit one of his greatest films, and do another version of it. But Chow had proved me wrong, and had some nifty creative ideas behind what he had wanted to do with another Journey to the West tale, hardly rehashing the earlier Jeff Lau effort. He had managed to keep the strengths of what he is well known for in irreverent comedy, and crafted his best in years, while coming up with yet another new spin to keep things engaging even for the most jaded amongst us on the tale of Monkey King. The trailer, while keeping things really short, now on hindsight was a brilliant little piece of a short prologue, while teasing the audience on a Monkey King appearance that's never been portrayed nor seen before in this form, which does take some getting used to.But this film, co-directed with Derek Kwok, sets its sights on Tripitaka the monk, or Xuan Zang, instead, before he got preordained into monk-hood. In this re-telling, Xuan Zang (Wen Zhang) is a novice demon-hunter, and a hopeless one at that. He believes that every demon should be shown compassion, and is for non-violence as much as possible, in order to rehabilitate demons that he found, using his book of nursery rhymes which his master claims to be one of the best sutras around for subduing of spirits. Xuan Zang embodies all that is benevolent, consistent in spirit (pardon the pun) what you know of the character, except that he has that thick mop of hair. But despite his lack of skills other than a stout heart, help comes in the form of Ms Duan (Shu Qi), the expertly skilled demon hunter, with her own posse to allow some cameo appearances, who has the hots for Xuan Zang (again playing to the tune that he is someone desirable, as any Journey story goes), and pops up almost always at the right time to save his hide.Elements from Journey stories include the individual encounters with all his disciples and their tweaked back stories, which credit has to be given to the screenwriters for improvements that worked within the confines of this alternate story they wanted to tell. The highlight is of course how Xuan Zang's first meeting with Sun Wukong (Huang Bo) went, which is as comical and witty as can be, which extended to the big battle finale that had as much heart, a key winning element from Chow's A Chinese Odyssey films, to move when themed against the notion of sacrifice. The final twenty minutes was a fitting climax, building up upon a series of very smart episodes, which included, on a higher level, how scriptures are based on love.And this romance between Xuan Zang and Ms Duan forms the crux of the story, like in A Chinese Odyssey, that drives the narrative forward. Shu Qi plays the much tomboyish demon hunter with aplomb, who has to dig deep to find her femininity in wooing Xuan Zang, and who would have guessed she looked so comfortable and credible in executing many of her martial arts scenes. Wen Zhang like others before him who have played the kind monk, was right at home with his performance, a little bumbling mixed with that tinge of innocence, and sheer determination in wanting to do good despite only having the best of intentions, and none of the skills. And amongst the other characters, all eyes are perhaps on Huang Bo's rendition of the Monkey King, which I can only say it's extremely different to begin with, and I'm sure some find the character design a little bit bewildering.Then again, it's a retelling, so some decisions made may not sit well with others, but I thought it was a breath of fresh air, especially since it's probably the first time (in a long while maybe) that it took the stance of all the disciples being enemy combatants and demons. I can't rave enough about the finale that dealt with how the Monkey King got that golden headband of his, as it touches on the virtues of love and forgiveness all in one fell swoop, conspicuously making the deities of Journey missing and unnecessary in this story.Chow as a director has somehow imparted his acting techniques from the many demeanours he had portrayed in the past, to probably each and every character here, so much so that everyone has shades of Chow's easily recognizable persona, especially when dealing with comic timing, and style. And like his recent lavish productions, this one is no different, which is full of CG effects, but polished and more of a tool to tell the story rather than drawing attention to themselves. But that doesn't mean that Chow has lost touch with his more humble beginnings, at times opting for practical gags that had served him well in the past, and low brow humour still ever-reliable in eliciting laughter.Given a subtitle in this film, one can only hope there's a follow up of sorts, because the baseline has been set, the origins told, and what lies ahead are the countless of episodes in the troupe's perilous journey westwards to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures, which anyone could be taken and given a new narrative spin in similar treatment as this one. Stephen Chow once again showed that he still has that creative flair and streak within him, that even if he doesn't appear in front of the camera, he has what he takes behind it to deliver the best of his hey-days. One of the best films out of this Lunar New Year season!"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"A great take on the classic Chinese legend, and director Stephen Chow does it with his usual finesse and sense of mixing up comedy with action.I must admit that I was a little bit skeptic at first, given the synopsis and the legend to which the movie is based upon. But with talents such as Stephen Chow behind the wheel, it just had to be experienced. And of course, also with the lovely Shu Qi in the movie it is not one to be missed.There is a good amount of action throughout the movie matched up with good choreographed fighting and wire stunts. But it all comes together for an enjoyable end result, which is what matters. And the comedy throughout the movie was great. If you enjoyed ""Kung Fu Soccer"" or ""Kung Fu Hustle"", then you will also enjoy ""Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons"", no doubt about it.The costumes and sets were great and really added a lot to the movie. But also hats off to the special effects team. They really managed to pull it off quite nicely, and these demons were quite interesting to look at, yet convincing enough to appear real. So thumbs up for that.There is a nice continuous flow to the movie, where the alternation between comedy, action and romance is a good change of pace and makes for a great roller-coaster experience.It should be said that ""Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons"" is the type of movie that you will only fully enjoy if you have an interest in Chinese cinema and more or less an interest in Chinese mythology.The cast was good, and there was a great chemistry between Shu Qi and Zhang Wen on the screen, both in a comedy way, but also during the action sequences.""Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons"" scores an easy 7 out of 10 stars from me."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Can any earnest Stephen Chow fan be blamed for eagerly anticipating his ""Journey to the West""? Aside from the fact that it marks his first movie in four years, it promises a return to the inimitable blend of slapstick comedy, kung fu and romance which Chow had so successfully parlayed into a winning formula in the duology ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part One – Pandora's Box"" and ""A Chinese Odyssey: Part Two – Cinderella"" – never mind that Chow does not reprise his role as the ""Monkey King"" or for that matter have any starring role in this new movie.Fortunately, Chow's fans can rest easy – despite not having any physical presence in the movie, this ""Journey"" is classic Chow from the acting to the writing and to the directing, the latter two roles of which he is credited for in addition to producing the movie. And perhaps the best news of it all is that Chow returns to the sheer inspired inanity and hilarity of ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"", so be prepared to be rib-tickled silly by the misadventures of Miss Duan (Shu Qi) and Xuan Zang (Zhang Wen) in demon country. Those familiar with the classic ""Journey to the West"" novel will know that Xuan Zang is also known as Tripitaka, who would be entrusted by Guanyin with the mission of recovering the sacred texts together with three disciples – Monkey King, Zhu Bajie and Sand Monk. Chow leaves that tale for the inevitable sequel; rather, in this movie, he fashions in essence a prequel, where Xuan Zang is no more than an amateur demon hunter yet to attain enlightenment, Monkey King or Sun Wukong (Huang Bo) is a conniving demon imprisoned in a cave by Buddha, Zhu Bajie is a pig demon called KL Hogg (Chen Bing Qiang) who especially kills women who lust after handsome men, and Sand Monk (Lee Sheung Qing) is a half-fish half-beast water demon who wrecks havoc on fishing communities living near the water.You'll do well to remember that each demon you see on screen is of significance; otherwise you may be wondering why the screenplay, credited to Chow and seven other writers seems to dwell too excessively on each particular demon-slaying encounter – beginning with Sand Monk, then KL Hogg and finally to Sun Wukong. Indeed, the movie is really made up of these three distinct sequences, with the exception of one more that builds on the budding romance between Xuan Zang and his much more skilled and experienced fellow demon hunter Miss Duan.Within that narrative structure, Chow constructs four elaborately staged battles that combine his brand of quirky humour, choreographer Ku Huen Chiu's imaginative action and production designer Bruce Yu's richly conceived sets with some truly impressive CGI that rivals anything you have seen so far in Chinese cinema. Thankfully, Chow doesn't get caught up with putting on the best visual effects show; in fact, with an inspired and confident directorial hand, he balances all these elements deftly, never forgetting that his audience is expecting nothing less than his signature brand of laughs. Right from the start, you'll know that Chow's comedic sensibilities are at his sharpest. He takes his time to set each scene – for instance, in the first sequence, a charlatan is seen tricking the villagers that a giant sting ray he had blasted dead in the water was responsible for one of their own's death, so much so that when the real culprit (i.e. the water demon) appears, that entrance is even more dramatic. Ditto for the appearance of KL Hogg and Sun Wukong, whose appearances in full glory are again preceded by red herrings that make the 'coming-out' more impactful.Chow again demonstrates an exceptional ability to juggle comedy and tragedy – here, in engineering humour amidst the deaths of others by the respective demons – and it is to his credit again that placing these two elements side by side in every sequence does not make the movie any tonally jarring at any point. And of course, as with all his films, this one features his unique brand of exaggerated slapstick - like the obscenely over-sized woman who comes to save the day (think ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""CJ7"") or the occasional gross joke that involves some inappropriate kissing – and his cheeky tendencies of confounding genre stereotypes.In place of his mug, Chow has found his proxy in the form of Mainland actor Zhang Wen. It is said that Chow shows his actors just how he expects them to act in every scene, and in the case of Zhang Wen, we are sure Chow must have showed Zhang the way he would have played the role himself. You can almost see Chow through Zhang's rubber-faced mannerisms - and the same goes for Huang Bo, who plays the mischievous Sun Wukong with more than a hint of Stephen Chow.Chow also fashions the love story between Zhang and Shu Qi the way he and co-star Athena Chu used to in the 'A Chinese Odyssey' films, and there are certain recognizable shades of similarities in the relationship between Xuan Zhang/ Miss Duan and Monkey King/ Zixia in the latter. Nonetheless, Shu Qi isn't simply a stand-in for Athena Chu – fearsome when fighting demons like an oriental Tomb Raider and yet amorous when it comes to romancing Xuan Zhang, she is thoroughly alluring from start to end in the very sexy and sassy manner we would expect from her.So really, there's little to worry even though you won't see Stephen Chow in the movie – every bit of it is quintessentially Chow. Like his 'A Chinese Odyssey' movies, this ""Journey"" has action, comedy, romance and the additional ingredient of CGI to ensure an alternately amusing and suspenseful and thrilling ride from start to finish."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The movie is a wonderful experience, for Buddhists and for the general public that is able to enjoy fantastic stories.It is about the first part of a very long story of the monkey god Wukong, a very powerful entity that used to annoy meditation practitioners at Buddha's time. The special effects are above average and the overall experience, too. There's a lot of action and funny moments, also. Nevertheless, I don't think that's a movie for children, after all. Please, don't listen to the bad reviews, they really aren't fit for this kind of movie. Enjoy, being or not a Buddhist."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons marks the very first Stephen Chow directed movie without him acting in it. So, what can I properly expect from this movie? The idea of a Stephen Chow movie is always exciting. However, I was concerned that it might be the start of an new era in which Stephen Chow will only direct movies and not act in them anymore. For that, I was both excited and scared to see this film. But finally, I decided there probably wasn't anything to expect and just walked in without expectations.Fortunately, that ended up being the best way to seeing this movie. I ended up being really surprised and taken away by it.It's clear that Stephen Chow's passions are now set into directing. He has improved a lot as a director; his films have become more cinematic experiences. There's less reliance on comedic dialogue, more emphasis on telling a story with stronger imagery, and has an improved sense of setup and payoff. He's much more interested in storytelling mechanics and more invested in where he can take an audience emotionally besides just laughs. With the way he structures some of his story, there's a symbiotic relationship between comedy and tragedy that he's very interested in exploring.Wen Zhang delivers that exact balance between tragedy and comedy in his performance as Xuanzang. He is a charismatic leading man and he shoulders the film with both its funny and heartbreaking moments. When he was playing for humor, I laughed. When he was crying, I found it moving. I am buying him at every moment and he was playing me like a squeeze toy. The story gives a genuine pathos as he becomes the Xuanzang we know from the story.Shu Qi is very affable in this role and it's nice to see her play a character with more cartoonish sensibilities. I especially liked her psychotic expressions when she was killing off demons. And yes, I can see how hard it is to reject Shu Qi if she threw herself at you like she did in this movie.Huang Bo is a fun Monkey King and makes a very engaging antagonist. This version of Monkey King is richly complex. It's an interesting take on the character because it highlights a key point about Sun Wukong that's often glossed over: He never had a choice to join Xuanzang on his journey to the west. The Monkey King goes only because he is tamed by the magical torture crown that's he is forced to wear on his head. In this interpretation, he's not completely good or evil. Huang Bo does not play it too over-the-top by enhancing the animalistic sensibilities. Instead, what really stuck with me was how he convincingly played the desperate pain of being trapped under a mountain for five centuries.The film's gags are executed with much discipline. The gags are zany but not random. They are all building character and moving the story forward each step of the way to it's final conclusion. It's masterful how Chow is able to use comedic moments to build towards moments of sadness and loss.The thought of no more Stephen Chow roles anymore aches me a bit but his presence is felt here. He has delivered a well-made film. Fortunately the film is done well enough to help me get over my aching and accept him now as only a film director. I look forward to seeing him continually improve as a storyteller and to the next installment in this series.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"An absolute breakthrough...! From the refreshingly inventive script (""X-MEN Origins"" of Pigsy, Sandy etc.), mind-boggling CGI, dazzling Kungfu, beautiful cinematography, belly-aching comedy (look out for the hilarious fish demon purification scene), to the evocative moment when your heart is touched and your eyes streaming wet; which explains why it broke China's box office records, reaching USD$100 million (over RMB$0.6 billion) in 8 days (the fastest ever), and taking in USD$12.5 million (RMB$78 million) on the opening day alone (another first).Stephen Chow has been honing his skill as a highly specialized film-maker par excellence, notably with Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle, CJ7 and now Journey to the West - Conquering the Demons; injecting photo-realistic CGIs, comic innovations and content with a moral thread. Speaking of which, the key message that loving-kindness (Metta / Ci Ai / Universal Love) for all sentient beings is a transcendental quality that ultimately conquers ignorance, ego and hatred is conveyed pretty succinctly.*Having watched it in both 2D and 3D, I must say that the stereoscopic version certainly heightened the virtual realism that gave James Cameron's Avatar an extra oomph.The bad thing about this movie is - it leaves you hungry for even more, despite the running time being nearly 2 hours (110 min) in its cinematic version. Hopefully, Stephen Chow decides to produce a sequel, which would almost certainly need to feature a celestial dragon, perhaps like the magnificent one from Sam Neill's The Dragon Pearl.*See Dhammapada (Ancient Collection of Short Sayings by The Buddha) Verse 5 - Hatred is never appeased by hatred. It is appeased only by loving-kindness. This is a timeless law."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I saw the TV commercials and trailers and thought : what a piece of sh*t! Is this the kind of movie Stephen Chow, who directed and starred in Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle, CJ7, all good movies, is making now? Boy was I wrong. Never have I seen a movie trailer that I thought was sh*t and the movie turns out to be so much fun (except Robocop-but that's a classic on another level.). Stephen Chow had so smartly kept the good stuff out of the TV commercials. The movie far surpassed my expectations. I went to see it simply because of good word of mouth and it opened Huge. Also news was going around that this movie scared 6-8 year old children and made them cry in the theaters. Yes, there are parts of this movie that are intense, violent, bloody. Not what people expect from comedy king and family entertainment star Stephen Chow. But there are also children laughing. So warning : not suitable for kids under... 10 ? PG? PG13?This looks and feel like a good old Hong Kong movie. I love it. Sadly, the once exciting Hong Kong movie industry is a shadow of it's former self. With most productions moving to China now.Stephen Chow unfortunately does not appear in this movie at all. He directed, worked on the screenplay and co-produced it. Had a younger Chow starred as the male lead this movie would have been even better. Shu Qi is pretty as always and the entire cast is good.The classic story of Journey to the West is given a new twist. In the hundreds years old story the Monkey King was imprisoned by Bhuddha for wreaking havoc in heaven. He must seek redemption with Piggy, Sandy monk to help Tang Seng on his journey to seek enlightenment. I won't give away the story of this movie. But I will say that I was very satisfied and that if you like Hong Kong movies or Stephen Chow's movie, you must go to the theater to see it. Also the 3D stereoscopic effects were well done. I might add that the Monkey King in the movie is not what most people expect but not untrue to literature. He's been trapped 500 years and he's mad as hell ! The Taiwanese actor that played him is the best in the movie. He played every nuance. Also Monkey King only change to one other form despite having the ability to change to 72 forms in the book(not including human form). For once I think a good dubbing is actually better than subtitles because there is so much going on in the screen and reading the subtitles takes your eyes away from the action. This movie deserves(and probably will get) a USA (or worldwide) theatrical release."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Fortunately, the movie packs Stephen Chow's comedic style, or I would call it contains his soul. There's Chow's usual style of comedy, action, love story, and some meaning behind life. Well, what more is needed in a blockbuster movie? Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I went into the cinema without any expectation, and I didn't read any reviews so I could enjoy the whole movie as if I was the first to do so. I understand that Chow directed this movie, and even demonstrated to retain the ""feel"" of his usual style. Still, I find the first 15 minutes of the movie to be a little dry in terms of humor. As the protagonist enters the scene it was a bit difficult for me to laugh. However, as the story unfolds, and as the mainstream humor pours in, laughter floods the cinema wave after another. To add, the protagonist's wacky hair style, does resemble Chow in some ways.The CGI is of top quality, I can see the movie spending a lot of money on CGI. Many of the scenes contain a lot of visual detail and picturesque grounds. The music is familiar and lovely, I shall not reveal too much.Show Luo's appearance in this movie was like his usual funny-self in his TV entertainment news. I would appreciate it more if he would have neglected his usual style and adopted a new one. It's not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing too, it lies somewhere on the neutral side. I guess on the good side, his fans will love to see him.Trying my best not to disclose too much. This movie is a prequel to his previous 2 part movie, ""A Chinese Odyssey Part One: Pandora's Box, and A Chinese Odyssey Part Two: Cinderella."" The essence of this movie is how it somehow relates to ""A Chinese Odyssey"" in terms of how life is, in its cycle. The feelings the protagonist experienced in this movie is similar to what his disciple experienced in ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The good news for those who haven't seen ""A Chinese Odyssey"", is that you can watch this movie on its own.Lastly, there are some tear-jerking scenes. My eyes welled up at some parts, but I stayed a man. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10 because of its imperfection, but the scores only allow whole numbers. So.... enjoy the movie."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I enjoyed this thoroughly. It is well acted, scripted and the costuming is great. All the settings were visually engaging and the action scenes were well thought out and wonderful to watch. I love movies that are vibrant, giving the viewer a reason to keep watching the screen. Check this out it was amazing."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Kung Fu Hustle was a smash hit and also a brilliant and funny film so it resonated with Eastern and Western audiences. This set high expectations for 'Journey' which unfortunately it can't meet. We get a very action oriented fairy tale with demons and demon hunters caught in epic battles combined with some Budha nonsense. And these battles are pretty good actually, though the VFX are clearly not up to the modern day standards (they were done by a Chinese VFX company). The biggest problem is the comedy which doesn't work as well as in Kung Fu Hustle. Journey is a good film but it could have been a classic with some more polishing on the production (VFX) and comedy side. In the West nobody probably ever heard of this film but in China it made 213m$ and they're already building a theme park. Quite possible we could get a sequel."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,This story goes around two demon hunters with two different hunting styles falling in love with each other but unable to find love as Tang is more determined towards ending evil. Tang is of the opinion of reforming the evil with the use of his nursery rhythms. But things move the other way round when they encounter a powerful demon. Buddha comes to the rescue and helps reform the demons. This is a good fantasy especially on its philosophical part. Comedy is average and fighting sequence meets the expected lines. Overall good to watch.
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"About a week ago I watched Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons, and aspects of it are still indelibly imprinted on my brain. More than anything it was the fact that this was the first time in ages that I found myself laughing to the point that I was gasping for air. I laughed so hard that my face hurt when watching this movie. There's one scene in particular that nailed the comedy so well, I actually told my wife about it days later because I found it so funny. I've often said that comedy is one of the genres that suffers the most during the pandemic because being in a crowded theater where everyone is laughing can make humor more powerful. There's an infectious nature to laughter that makes it a better group experience. So, it takes a truly hilarious film for me to openly laugh when I am sitting home alone. That's how impressive it is that I nearly made myself sick with laughter a few times while watching Journey to the West. It was that good.However, like all the greatest comedy films, you can't just ride on jokes. You need a plot to give structure and context to the comedic moments. That's another area where I felt Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons excelled. This movie has a fun story about gifted people who roam the country looking for demons who have assumed human form that they can capture. I found it quite interesting the variety of different demon hunters we meet along the way, and it was cool to see their different fighting styles. In some of those fight scenes it reminded me of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and it was fun to see how they would wield their powers to take down the big bad with unique flair. I also found it great that they maintain high stakes in this film, because the demons aren't just hollow threats. These monsters genuinely murder people, and it makes it easy to root for them to be taken down.If I had one thing I could nitpick about Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons it would be the CGI. It's not great, and you can often see the seams between what is real and what was added in post. Yet that never seemed to bother me. Perhaps because the film has an undercurrent of comedy, I didn't find myself expecting as much from the CGI. There's an exaggerated, and almost humorous look to the monsters that works to make them menacing but not scary. I suppose I could gripe about certain aspects of the ending, but I kind of enjoyed the way it sought to play on the emotions of the audience. I don't think that humor has to be completely separated from things like sadness in a good story. Those valleys can feel even more impactful when you've reached such heights before them. At this point, I don't think it's much of a secret that I genuinely loved Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. This is a movie that worked in every way for me, and one I hope to own so I can revisit it multiple times in the future."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Perhaps the funniest and best Chinese movie I have seen is Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer. The film is thoroughly weird but also a laugh riot from start to finish. I also liked his Kung Fu Hustle. So, when I was offered a chance to see his film, Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons I was excitedvery excited. Sadly, while it is quite weird (which I appreciate), I was surprised that it just wasn't consistently funny. Still, even a disappointing film by Chow is worth a look.To fully appreciate the film, it would help if you have some familiarity with Chinese classical literature. In this film, one of the main characters is the Monkey King (also known as Sun Wukong)—one of the characters in the super-famous Chinese novel Journey to the West. Much of the way he's portrayed in the film is actually based on this story strange as it might seem! He has amazing magical powers and strength and was imprisoned for 500 years due to his hubris for challenging the gods. However, although I mentioned the Monkey King, the main character in this story is a very well meaning but totally inept demon hunter, Tang Sanzang. Again and again, Tang takes on demons—only to have his butt whipped and he always ends up getting rescued by Miss Duan—a real and amazingly talented demon hunter! Inexplicably, Miss Duan is infatuated with Tang—even though he pretty much looks like a hobo and doesn't reciprocate this love. Tang is like a monk in his devotion to his art and shuns all romance and affection. Eventually, however, the pair end up facing the formidable Monkey King—and their relationship is seriously tested and the pair are brought together.The film really excels when it comes to its production values. Clearly, the Chinese can equal the best stuff coming from Hollywood with this film. It features stunning CGI, gorgeous music and simply looks breathtaking. Because of this, it is worth seeing just to see scenes such as the final epic battle between the Buddha and the Monkey King! As far as the weirdness goes, this film truly is strange. I would talk specifically about some of the weird demons Tang meets but I really think it's better to see them yourself! You WILL be amazed and some are absolutely insanely designed. But, unfortunately, unlike Shaolin Soccer, the film often drops the ball when it comes to combining this weirdness with laughs. Again and again, I found myself amazed but rarely amused. Now this isn't to say it's a bad film overall. But, compared to the best of Chow's work, it is a letdown. Oh, and if you are wondering, unlike these other two films I mentioned, Stephen Chow is not in this movie—he just directed, co-wrote and co-produced itbut that sure sounds like enough! This film is available from Netflix and if you have a Netflix account, it is currently available there as well."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"A movie directed by Stephen Chow always promises surreal effects, ludicrous and often bizarre humor, vague spirituality and sincere sentiment. This film delivers all of those, but the storytelling seriously slackens in the second half of the film. The effects are not up to par for ten years ago, although occasionally the lighting effects and scenery almost make up for the cheezy looking demons (the first demon, a giant fish, is the most impressive, and it goes downhill from there, like the rest of the film generally). There are moments of really great humor, but those fall fewer and further between as the film proceeds. The final conclusion features a silly but somehow fascinating version of the famous Monkey-King in an anti-climactic fight with a series of demon hunters, ended rather abruptly with a deus-ex-machina. Simply put, Chow's storytelling is dull here; maybe he was trying to stick too close to source material, maybe he was lazy, maybe he is confused, but something is really wrong with the ending.A few things worth noting.... Chow not seem to be aiming for a Western audience at all. Which is not necessarily good or bad, but worth noting. The conclusion offers nothing by way of diluting its heavy Buddhist-propaganda angle, the film features many situations and jokes that will not make sense to European or American audiences (what exactly was supposed to be funny about the ""Important Prince"" being told ""you should have asked us sooner"" over and over again?), and the perspective and style in general are tres tres Chinese. There are hints of homophobic humor that are not, as usual, alleviated by Chow's innate androgyny. This film reminded me of ""Forbidden City Cop"", and not in a good way. Immediately when he goes into the forest and gets trapped by the Demon Hunters, it was like a bad imitation of a much better film that Chow already made. The Demon Hunters' wagon is not a very amusing prop, their specialties are dull. However, the relationship between Miss Duan and Xuan Zang is very interesting. It manages to hold the film together to a great extent, although in the end it does not go anywhere particularly new.I wouldn't recommend this to anybody except hardcore Chow fans, and even these will be disappointed by the lack of cohesion, the lack of Kung Fu, and frankly by the lack of Stephen Chow himself. Chow is a wonderful actor who brings real humor and sentiment to his films; the director's own best asset is himself, and he's deprived himself (and us) here with this mediocre entry into the canon of Chinese mythlore depicted on screen. The first 20 or 30 minutes are very promising, but the film falls apart surprisingly quickly. Let's hope Chow can rebound with something that has a bit more appeal."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The Chinese mainland is troubled by angry demons, born from injustice and rage, vengeful spirits with supernatural powers. Enter the demon-hunters, a breed of almost superhuman warriors, all with special traits that make them worthy adversaries. Amongst these deadly fighters, who capture demons via their brute force, is the Buddhist apprentice Xuan Zang (Zhang Wen), whose weapon of preferred choice is a book of Nursery Rhymes, which appeal to the inner good laying dormant within each evil creature. However this course of action makes him a laughing stock amongst other demon hunters, amongst them Miss Duan (Qi Shu), whose eternally replicating bracelet make her a worthy adversary of any supernatural foe.Nonetheless Xuan Zang's inherent goodness and dedication to his beliefs, slowly earns him Duan's adoration, which Zang rebukes citing his focus on the Greatest Love. However Duan remains adamant to capture the love of the monk-fighter. Meanwhile a vicious pig-demon causes havoc, thus causing Zang to search out the aide of the Monkey King.A huge fan of Stephen Chow's earlier work I must admit that his newest feature has left me somewhat wanting. His requisite absurd humour remains present, but either the sense of novelty has whittled away, or the movie lacks the subtle mix of drama and lampoon comedy which made ""Shaolin Soccer"" or ""Kung Fu Hustle"" so memorable. Heavily Buddhist in its morality, Chow attempts to introduce the ridiculous, but struggles to replicate a cohesive atmosphere throughout the movie. It was still entertaining to view, but much like the family drama ""CJ7"", it left me wanting for a rewatch of his previous works. Often unfunny, even laborious, despite its multitude of intriguing concepts, ""Journey to the West"" is a half-hearted entertaining, but ultimately disappointing, addition to Stephen Chow's filmography.The CGI isn't always up to par, especially with regards to the animal monsters, who often seem like takeaways from the Sci-fi Channel."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"After the one-two punch of Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, I expected more great things from Stephen Chow. Instead, he made a middling children's film (CJ7 - it was lame, but it was, I admit, enormously popular in China) and then disappeared for several years. He finally emerged with this film, an adaptation of a very popular Chinese novel that has been adapted into several earlier movies and television series. It has a lot of what made Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle so special, in particular the bizarre humor. I did laugh a lot during this film. This one's a little too obsessed with special effects, though, and it really doesn't help that CGI effects have not evolved an iota since Kung Fu Hustle in Asia. The effects look absolutely awful here, for the most part, and, when that's the focus of your film, it's pretty much destined to fail. Well, ""fail"" is a bit too much, but, compared to Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, this is a big disappointment (I still liked it a tad more than CJ7). If you did like his earlier films, this is worth a look. It is fun at times. Zhang Wen takes the lead (he looks so much like Chow I thought it was him until the credits rolled; I guess he felt he was too old for the role). Shu Qi (Millennium Mambo, The Transporter) is as gorgeous as always as the demon hunting heroine who goofily falls for Zhang. I also really liked Bo Huang as the Monkey King."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I am a Stephan Chow fan. So much so that I would go gay for him BUT have an asexual realtionship with him. I just want to spend as much time with him as possible in a relationship without gay sex. I just want to see him come out of the shower wearing a bath robe, and shake his hand, and eat meals with him and tell him what a fan I am because I am, but this movie sucks. It just sucks because it's funny only in certain circumstances but then has no underlying great story to it. It's characters are all underdeveloped and I don't know much about them because their depth is kept very shallow. It's like Stephen Chow got bored one day and said ""I want to make a movie"" and wrote a script in 1-2-3. The most time consuming parts about making this movie must have been setting up the CGI, the costumes/sets, and getting the right contracts and what-not. Otherwise i felt with this movies writing it could have been shot on a shoe-string budget by a few friends with a hand-held camera and the will and determination to tell this story to others. It's not a bad story, but it gets lost in the elaborate special effects and small jokes every couple of minutes. It's fun to watch, don't get me wrong, but it's like a junk food that is too sweet and leads to an 'Ugh' feeling after a while. This movie was not satisfying for me, instead I had too many conflicting emotions in me. I was angry at the main character, angry at the female lead for being so persistent to get the MC to love her without a motive, and angry at the demons for not having a justification for their evil deeds. Every character should have a motive for doing what they do- even the bad guys, and in this case the bad guys didn't have one- the monkey king did- but even so he seemed more despicable than I would have liked him to be and I was not satisfied the direction this movie took with every character and it's overall story from the get-go. I would have told it so much differently and that is the mark of a bad movie/story in my opinion. A Chinese Odyssey is a much better movie/story than this."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"This movie begins with a brilliant, elaborately choreographed, consistently funny battle with a giant sea demon. It's the closest thing I've seen to the sensibility of Chow's Shaolin Soccer (I didn't really care for Kung Fu Hustle). It's a long scene, and since I'm going to be a bit critical of the rest of the movie, I want to say that this scene alone makes the movie worth watching.The movie continues in the same vein with another brilliant demon-fight scene involving the main, dopey guy character and a cool girl character who is a much better demon fighter. But then ...First off, the movie gets dumb. The girl demon fighter falls inexplicably in love with the dope and does the most ridiculous things possible to get his attention. It's a problem because she seemed so Dirty-Harry cool at first that it feels like they've turned her into someone else. Still, her inept wooing is pretty amusing. The movie ends with another big action scene, but this one uses bigger special effects to less effect, and at the same time becomes rather maudlin. It's really pretty eye-rolling by the end.At its best, this movie is absolutely wonderful, and at its worst, it's overly silly but somewhat amusing. I'm still waiting for Chow to make something as good as Shaolin Soccer, though."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Not knowing anything about this film, I watched in on a lark, expecting an action packed martial arts film What I got was an over the top satire with some mysticism thrown in.Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,Did u ever see gods of egypt? that one with gerard butler as the evil brother?well this is just like it...probably a star or two better though.this films fantastic.well paced..a little gory..but the visual effects and adolescent like love story line is wonderful...i think anybody n everybody will enjoy this film..kinda like a modern day goonies.
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Warning: Spoilers This movie is a disaster with its horribly random script, flat characters, terrible CGI, and an unbelievable romance.So let's talk SCRIPT. This should be easy, because there isn't one. The story follows the exploits of a young demon hunter as he hunts down three demons: water and pig demon, and the Monkey King. There is no set up to each encounter as the title character Xuan Zang tends to show up out of the blue, do battle, fail, and get saved by a better demon hunter Miss Duan. That's how each fight transpires from start to finish over the course of a 2 hour movie. We never really learn much about the title characters or a handful of minor characters who randomly appear and disappear. The whole movie and the threat of these demons is just glossed over for special effect and battle pieces that get rather boring by the end of the film.Xuan Zang is the lead—a demon hunter who believes in reforming demons rather than killing them, but we never learn why. There are no flashbacks or character development to lead us to understand why he thinks so differently about the monsters. He's a typical Chow innocent, almost exactly like Chow's character in a dozen of his previous movies. He is horrible at what he does until the end when he finally rises to the occasion.Second central character is Miss Duan (the love interest). She appears to help him out against the water demon and then appears out of nowhere when he tries to fight the pig demon. All we know about her is that she isn't an innocent as she kills whoever steps in her path and doesn't know how to flirt or express herself without using her fist. She travels the world with her sister and a couple hired goons that we only see once in a prolonged sequence in the middle of the movie. Like everyone else in this movie we never learn enough about them to care.I understand this is a comedy/action/fantasy movie, but enough character background and development has to be done for us to root for them and sadly, there wasn't. When people start to die at the end—you don't care.The CGI is laughably bad. I'll be honest, during the sequence with the water demon (by far the best part of the whole film) the effects looked great. The water demon looked fantastic, but the pig, the green screen sets, and the over-the-top ending are just so cartoon and obviously fake that it takes away from the film.One of the biggest problems for the film is the forced romance between the central characters. There is no chemistry between them. Miss Duan follows Xuan Zang to each of his encounter with the demons to ensure his safety and when the battle is over tries to get him to confess he loves her, which is something he never does until the ending. She gets rejected, if I remember correctly, 3 or 4 times before (SPOILER WARNING) he finally admits to loving her for 10,000 years as she dies! This romance had about as much heat and passion in it as Twilight. I couldn't believe how flat and forced it was with no payoff.But there are more crimes against this movie which just annoyed me to no end—blatant stealing of items from other Stephen Chow movies. Now part of me believes that Stephen Chow didn't direct this whole movie—in fact, you can see that there are two directors.The Water Demon sequence is about 15 to 20 minutes long and is on a beautifully constructed set—similar to the one found in Kung Fu Hustle. The humor here is excellent, the camera shots, the tension, the drama, everything works perfectly. I was thrilled to be watching one of my favorite Chinese directors hit his mark and exceed. However, after that sequence and a short encounter with Xuan Zang's teacher, Buddha in earthly form, the film falls apart and the ripping off begins. Here are some examples: 1.) The Nursery Rhyme Book: in this film, Xuan Zang uses a book of nursery rhymes in an attempt to bring out the goodness in the demons. Other demon hunters laugh at him and mock him from using it, which later turns out to be a very powerful weapon against the Monkey King. In Kung Fu Hustle it's the same thing—main character buys a book of Kung Fu from a guy, everyone thinks it's a joke, but later on he realizes how to use and becomes a great Kung Fu master.2.) The score from this movie comes from Kung Fu Hustle.3.) Prince Important uses magic swords to fight in the exact same way as the blind music killers from Kung Fu Hustle.4.) (SPOILERS) Buddha kills the Monkey King with the Palm Stephen Chow's character in Kung Fu Hustle used to defeat the villain.All these factors lead me to believe that Stephen Chow directed the first part and was basically helping with the film rather than directing. If I am wrong, then it's a sad day when you see such comedic genius fall so far from grace. If you want to see a hilarious Stephen Chow movie about the Journey to the West see his old movies instead.The last thing I will mention is the endingoh man, what a joke! (SPOILERS) In the end, the three demons join our main character as he travels to the west to spread the word of Buddha—but why would you want to see the continued adventures of a demon who ate a little girl, a demon that had a hotel used to lure travelers so he could eat them, or a Monkey King who ripped a guy's throat out and killed the main characters love?"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I've only had 4 or 5 1 ratings...This is one of them. Obviously Chinese humor is a bit different.. this was just ridiculous. Or maybe it was made for very little kids though with the violence I doubt it. Whew..,"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"With a subtitle ""conquering the demons"", JOURNEY TO THE WEST is Hong Kong megastar-turned-filmmaker Stephen Chow's re-imagination of the Chinese proverbial fantasy story, almost two decades after his iconic incarnation of Monkey King in Jeffrey Lau's by turns infectiously funny and archly romantic two-parts pan-Chinese comedy apotheosis A CHINESE ODYSSEY (1995). Here, strictly hewing to his onus behind the camera, Stephen Chow tactically visualizes an enlightenment-seeking adventure of the young Buddhist Tang Sanzang (Wen Zhang), an unorthodox demon hunter who inclines to chant nursery rhymes to elicit a demon's innate goodness, is under persistent courtship from a more practical-minded fellow hunter Miss Duan (Shu Qi), and the story basically pertains to how Sanzang tames his three unruly half-human-half-beast disciples, the Monkey King aka. Sun Wukong (Huang Bo), the Pig Demon aka. Zhu Bajie (Chen Bingqiang) and the Water Buffalo, aka. Sha Wujing (Li Shangzheng), a prequel of the quartet's journey westward to quest for Buddhist sutra.It is unexpectedly riveting to discover that the most distinctive characteristic in the screenplay is Chow's U-turn stratagem of depicting the three disciples, in their most primordial and feral predator mindset, a pre-teen girl is swallowed alive by the Water Buffalo, whereas in the Pig Demon's restaurant, corpses are embedded inside the roast pigs served to entice unsuspecting clientele, as for the Monkey King, whose bumptious temperament and indiscriminately blood-thirsty propensity is magnified to an appalling scope that ludicrously disproportionate to his diminutive and ferocious animal form (played by child actor Ge Xingyu under special makeups), all of which are poles away from audience's entrenched preconception. Conversely, Chow's trademark comedic bent is significantly pared down in service of his dramatic revelation (including an almost sadistically suicidal devotion which duly triggers the deus ex machina in the eleventh hour), a mid-section ploy arouses most laughter with Miss Duan's riff-raff, but this is fairly standard treatment for those who are au fait with Chow's track record (both as directors and top-notch comedian actors), not to mention a cringe-worthy reaction toward Prince Important's elongated important/impotent faux pas (played by Taiwan red-hot entertainer Show Lo). The tenor of the story is more or less the same from A CHINESE ODYSSEY, no happy ending is preordained, only this time, the protagonist is the master Sanzang, after a belated confession of love to Miss Duan, he finally gets the satori that love should not be divided by ""big"" and ""small"", but it is equally banal and frustrating when one can only that through a tragic loss, also there is an uneasy feeling to watch a woman repeatedly debases herself to solicit her unrequited feeling from a man, especially in this day and age. The cast is, for the most part, adept, although Wen Zhang is far cry from a hardened comedian, but Shu Qi compensates with her aptitude in making Miss Duan as fey as her own quavering singing voice and dance moves, however, the biggest boon is Huang Bo, who plays the Monkey King in human form, effortlessly shifting between obsequious and treacherous, and generates more spark with Shu Qi even in half-hearted improvisation, why it is not him in the center of the story is one's knee-jerking question to Stephen Chow's VFX-heavy crowd-pleaser arbitrarily cashes in on his audience's nostalgia for a bygone era."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Another Stephen Chow﻿ masterpiece like Kung Fu Hustle﻿ or Shaolin Soccer﻿ before it, and many more that have been inspiring Directors, and writers all over the world for a couple of decades now. Over the top, and full of fantasy, but set up in such a cartoonish way that you do not really feel that anything you are seeing could not be. Such amazing choreography, and wire stunts some of which will leave you breathing heavily. A talented cast who are just as funny as they are incredibly acrobatic, and willing to go as far as it takes to give the scene that sense of reality in a completely cartoonish fashion. I could not have help ed but Enjoy this movie, there is just so much good natured fun to be had. Babies rescued, old ladies turning out to be tougher nuts to crack that first appearances, and really fantastical beasts, and monsters on large sets that have great artistic license taken to allow for you even more outlandish surprises. Recommend? Well of course, but why not be proactive, and just watch it before all the folks at your work ruin all the fun for you by talking about it in front of your desk, you won't be sorry. This movie is great for the whole family with laughs a plenty, and action to keep even the most frigidity folks focused. In a pinch, before you pick your seat, pick this movie.Jesse of Jesse.ca"

The movie starts on a faster note with lots of action and fights but gets slow in between.The background music is good and location are mainly made from graphics. The movie could be one of the best movie for a certain viewers and could disappoint to another."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Loved this funny, quirky movie! Good writing and acting."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"""Journey to the West"" is a very funny movie, that can jump from action to horror to humour in ten seconds and still keep it all together and make sense. Stephen Chow's influence is seen throughout the whole of the movie, and only an overlong third act takes a little bit from a movie full of imagination and funny (and ridiculous) moments.Tang Sanzang wants to be a monk and stop demons from being bad and killing people. He does so with the teachings he learned from his master: an old guy that just steals food and doesn't seem really keen on stopping demons. At the same time Tang Sanzang tries to make demons change some demon hunters just want to stop and erase them from the face of the Earth.The movie is very loosely based on the novel with the same title, that has gotten lots of adaptations and is very popular. But even if you know the story, it won't matter much, because the movie is so infused with Chow's trademark of craziness and silliness that it will surprise the viewer constantly. The funny scenes come and go, constantly, some funnier than others that just fall flat, and the action is non-stop. But what really makes it really fun is the imagination that is infused in every frame of the movie. It is amazing how they can go from one joke to a lot of blood to another joke and don't fall in many of the problems movies that try so fall: becoming tonally uneven and jarring.On the down side, the special effects are a little bit lame sometimes. But that is forgivable. More of a problem is the overlong last part that should have been cut a little bit.In any case, totally worth watching."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"As an American who is not aware of the story with which this is based on, I had to evaluate it strictly as a movie. It is a bit of a mixed bag, but overall, I'm positive about the film, as the good stuff is really good.The not-so-good: The first 20 minutes with the opening set-up scene is not very funny and drags on. Also, for American sensibilities, it's a little shocking to see a five year old girl get killed and swallowed up by a giant fish in what is ostensibly supposed to be a comedy. I also thought the last 10-15 minutes or so, with the battle with the Monkey King was also not as exciting as I think it was supposed to be.The very good: About 20-25 minutes in, when the scene shifts to the restaurant/inn, the film becomes very funny, and wacky. It's definitely got the ""Stephen Chow"" signature look and humor. Wen Zhang does a very good job in what I would call the ""Stephen Chow"" role that he probably would have taken himself had he been younger. Seeing Chow in the behind-the-scenes with gray hair is indeed a bit shocking. Finally, Shu Qi, in an intentionally over-the-top comedic role as a rival demon hunter is sweet and surprisingly very funny. As she has gotten older, she has begun to transition well to other roles where she has to perform, and not rely solely on her stunning beauty when she was younger.Journey to the West isn't as good as Chow's Shaolin Soccer, but I thought it was better than his Kung Fu Hustle. That might be blasphemous, seeing how many Chinese awards Kung Fu Hustle received, but I just thought this one was funnier and easier to follow."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I seriously love the damn crap out of Kung Fu Hustle. So, after I saw that, I wanted more. Therefore I have watched a couple of the other Stephen Chow's movies. I saw that alien robot movie of his, and did not really like it. But then this turns up! Another kung-fu-movie!Whoop!Expectations were a little high, but I still came out liking it. The style is a little more ""Asian"" this time, (Kung Fu Hustle was a little more Western, as in western part of the world, not cowboys) but I think Asian humor can be quite fun, although pretty strange.(Don't hate me for saying Asian. I am aware that Asian is not just Asian, I say Asian for convenience sake)Anyway, this movie is one hell of a ride. I mean, this is fantasy, over-the-top, weird action. Towards the end there is a scene that is so grandiose, so ""big"" that it is almost touching, in a sense.A thing with some Asian movies is that they mix together genres in a very peculiar way. Suddenly some strange joke, or an element of horror just pops out of nowhere. Adds some randomness to the experience.So, the movie is entertaining, has some good fighting, some humor that works and a couple of quite strange elements."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I love Stephen Chow's with action films and Hong Kong cinema. And my favorite film from him is easily ""A Chinese Odyssey"", one of my favorite movies. So, when I heard he returned to it in 2013, I was a little mixed on what I'd think about it. Reviews were pretty mixed, and I was just a little skeptacle. However, when I washed it, I surprisingly fell in love with it...The first praises of mine are with the visuals. Although the CGI does not especially hold up, and looks a little off, but for the time they looked fine enough I guess. I think the film's cinematography looks incredible, allows the effects to blend in better. And along with that, a lot of the film is shot on real location, and when the backgrounds are CGI, they're surprisingly good. Stephen Chow is able to make the most out of the visuals, and craft a beautiful looking movie.The film is also not boring. There's something constantly happening, and it's always entertaining to watch. Weather it's witty dialogue or amazing action. Speaking of that, the dialogue is on point and hilarious, providing barrels of laughs. And in my opinion, funnier than ""A Chinese Odyssey"". The action is also on point, utalizing CGI, and improving it from ""A Chinese Odyssey"". Also utalizing great action choreography and hilarious slapstick.The characters in this film are also charming, likable and interesting. It centers around a demon hunter in ancient China who searches for the Monkey King, and comes across love and all that. The characters I found myself caring for. And while I don't like these people as much as the characters in ""A Chinese Odyssey"", but on their own, I think they're amazingly written.I still prefer ""A Chinese Odyssey"", but this film is just on part with that film. They are both excellent adaptations of the classic fable, and both some of the best films of all time."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The very unique film, Journey to the West, directed and filmed by Stephen Chow, was one of the weirdest and most quirky films I have ever seen. This film had a ton of cultural references that may have been difficult for some of us viewers to understand because the Chinese culture and traditions are so much different than ours here in the United States. This very much included the different forms of comedy presented in the film. Although wacky, I somehow liked the film for all the action and adrenaline it contained. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Chinese culture, or mythological beings and magic."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I am giving this a score of, well, what I gave it because it is a great movie. My standards are quite high...and a movie hits me if I am able to watch it all without volume. As David Mamet once said, a good director should strive to make a silent movie, and Chow, again, has done that. If you can watch a movie sans sound then it is a great movie...I place this film alongside QT's 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Eyes Wide Shut'.Up until now I liked Russell Wong's interpretation of the Monkey King. But (and what a BUTT it is), Huang Bo trumps even Hans Landa as a villain. Chow isn't afraid to expose THIS simian to many circumstances in a space of ten minutes: he flirts, he sniffs, he lies, he bleeds, he complains about youths of nowadays, he laughs, he is impressed by one of his opponents...and then he even mocks the protagonist during his mourning in a performance which is my favourite throughout the film..."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Chow can do no wrong. His style and sense of humour are amazing and very rewarding. Anyone knocking this gem of a film honestly has nothing in their soul. It's well acted, funny, unpredictable and a delight. The only negative is that it's not in English so the subtitles can't do some if the comedy justice. You can tell sometimes what they were trying to do and in Chinese I'm sure it's hillarious but we westerners can only play subtitle catchup. I love all of Stephens films. This isn't as good as Kung fu hustle or shaolin soccer even but those are 9s and 10s. I thouroughly enjoyed the time spent with this movie and can't wait to watch the sequel."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West is the most popular folklore in eastern Asia and had been told in various forms and through out ages and generations. Thus, I have little expectation to start this journey of fantasy. However, I can say I am totally taken by the movie, least to consider it is directed by Stephen Chow, an Asian box office Jim Carrey whose movie rarely means something other laughters. And I cannot believe it's box office in US is less than USD20K while later I found the total box office is more than USD200mio.The Good The casts are great. The plot is fast and almost no meaningless scenes. And the best part is this movie really shows the beasts, or monsters, as why they are monsters. For you who are not familiar with the tale, the past of the monsters were always toned down, maybe it is because the tale is told to kids as bedtime stories.The Bad There is a missing part known to all, in which the Monkey King feels sorry for his bad behavior which is the reason he submitted himself to the Monk and forgiven by Budha.Summary I find this as the best depiction of the well known myth in eastern Asia that can be enjoyed by those that has not known the story."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I'm a fan of Stephen Chow's work, I've always liked his vision for cinema, and also his taste in comedy, like Shaolin Soccer & Kung Fu Hustle. To me, his Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons was a very unique take on the Chinese folktale that worked great for me and I loved it. A thoroughly entertaining fantasy, action, comedy movie. All the actors gave a solid performance, the set pieces were also astounding, and the story was clever. I honestly would've liked if Stephen Chow could've had a role in this as he did for A Chinese Odyssey Part 1: Pandora's Box & A Chinese Odyssey Part 2: Cinderella, where he plays the Monkey King."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Man, Stephen Chow hasn't made a film in a long time. His last film was CJ7(2008), a decent but overly schmultzy family film that more or less polarized fans and critics. But after six years in the waiting, Chow finally returns to big screen with Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. Another retelling of the classic Wu Cheng'en fantasy story except this time, Chow will only be directing, not starring. A first for him. So since this is a Stephen Chow film, there'll be a lot of hype to live up to. Does he succeed? Let's find out!The story follows Tang Sanzang before he became the Longevity Monk when he was just a demon hunter who holds a special philosophy taught by his master that demons should be spared and taught to be good and not killed. He starts questioning his philosophy and skills as a demon hunter after partaking in a grisly attack on a village by a fish demon where he failed to tame it and a few citizens, including a five-year-old girl, died along the way. Instead, the demon gets taken care of by another demon hunter by the name of Miss Duan, who carries no qualms about killing. After feeling guilty for the deaths in the village and questioning himself whether or not is he right to be a demon hunter, his master sends him out to deal with a pig demon where the job ends up being Miss Duan's once again. The pig demon escapes, however, so he goes on a journey to seek the help of the legendary Monkey King, to take care of the pig demon.I'm gonna start with the biggest problem with this film, the love story. This movie tries in many ways to re-create the tragic love story of Sun Wukong and Zixia from A Chinese Odyssey(1995) but the thing that makes this love story fall flat for me is that there seems to be no deeper attraction to these two other than what's purely on the surface. I can buy Sanzang being interested in her because she's a kick a$$ demon hunter but I don't buy him being in love with her throughout the entire film because later on, she does some really immoral acts on him just to get laid. There's a scene where she gets her group of demon hunter friends to pose as a gang of thieves forcing him to have sex with her! She also rips his ""300 Nursery Rhymes"" book, hits him, and magically forces a ring onto his finger, therefore claiming him to be her husband. She just comes across a big b!tch throughout and I don't understand how anyone could like her beyond her looks.But while the love story doesn't work, the entertainment factor in this film is still terrific. This film features a lot of creative action set pieces with a lot of really neat superpowers that we've never really seen before. I was especially impressed with the fight between Tang Sanzang and the Monkey King towards the end of the film. Not only is it extremely creative and fun to watch, I also like the symbolism of the giant Buddha palm representing how the Monkey King can't escape the grasp of Buddha's hand controlling his fate. It's a clever touch and a nice reference to the Buddhist Palm in Kung Fu Hustle(2004).But the CGI in this film just looked awful. There's many characters that are completely animated by it and they just looked like video game characters. The skin texture just looked really fake and digital and their bodies never seem to react at all in the light condition they are in. I know this is an Asian production so I can't expect the same level of production value as a Hollywood flick but to be honest, I think both Kung Fu Hustle(2004) and CJ7(2008) looked better! Aren't special effects supposed to get better over the course of time?While I didn't like Duan, most of the characters and actors portraying them worked for me. While Wen Zhang is obviously trying to mimic the young Stephen Chow, he did do a good job at it so I can't fault him. Although, Chow himself probably would've done better with the comedy. While I don't like the character, Shu Qi played Duan just fine. The three demon hunters(forgot their names other than Prince Important and couldn't find the name of the actors anywhere) were fun to watch but I really didn't feel any sort of contribution to the plot from them whatsoever. If their scenes were cut, the plot would've unraveled exactly the same. Huang Bo is funny as the human form of the Monkey King but when he transforms back into his original form, he played it too much like a typical bad guy to the point where I can't see him developing into a hero if they ever make a sequel(which will probably happen).The comedy wasn't hilarious, but it did keep me laughing enough to keep watching and I especially liked the joke about Prince Important mispronouncing his name to be Prince Impotent. The fat lady joke with was pretty awful, though. With his recent films, I've noticed that Stephen Chow's legendary status as HK's ""King of Comedy"" is owed more to the directors and writers he worked with such as Jeffrey Lau and Wong Jing rather than his own screen writing skills. He's not a terrible comedy director, but he needs someone like Lee-Lik Chi or Vincent Kok to craft the jokes for him as his recent films haven't been nearly as funny as his 90's work.Overall, if you can accept the crappy CGI and unconvincing love story, you'd be pleased with the action, fun characters, and humor JUST enough to get over those flaws. I'm gonna give it a 6/10."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"This is a Buddhist story. Let's get that out of the way. It illustrates the path to spiritual enlightenment.The thing that struck me about Stephen Chow's iteration of the classical illustration was its universality. This story is only confusing to people who've never read any spiritual thing and asked, ""What's the point of this?""The Demon Hunters are a metaphorical community of humanists, basically. People who regard themselves to be in control of their destinies - leveraging technologies and magic in their fight for mastery over the evil that lives in all of us. The meek kid with the book of 300 Nursery Rhymes states early in the film, ""I don't want to kill (demons), I want to bring out their goodness."" This is the person leveraging love which, by the end of the film, we figure out is the power of God (Buddha).It's a beautiful story, beautifully illustrated and enriched by the performances of some seriously talented actors and actresses. I've seen many of these actors in other Stephen Chow productions but everyone really appeared to have brought their A-Game. All the performances were inspired. My favorites being the main character, his sifu and the actor who portrayed the Monkey King (WuKong).I rate NOTHING 10/10 - that's perfection and nothing is that. So I give this movie 9/10 for what it was, what it set out to do and how well it did it as well as the experience it afforded me."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Oh dear! And sometimes (in best George Takei spirit) OH MY! ;) You will understand when you see it, dont wanna spoil it for you :)Overall, good action, lots of cgi, lots of wire jumping, good entertainment with a few of the funniest scenes i seen in quite a while.I personally have never thought Stephen Chow ever have been funny, not even once. And if ive know he was behind this, i probally would not have watched this. That would have been a mistake. So if you share my (former) opinion on Chow, i say still give this movie a go!Also Qi Shu delivers quite the kickass heroine, not the ""silly-scream-and-faint-heroine"" that is so very common, she more of a ""punch 'em in the face"" kinda girl :D"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"You need to see this movie! I just caught this on one of our public TV channels, and absolutely LOVED it! From the same Chinese legend that the TV series Monkey was based on, this movie tells the lead in story as to how the disparate group lead by Tripitaka came to be.Gorgeous pictures, great CGI and effects, and laugh out loud comedy. The performances are great...the lead character is adorable (I know, that sounds inane, but it's the only way to describe him) and the demon hunter who !s forever saving him is such a great, strong, female character. Their relationship is a bit of a role reversal of the usual Western cinema tradition. And the Monkey King.....just a delight.For fans of the TV show, this is the ultimate back story, though it doesn't matter if you've never seen it. Journey To the West is a great stand alone film, but if you are a 50 something Monkey tragic (as I clearly am) it's a really special treat!"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The movie Journey to the West by Stephen Chow is an adaption of classic Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en. It is an adapted pre-story of the actual book. I read the actual classic before and watched the famous series of Journey to the West. I will give this film a 8 out of 10 because I like most of the plots in this movie. Stephen Chow's movies always have his style of humor, and I really enjoy watching his movies. However, what makes me really confused is how he narrate the main characters as demons. In my opinion, the story in this movie has barely connection with Journey to the West and the idea is different from the book. For example, the main female character, Miss Duan has never been mentioned in the book. Her love story with Tang Sanzang does not make any sense because the figure of Tang Sanzang should be extremely devout. If I look at this film separately from Journey to the West, I will like it better than now."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. Right from the start there was a lot of different things going on that I could not quite get a handle on. I am not used to watching anything like this type of movie. Obviously I do not know much at all about what the story is about and the importance of the story in China, but I would recommend it to a friend. Especially since there is a sequel that just recently came out in China, I may take a look at it when it is released in the United States. Back to the story though, it all starts with a little girl and her father, as he is then taken away by a man eating fish. Then various demon hunters come and that is when the story begins. They go through many different demons together, a fish, a hog, and a monkey. Eventually all of the demon hunters meet up and fight the monkey, and they all lose except for the main character. All of the others have made fun of his method of fighting the demons, and that method was somewhat through his beliefs. The movie is heavily influenced by Buddhism, as that is what eventually defeats the monkey. The main character then lives on as a Buddhist monk and travels with the three demons that he previously defeated, in a search for even more demons to take down. Then we get to the sequel, you will have to watch it to find out what happens next. Overall, a very interesting movie."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West adapted extremely loosely from a very famous 16th-century Chinese novel is one of those movies that dares to mix unspeakable horror with laugh-out-loud slapstick, high- minded themes with dumb humor. Stephen Chow, who also made a name for himself Stateside with the hits Shaolin Soccer and Kung-fu Hustle, specializes in this kind of gonzo action comedy, and this is the most ambitious and the spectacular movie he's made yet."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West directed by Stephen Chow was a very interesting movie. In some ways it was similar to some goofy American comedies that I have seen. I liked how it used a serious idea like Buddhism to underlie the story and then brought in various ridiculous, goofy scenes to add some comedic relief. I found that I laughed out loud a couple times which I honestly did not expect would happen so I was pleasantly surprised. I loved that there was a powerful female warrior character, Duan, who got stuff done. It was interesting how Chen, the main male character, was portrayed as weak and almost childish. In the end, however, Chen showed his strength when he handled extreme pain caused by the Monkey King, the king of all demons, and called the Buddha to come defeat him. That was my favorite part because although Duan was killed by the Monkey King, Chen finally admitted that he had loved Duan all along. It was devastatingly sad because they could never be together since she was dying, but I was happy that he admitted to loving her. Overall, I would give this film four out of five stars."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I liked the Buddhism aspects of this movie, it made it enjoyable to watch from a cultural aspect. The plot of the movie was pretty bland, generally ranging from fighting the next demon. The CGI demons in the movie were made fairly badly, but I did enjoy how they came from the bad behavior of those humans. The main character of the movie was the most interesting luckily, so that made this movie enjoyable to watch. He was trying to cleanse the demons rather than kill and capture them. I liked how he used a more peaceful, Buddhist like path to cleanse them through the 300 Nursery Rhymes. The love interest in this movie was fairly boring in my opinion and felt very forced and unnecessary. This movie at times was trying too hard to be funny, which made it just seem ridiculous and not needed. (ie: the fat lady jumping on the board) Overall I found this movie to be fairly enjoyable from a cultural perspective, but I did not enjoy it from a comedy perspective."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"This to me was a very fun movie to watch. It follows the story of disciple who hunts demons with children's nursery rhymes. His technique is to sing the evil out of them. He meets a girl named Duan, who also hunts demons, but has a much more violent approach. Throughout the movie, she quickly falls in love with Sanzang, the singing hunter. He consistently denies his love for her throughout the film, but finally admits it once the Monkey King, who he accidentally releases, kills her. As the movie goes on, Duan and Sanzang fight demons together. When the Pig Demon becomes too powerful, Sanzang asks his master for help. His master tells him he needs to find the Monkey King. The Monkey King finally decides to aid Sanzang and Duan, but then tricks Sanzang into pulling out the lotus flower, which is sealing the entrance to his cave. He escapes and begins to wreak havoc. After killing Duan, and several other demon hunters, Sanzang calls upon the power of Buddha and smites the Monkey King into solitude. My favorite part about this film was the slight comedic twist it had to it. It also had pretty good effects and the story was always entertaining. I was never bored at all throughout the film at all. I also really enjoyed hearing each demon's backstory. I thought they were all very clever."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey To The West is now one of my favorite movies that I have watched, foreign or otherwise. I thought it was a hilarious movie to watch and sometimes I even forgot that it was in a different language. I also found myself picking up a lot of the subtle jokes, such as a nose bleeding part, when the rest of the people watching it with me didn't seem to understand. It was a lot of dry humor and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought the animation was beautiful, both the execution and the artistic style that they chose for it. The directing of the movie was very good, and I liked the tie ins to mythology. It's rare to find movies that deal with mythology in a new light that is successful, and I think Journey To The West did an excellent job explaining it. I really don't have any complaints for the movie, and I can't wait for an English translation to be released for the sequel."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West is a Chinese film that focuses on the Buddhist traditions and beliefs. This was a very interesting and entertaining film. I liked the way that it used the concept of Buddhism in the movie, and made things science fiction, resembling to American films. In the beginning of the film there is a village and they are being attacked by a demon creature.The main character Chen presents himself as a demon hunter, and tells the village that he will protect everyone from the demon, but yet fails to do so. In replacement to his position is a woman named Duan who presents herself as a demon hunter as well, and yet she succeeds at turning the fish creature into a toy. After this scene Duan always finds Chen and comes to his rescue in the troubling times, when he does not know how to protect himself. Duan showed her love for Chen in the film, but Chen never did and this was the main conflict. My favorite character was Chen, because at the end of the film even though he failed at protecting Duan from the monkey king, he admitted to have loved her all along. After this overview, I would rate this film a 4/5."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"When I heard Stephen Chow had a new film out, I rushed to see it. After all, the movies he writes and directs are in general his best. I figured even with him being only behind the lens instead of in front that it should be on par with God of Cookery, Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, Love on Delivery. Alas it seems that we have a rehashing here of everything that worked elsewhere, but doesn't so much here.There are very few funny moments here that you haven't seen in another film of his. In particular it borrows heavily from Kung Fu Hustle, but without the style that made it unique. It's silly for sure. Where is the brilliant word play though that Chow is so well known for? We have lots of poorly designed CGI, which in the end may be its greatest fault. We also have a love element, but gone are the punctuated moments of tragedy that hit despite being in a comedy (like the breaking of the sucker in Kung Fu Hustle or the taste of the buns in Shaolin Soccer).I didn't dislike it, but it wasn't what I hoped it would be. I didn't feel connected to the characters, I didn't laugh much, I wasn't blown away by the action.Stephen Chow love aside, this is bad CGI fantasy with no real sense of pacing, but if you take his name out and just look at it like a cheap rental or watch then it may be worth it."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"This film was very interesting and funny. The main character Xuan Zang is a demon hunter. He is different from the other demon hunters because he uses a different approach. Instead of using violence he uses a book of nursery rhymes to bring out the innocence in the demons. He meets a lady named Miss Daun who helps him hunt demons. She is always coming in to save him from the demons. Instantly she falls in love with him. Throughout the movie we see her trying to prove to him that she loves him back. Only when he realizes it, it is too late. This helps him come to his ultimate Buddha and find what he has been missing all along. Xuan Chang shows courage throughout the movie because he doesn't give up and believes in the good of the demons. He even manages to defeat the legendary Monkey King. This shows us that anything can be accomplished even when you least expect it."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Almost never do I review a movie or award 10 stars. This Movie will surprise you. You may think this is just a delightful child's Kung-Fu fantasy comedy, but follow through to the end for a truly beautiful, profound and moving journey. Not only does this movie cover many of the concepts of Kung Fu and the elements of fantasy, it has fantastic effects, beautiful settings filled with wonderment, a lovely musical score and is a mind blowing tribute to all the highest ideals of Buddhism. Don't let go of a single minute. Enjoy every aspect of this witty film until the end. You will be surprised by the final minutes of this film's moving ending. To all those who know Buddhism you will see many allusions and tributes to the precepts and attributes of the belief system. To all those to whom Buddhism remains a mystery this will surely delight."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Honestly i find it enjoyable but not that much, this feels alot like ""before journey to the west"" but it just doesnt fit the original sun wukong journey."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Being very fond of the Monkey King myths and Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer, I wanted to like this film.The only things I liked about this film was seeing the lovely Shu Qi again and the nearly as lovely CGI vistas and effects. There were at times a very miserly sprinkling of Stephen Chow humor, but far too little. And, that's about it.A short time after watching her father get bloodily torn to bits and eaten, a young girl gets eaten by the same fish. Is she somehow going to be cut out of the fish and rescued? Nope, a young child really is dead...on screen. As a viewer, I don't know what to think for the rest of the film and am not really in the mood to laugh any more.Shu Qi's talents were poorly utilized as the writing didn't seem to accommodate believable character growth. In fact her character was not believable at all. The transition from loathing Zhang Wen's ""unshaven monk"" character to wanting to have his babies in the next scene left me befuddled. Her character spends the rest of the film going to ridiculous and irrational lengths to pursue him romantically until her untimely yet predictable death. This followed by a second helping of cliché as the monk holds her dying body and finally proclaims his love for her and kisses her dying lips. I'd rather watch Twilight at this point. Again, aside from the feeble pedantic writing, I'm not sure how this supposed to contribute to what was billed as a comedic adaptation of a whimsical fable. The Monkey King himself was the biggest disappointment. Instead of the good, but mischievous prankster turned wiser character from one of China's most beloved fairy tales, he is instead a raggedy, embittered creepster. If this tremendous departure from the original character does not bother you, I still can't see how this reinvented Monkey was supposed to get any endearment from the audience.The climax is learning that this was all a less than cleverly veiled Buddhist sermon about the nature of suffering and evil in the world. Let me make this clear that this is not the crime of the movie- the crime is that it could have been done much more beautifully and eloquently. Failing that, it could have been done less clumsily.It ends with the protagonist, now dubbed ""Triptaka"" heads into the West with the three demons now in human form (the original tale had them retain their animal qualities). I might have more appreciated the Western riding-off-into-the-sunset motif had I not been thoroughly disgusted by this point. Hey wait, according to the title, isn't this where the film should start?Is this a comedy? Not really.Is it a horror film? Half because there are some truly grotesque blood and gore, and half because of the truly grotesque writing.Is this a tale about Buddhism? Yes, but clumsily executed and failing entirely to capture the true beauty of Buddhist thought and spirituality.Is this a faithful adaptation of a popular folk tale. DEFINITELY NOT!And now, Stephen Chow is no longer a name I'm excited about."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I read that this was Stephen Chow's first movie in 4 years ... that explains a lot since he's nowhere in form (as yet?) or could it be time has passed him by? Or perhaps my expectation was a tad bit too high?This movie falls in trying to do many things but failing or falling short in each.Was it trying to be a drama? Could work if there were better acting. A comedy? There were some funny moments ... it may be the only passing grade this movie has, but it could have been better. And the morbid opening sequence somehow stole a bit from the movie. A martial art movie? Again, fell below passing grade.Watch the movie, but don't have any expectation and you'll be fine."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"This film is jam packed with tons of Stephen Chow's comedic style. It has action, love, and some scenes on the meaning of life. There also some descriptions on ancient Chinese symbols. It begins with this supposed demon hunter trying to warn a village that the creature they just killed was not the demon they thought(a giant stingray). Instead, the real demon was a large man eating fish. They eventually get the fish out of the water and the demon hunter(Xuan Zang) attempts to rid the demon of evil and only leave good behind through his book of nursery rhymes. They were to no avail and he started to get beaten up by the fish until a real women demon hunter came about and fought the demon, killing it. The novice demon catcher began to question his abilities as a demon hunter and decided to go to get some food from an infamous restaurant. It turned out the restaurant was run by a demon who tricked the newcomers into being killed and fed to the next who are foolish enough to enter. However, the novice demon fighter suspects something wrong with everything and calls out the demon, but as he calls him out the women demon hunter from the previous fight appears and starts to fight the demon with her magic rings. They walk back to town and she tries to kiss him but he has vowed to only kiss a woman of great love. She keeps on following him trying to get him to like her in return and marry her, but he does not give in. The demon that the women demon hunter had fought before did not actually die and has been on the loose. The novice demon hunter decides to seek help from the monkey king who has been enslaved by buddha for the past 500 years. The monkey king tricks him into freeing him and begins to reign terror killing demon hunters and the women demon hunter who until her death the novice demon hunter does not show feelings of love for. He eventually reaches enlightenment and kills the monkey king with his powers"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I do not know if I liked Journey to the West or not. It was certainly different from other movies that I have seen. It was also overly dramatized, but I guess that is what makes the movie funny. Something that I do like about this movie is the reverse gender role. Usually, in movies, there is a guy trying to save a helpless girl; however, Duan, the female lead, is stronger and more capable Sanzang, the leading male. She is also the leader of her demon slaying party and saves Sanzang many times. On the other hand I did not like romance part of the Journey to the West. It seems forced and unnecessary. In the movie, they do not build to being in love, it just happens out of the blue."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Hong Kong's Stephen Chow became known to American audiences back in 2004-2005 with his deliriously madcap one-two punch of ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" the latter of which grossed over $17 million, no small feat for a subtitled film in today's landscape. His follow up in 2008, ""CJ7,"" didn't leave much of a mark, and in the ""what have you done for me lately"" business of film, this did not bode well for promotional efforts of later films.That is unfortunate, because his latest offering, ""Journey to the West,"" (in some areas secondarily titled ""Conquering the Demons"") is a delicious treat for the eyes and a ton of fun to watch unfold. Sadly, its total domestic gross was less than my year's salary (and I really don't make that much money), despite setting numerous box office records in China. Even at the Film Festival where I embarked on this ""Journey,"" it was buried in a weeknight midnight screening, and the attendance was sparse at best. Now it has arrived on DVD with little to no fanfare, and therefore little chance of it reaching an audience even on the level of ""Soccer"" and ""Hustle,"" and that makes me a little sad.The film stars Zhang Wen (""The Emperor and the White Snake"") as Xuan Zang, a professional demon hunter who attempts to bring out the innocence of the frightening demons he encounters by reading to them from a children's fairy tale book. Judging by the fact that he is alive, this seems to be a fairly successful method for him.On the other side of the demon hunting coin is Miss Duan (Qi Shu, ""The Transporter""), who prefers to slay her demons the old fashioned way – as violently as possible. Zang and Duan become reluctant partners as they travel the country looking for dangerous demons, including a gigantic Water Demon and a horrifying Pig Demon that will give them both more trouble than they perhaps bargained for.Along the way Duan falls for Zang, who is unable to reciprocate her amorous advances because he is seeking nirvana. This leads to complications in their business relationship, and the ultimate goal of taming the Monkey King, who has been trapped in a remote cave for over 500 years.The ""Journey"" that Chow takes the audience on is filled with amazing sights and tremendous action sequences, with lead characters that are easy to care about and get behind. It's the kind of fantasy film that lends itself to multiple viewings, and I intend to do just that.For more reviews, visit http://jakeziegler.wordpress.com/"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Journey to the West is about an odd Buddhist monk named Xuan Zang. Xuan Zang is a young demon hunter who must vanquish all of the demons he can find. In the beginning of this film, he is helping a bunch of frightened villagers to take down a giant, hungry, fish that is leaping from the water starting chaos. Xuan Zang has a preferred method of attacking and capturing the demons. He has this book called ""300 Nursery Rhymes."" Xuan Zang uses this book as a guide to capture and kill all demons. A rival demon hunter named Miss Duan keeps running into Xuan Zang. Miss Duan is a hardcore demon hunter, who is a fearless female that is not afraid of death. Miss Duan fights demons using her magical golden bracelet which is called ""The Infinite Flying Rings"". She uses these rings to duplicate them and then fling the circles through the air. Xuan Zang and Miss Duan go on many adventures together trying to capture demons. These two characters come across and face many different types of demons. With a sudden change of events Miss Duan finds herself falling hard for Xuan Zang. This film was extremely entertaining to watch. I like how there was so much action involved, and how the plot was constantly changing. One major theme tied into this film was the Buddha."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"Tang Sanzang, is a careful and loving buddhist monk who is also a demon hunter. Instead of using violence to defeat and capture the demons he uses nursery rhymes to try and defeat them. Furthermore, during his journey he must fight 3 demons in order to protect the village from the demon beings. However, there are other demon hunters that are not like him and do not see the good in the demons or try to save them, instead they capture the demons for ransom or fame. During Tang Sanzang travels he meets Miss Duan who falls in love with him and save s him repeatedly throughout the movie. Tang Sanzang must face the trial of love, good, and bad, and ultimately his own perseverance. Tang Sanzang, unlike all of the other demon hunters, does not use violence to defeat any of the monsters and is a true honest hero. I do wonder why the journey to kill and destroy demons had to be in the westerly direction and not in the east, north, or south. Like does the west have a negative connotation in both the U.S and China? I know that there is the wicked witch of the west in the wizard of Oz and Dorothy and the others must defeat her. Furthermore, I do not think that there is a difference in the United States and China for the use of the west as a negative connotation in their movies context. The film Journey to the west is very high quality and used CGI effects for production so their effects and screenplay is very evidently similar to the U.S.. I believe this happens because the U.S. and China are very developed countries and have the money to make movies look really good, not saying the other countries without the supplements of money could not make movies with high quality but it is definitely much appreciated."

大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I began watching this movie knowing that it was based off the novel by the same name, however, at the time I had not read the book so I was watching without any preconceived expectations. I for one, enjoyed this movie for what it was and I'm actually kinda surprised at the how far if was willing to go to show the savagery of the demons.There are really only two things that I didn't particularly care for, the first being the love interest. It felt to me as though the only reason why this sub plot was introduced was to set up jokes for later in the film. Having said that, the jokes are actually kind of funny at parts, they just feel out of place. My second complaint is with the c.g. To me it looks a little goofy and clean, given the setting. It already started to feel dated by the time I got around to watching this movie. Those are just minor flaws and it was an over all enjoyable movie.At the time of writing this review, I am good portion through the novel. Really the only similarities that this movie shares with the book are the names of the characters. This doesn't bug me as much as I would think that it would, in fact, it has made reading the book more enjoyable. If you have the time and you are interested, you wont be disappointed. As well, if you enjoyed the movie, I also recommend reading the book."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"The Chinese film, Journey to the West is based off the book Journey to the West. This film is said to be a kind of intro to the book. It is an action packed love story, with several twists and turns. The main character, Xuanzang, is a young Buddhist monk who is a sought out hero. At the beginning of the movie, he tries to save the people of a small wooden town from a demon. He faces rejection, but never stopped fighting for the people who turned their backs to him. He returns to his master and tells him that maybe he is not the chosen one, but his master says that he is. Xuanzang's master tells him to use a book of nursery rhymes to fight his battles. Xuanzang's goal is to become the greatest demon hunter there is. On his journey, he faces many battles with other demons and demon hunters who are all fighting for the same goal. At the end of the film, Xuanzang faces the hardest battle of his life. He experiences pain, loss, and heartbreak. These three casualties, motivate him to beat his greatest enemy and reach enlightenment."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I have to say that the positive reviews here are baffling to me. Perhaps Chow has succeeded in attracting audience from the West, but he's certainly losing long time Chinese fans like me.A Chinese Odyssey, a two-part movie back in 1994/1995 was arguably Chow's best work as an actor. Knowing that this is a prequel to that series I came in with great expectations. Yet after finishing the movie it left me pretty disappointed, to say the least.Script: The love between the two main characters are forced and unreal. I also don't see a strong theme throughout the movie - the Chinese Odyssey explores the tension between love and responsibility, and portrays that brilliantly (in both a funny and touchy way) throughout the series. This one? I am not so sure.I understand that Chow as a director does not intend to make humorous movies - this is clear when he was making the transition to being a director, e.g. King of Comedy. Yet back in those old movies he was still able to come up catchy/really funny lines which created a strong contrast of the underlying, sad theme. This one - it really is not funny.CGI/Acting: To me the CGI is pretty neat, and the acting is done quite nicely. Kudos to Bo Huang for an excellent portrayal of the Monkey King. But again, personally the script/storyline is far more important than the CGI."
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,"I rated the movie 6 only because of the beauty of one of the main characters played by Qi Shu - glamorous Taiwanese model and actress. Besides - the move gave me nothing new and original. When watching it I had the strong feeling that the inspiration for Stephen Chow was one of his previous movies - Kung Fu Hustle (which I find far more interesting and entertaining). The sf are OK but not astonishing, the plot and ""innovations"" are rather doubtful (the idea of big foot - what is this?), the actors are also OK but nothing special and above standard. To sum up - this is the movie you can watch if you have nothing better to do (unless you're a big fan of adventure-kung-fu movies)"
大话西游,Journey to the West (2013),,2013,2013.2.10,It is very interesting that the legend of the ten rings appears on this movie. It was a funny movie to watch and interesting. I like it. The beginning is a little strange but it gets funny once the actor Shu Qui shows up!

特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.You really have to wonder how a film like ""Special ID"" (2013) gets an average IMDb rating of 5.3 out of 10 while something like ""The Hobbit"" (2012) gets an 8.0. People have truly lost their sense of priorities while watching action films. Read some reviews of ""Special ID"" and you'll see all kinds of petty criticisms, from language dialects to overly decorated restaurants! Here's a newsflash for you. For an action film to satisfy, it needs a minimum of two things: good action and brisk pacing. Guess what. ""Special ID"" easily meets this standard and in fact surpasses it with some truly memorable action sequences. Sure, the script is boilerplate and basic (even a bit clumsy in spots), but that doesn't automatically tank the enjoyability of a film that focuses first and foremost on the action anyways.A cop (Donnie Yen) and his team of comrades go undercover in one of China's most ruthless underworld organizations to stop a gang leader. Andy On plays a good villain, while Tian Jing is a likable female lead. The action in this film is spaced out nicely, which assists the pacing quite well. The fight choreography is less ""showy"", opting to reflect a realistic, scrappy form of fist-fighting with some mixed martial arts peppered in. The finale lasts a whopping 15 minutes and showcases a suspenseful car chase. This actioner definitely satisfies.The director here is Clarence Fok, who has a hit or miss filmography but has given us some fun movies in the past – ""The Iceman Cometh"" (1989) and ""Black Panther Warriors"" (1994) being two fairly brainless crowd-pleasers that stand out. He has also contributed some truly riveting dramas. For example, his crime drama ""Century of the Dragon"" (1999) is one of the best triad films of the past 15 years. Overall, the direction in ""Special ID"" is solid during the action, with some very cool sweeping shots during the lengthy car chase.Unfortunately, Clarence should have vetoed some of the scoring choices in ""Special ID"" because the background music got intrusive at times. The sound design of this film feels amateurish and cheap early on, but get better as it progresses. This shouldn't be too much of a problem for fans of old school Hong Kong action flicks from the 80s and 90s, which many times had consistently poor production values but nevertheless succeeded at providing pure entertainment value. At the very least, ""Special ID"" looks nice while it gives the viewers its fist-to-face goodies."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"I am not really a big martial arts movie fan, but I enjoy watching a good one when I get the chance. ""Special ID"" is the only other Donnie Yen film I have seen after the phenomenal ""Ip Man"" and its lesser sequel. I was curious to watch Donnie fight in the modern setting. This film definitely confirms his excellence in martial arts choreography and execution -- from the quiet discipline of wuxia before to rough and rugged mixed martial arts this time.The story is common and predictable, Chan Chi-lung (Donnie Yen) is an undercover Hongkong cop who gets sent to China to help corner an up-and- coming crime boss, Sunny (Andy On), with whom he was close to in his previous assignment. There were no really big surprises or twists. But of course, we do not typically watch these types of films expecting a profound story, but it is mostly for the exhilarating action scenes. And in this aspect, I thought ""Special ID"" delivers big time.It was cool to see a different Donnie Yen as a brash and reckless cop, which was totally in contrast with his subdued character in ""Ip Man."" His range of fighting skills were all very elegant to watch in those incredibly and impossibly choreographed fight and car chase scenes. Be they in enclosed spaces or in wide-open areas, Donnie Yen is exhilarating to watch.Andy On plays a very convincing new debonair crime lord from the US. He figures in a very long climactic scenes of car chase with fighting, followed by an intense scene of bloody hand-to-hand combat. He was able to match the grace and flow of Yen's movements yet their scenes come across as gritty and realistic.As Yen's Chinese female police partner Fang Jing, pretty actress Tian Jing was made to mouth some pretty cheesy lines. But when it comes to her action scenes, her awkwardness disappears. She was unexpectedly awesome in her parkour scenes jumping and running across rooftops, and of course, her major fight scene set unbelievably inside the confines of a Land Rover! Reviews from many die-hard martial arts film fanatics have been harsh, calling this film a miss in Donnie Yen's filmography because of its sloppiness. However, for the casual viewer who only watches martial arts films occasionally, I do not see anything wrong with the action sequences I saw here in ""Special ID"". While they may miss the mark for bonafide MMA connoisseurs, for an ordinary guy like me, those action scenes and stunts were quite exciting and very entertaining. 6/10."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"I'm always surprise that Donnie Yeh has not exploded onto America like Jackie Chan or Jet Li. I saw a biography on the man and learned that he spent a lot of his childhood in the states and as such speaks better English than the average Chinese action star who basically just learned how to read lines in English. Kind of Ironic, and added to the fact that The Don is more attractive than his peers you would think Hollywood would be knocking on his door, Or maybe they are and Donnie chooses to stay away from the headaches the ones that came before him had to go through.Special ID shows the kind of hands-on film making Donnie gets to do in his native land. The action sequences are long and energetic like I would expect from a Kung Fu flick, and never let down. What I love best is the martial arts sequences are very contemporary with what's going on today. The Don does the traditional high speed flying kicks that are trade mark in Kung Fu, but I noticed that Donnie is using the rapid punches that remind me of his role as Ip Man. I also notice that mixed martial arts seems to have influenced the fights in this movie with a lot of low to the floor fighting which actually made the conflicts realer for me. Outside the fight choreography, there was also an awesome chase scene as well.Donnie plays a police officer who wants to take down China's most ruthless crime syndicate. In order to do this he has to go deep undercover, but when the mob boss suspects a traitor in his ranks, Don as ""Dragon"" Chan, is in trouble of getting his cover blown and his life ended, which puts him in conflict with his duty as a police official. His best ally is Fang Jing, an officer who puts herself on the line and in the action. I love noting more than to see a woman who is more than just eye candy to the action hero (but she does do eye candy very well).Another highlight for me is one of The Antagonist's henchmen Sunny played by Andy Oh. He spoke a lot of English in the film for reasons I did not fully get, but this may have help with me relating to the character, as I did not have to read what he was saying, but the fight scene between he and The Don was brilliant.Once again the Don delivers a worth wild Action flick, to add on to the many reasons why Hollywood does a disservice to itself sleeping on his skills, but it's probably for the best as an American made Special ID just would not be the same."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"The six years since 'Ip Man', Donnie Yen has not looked back on the kind of contemporary action that fuelled his latest career resurgence, preferring instead historical epics like 'Bodyguards and Assassins', 'Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen' and 'Wu Xia'. No wonder then fans of 'S.P.L.' and 'Flash Point' have been waiting in eager anticipation for his return to MMA-type action that this latest 'Special ID' promises, in particular since Donnie himself has promised this to be the epitome of the techniques he had used in his earlier two movies.Good news is that Donnie doesn't disappoint - as the action director and of course his own choreographer, he makes great use of the tight enclosed quarters of the sets to stage some thrilling MMA fights. Right from an invigorating opening that pits him against veteran Jackie Chan stunt team member Ken Lo in an old-school mah-jong parlour, it's clear Donnie is going for the jugular when it comes to his blows, kicks and head-locks. This is none of that poetic grace we saw in 'Wu Xia' or restraint in the 'Ip Man' movies; rather, this is no holds barred Donnie, and boy is it awesome to watch him in full macho mode.And throughout the 100-minute run time, Donnie gets to go ballistic twice more - once in the middle when he first confronts his protégé turned arch-nemesis Sunny (Andy On) and again right at the end where the two go mano-a-mano against each other. Both are unique in themselves; whereas the first sees Donnie take on dozens of Sunny's lackeys on his own (think Donnie's one against many in 'Ip Man 2') within the narrow confines of a two-storey restaurant and its kitchens, the second gives Donnie more latitude to brawl with a well-matched opponent both in attitude as well as in ferocity.Impressive though they may be, we do have a few caveats to make. One, much as Donnie had wanted to top what he accomplished in 'S.P.L.' and 'Flash Point', the truth of the matter is that you're probably not going to be wowed to the same extent as watching Donnie go up against Wu Jing in 'S.P.L.' or against Collin Chou in 'Flash Point'. Despite packing bare-knuckled brutality, it lacks the 'oomph' to make it a contender amongst Donnie's best fights. Two, despite adding Collin to the cast as the head of the mafia clan Donnie's Zhilong is infiltrated into, there is no match-up between Donnie and Collin - which in itself is already a disappointment. And lastly, even though Donnie had wanted a female Michelle Yeoh in Mainland star Tian Jing, the actress is largely unremarkable in the few scenes she gets to show off her moves.Now that we've covered the failings in the action department, it's probably opportune to talk about the rest of the movie, which can be summed up in a single word - dreadful. Let's start with the script by the late veteran Hong Kong screenwriter Szeto Kam Yuen, who had also penned Donnie's 'S.P.L.' and 'Flash Point' - while the former two shrewdly chose a simple but tightly wound narrative around the action, 'Special ID' sees Yuen channelling 'Infernal Affairs' into its story of an undercover cop who wants out but is forced to take on one last mission by his superior (played here with comic but unconvincing effect by Ronald Cheng). Not only is Zilong's character arc of a tortured cop clichéd, it is tacked on with an equally hackneyed pseudo-romance between Zilong and his Mainland partner Fang Jing (Tian Jing) from which he is supposed to find a sense of composure to his brash aggressive self.It might have been better if a stronger director was at the helm; unfortunately, the person behind the camera was also behind Donnie's most atrocious movie in recent years 'Together'. We're talking of Clarence Fok, best known for his work on the 1992 Wong Jing scripted film 'Naked Killer'; here, Fok literally 'f**ks' up the direction with poor continuity between scenes, annoying fadeouts and most of all, a utter lack of coherence in the tone of the movie - the latter in fact is particularly ingratiating, as Fok reveals yet again how he has utterly no clue how to build a credible romantic arc, in this case between Zilong and Fang Jing.But Fok's shortcomings don't stop there - there is absolutely no subtlety in the entire movie, so much so Donnie ends up embarrassing himself by overacting in every single dramatic scene. Fok even manages to screw up Donnie's transformation from impulsive to out-of-control, a supposed crucial turning point in the story where Zilong's dual identity catches up with him and exacts a punishing toll on the one sole family member he has left - his mother (Paw Hee Ching); as it is, the ending that sees Donnie chasing Sunny down the roads of Shenzhen is rushed and jarring, another frustrating sign of incompetence by a director who should have stayed in retirement.No thanks to multiple shortcomings, 'Special ID' ranks as a queer disappointment. Sure, one goes to a Donnie Yen film for the action, which he does deliver to good - though not great - effect; but there need at least be a competent story to form the narrative glue in between the fights, which in this case is sorely lacking. If Donnie is listening, we'd also advise him to simply stick with dubbing or with his native Cantonese tongue for his next movies - let's just say that his Cantonese-accented Mandarin is quite the unintentional cringer here."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Upon its release, Special ID got slammed by critics and fans for many reasons!It seems that with Donnie, who is arguably the hardest working man in Asia at the moment, that his latest few years of film work has been very hit and miss for most. Not myself. I take each film for what it is...But you have the new fans, who have joined the band waggon since Ip Man came out, and you have us regular fans who have been watching Donnie for 30 years now. The new fans just want more Ip Man. Most people, like myself, respect what is delivered!Donnie's film roles overlap many historic moments up to playing the ass kicking modern day cop, without falling in to the stereotype that most stars have. So with Special ID, it was refreshing to see a little humour and a lot more smiling from him.I love director Clarence Fok's films. He is corny and off the wall, and does many wild things with his stars. In Special ID, he does not disappoint!Yes its not perfect, but here we have an action packed, ass kicking return to the late 80's/early 90's of Hong Kong cinemas golden age, and it does the job nicely.Special ID is worth the watch. And not just once!"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"""Special ID"" (or ""Te Shu Shen Fen"") is not your average Donnie Yen movie, where he takes on the entire world and lives to tell the tale. This is a more down to Earth kind of movie, with the right amount of action thrown into the mixture.The story is about an undercover police man whose cover is on the line as he has to unravel a gang to expose the leader. But when his former friend and protégé shows up, things take an unforeseen turn.I will say that the story itself was fairly mediocre, and there wasn't really anything out of the ordinary or anything that hadn't been seen before. But what made it work was the way that the characters were portrayed, as being fairly average people unable to take on a whole gang by themselves.The fight scenes and action scenes were well choreographed and they had a very realistic feeling to them, whereas many Asian action movies tend to go an extra mile and throw a bit too much gasoline on the fire.Donnie Yen seems fairly mellow and lenient in this movie, and it served him well, because it adds a good flavor to the movie, making it more realistic and enjoyable.I am a big fan of Asian cinema, but ""Special ID"" hardly revolutionized the Asian action genre, nor did it push any boundaries. If you enjoy Donnie Yen's movies, then you should take the time to sit down and watch ""Special ID""."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"As a long time fan of Hong Kong movies, it's nice that in recent years Donnie Yen has finally come out on his own as a leading man. While Special ID is not a movie of the same quality as the Ip Man movies starring Donnie or Kill Zone(SPL), I did still enjoy it quite a bit. Directed by Clerence Fok, who is best known for the erotic action cult classic Naked Killer. Donnie is a cop who is deep, deep, deep undercover who wants to be a regular cop and regain his identity. Of course his superiors want him to keep feeding them information and when the crap hits the fan, Donnie Yen fights everyone. To be honest, the story and most of the acting in this action packed thriller is average, but adaquite. Donnie, however is great and the fights are awesome. Donnie makes the combo of stylish martial arts and gritty streetfighting work. I can't regard Special ID as an instant classic, however it is a pretty solid action movie with some great fight scenes. I look forward to see more asskicking from Donnie Yen in the future."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"The last time Donnie Yen officially put mixed martial arts on screen was Flashpoint, which arguably in my opinion was his artistic peak as an action choreographer and on screen fighter. He successfully made real martial arts combat cinematic. The choreography was shot in a way that allowed the viewer to visually break down why move A was countering move B. So with that said, my expectations of the MMA fights coming into Special ID were high. My high expectations aren't out of place. Donnie Yen himself has said he wanted to go further with displaying MMA on film. In Special ID, Yen does this by integrating the urban environment into the choreography. The fights are set in tight spaces and narrow hallways, showcasing the physical precision it required from all the stunt performers. The group fights look convincing. Everything looks less staged and the moves don't land as cleanly, giving a gritty sense of realism. On pure cinematic terms, Yen succeeds. The choreography is another story. The only wee complaint I had about the mixed martial arts choreography in Flashpoint was that Donnie Yen was the only one who fought with MMA techniques. Everybody else was essentially a kickboxer fighting the main character that had groundwork and wrestling skills up his sleeve. I let that go for Flashpoint, but in Special ID it has now officially become problematic. This makes me think that Yen was solely concerned with making himself look good on screen. Yen has been guilty of this in the past but this is too blatant. Yen's fight with Ken Lo, a stuntman popular for being the villain from Jackie Chan's Drunken Master 2, is one such example. There were moments designed in their fight that purposely made Ken Lo look clumsy and stupid. Anybody who has seen Ken Lo in an on screen fight will know that he is anything but clumsy. Don't get me wrong, these are good fights. They are are tense and grueling, but it's too dramatically convenient if only the hero knows Brazilian Jujitsu and all the villains have no knowledge of countering it.Much of the story problems -and there are many- with Special ID are the common problems I have with current Mainland-Hong Kong co-productions. There's a penchant for shooting dialogue scenes in a perfectly decorated restaurant or apartment. No matter what happened in the scene before, the actors are always seated perfectly still reflecting upon what happened. The dialogue is often on-the-nose that is stating things that the filmmakers are supposed to be showing. It is television-like and I don't know why it is the trend. The dialogue scenes in Special ID are plodding and murder every sense of dramatic tension. It's a narrative mess.The female police officer character played newcomer Jing Tian was a severe plot contrivance and another example of a bad Mainland film trope. Her character Fang Jing was constantly spewing preachy dialogue about how police work should be ideally done, and acted too naive to be a convincing policewoman. It's like her character was written to secure an approval from the Chinese Film Bureau. She had too much screen time and it was like watching Hello Kitty fight crime. I particularly hated the manipulative choppy musical score. It was in the vibes of ""Hey, it's time to feel this emotion now!"" One minute there's the metal music for the fights, and then the next minute it's pensive piano music when Jing Tian yaps on about following rules is the key to a good life. Collin Chou shows up for what ends up being a disappointing role. It's actually a cheap marketing ploy to tease the martial arts film fans that there is going to be a fight at some point in the story. Collin Chou and Donnie Yen have fought before, so as fans we expect there will be something that will at least try to top the Flashpoint fight. But sadly, that didn't happen. After that, I was only half awake for the final showdown with Andy On. I'd recommend people see Flashpoint again. Sure, the plot wasn't anything new, but Wilson Yip told a proper story. He gave little dramatic touches to the heroes and villains, which created proper stakes and made me care about the characters. Special ID has no developed characters, plot or any sense of flow or consistency. This was a perfectly marketed soulless product designed to take our money. And it was just plain mean-spirited.I will probably watch Special ID again, but probably only the fight scenes in the form of online Youtube clips. I like these fights, but wished they belonged in a better movie. Special ID was just all flash, but without the ""point"". For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Weak action film is far from Donnie Yen's best.The plot has Yen as a deep cover cop battling a crime lord.I interviewed Donnie Yen when this film played at the New York Chinese Film Festival in November 2013 and before I could say anything about the film, or anything t all, Yen began talking about how disappointed he was in the film. He went on to talk about how the film was put together the wrong way and was doomed never to work. He seemed to be distancing himself from the film, which was strange since no one at the festival had seen it yet. You know a film can't be really good if its star bad mouths it.Actually the film is't horrible. The plot is a mess but the action mostly works and sometimes that's enough. In the present case it's almost enough, certainly the film would be worth seeing streaming or as a loaner, anything so long as you're not paying much to see it.Donnie's done mostly better and he's done worse."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Thought I'd give this movie a hand, a long-time IMDb user, creating an account just because I'm outraged at the bad press this movie is getting here!After SPL and Flash Point, this movie fits right into its sub-genre, which Donnie Yen is pioneering and he is going to be known for the choreography work he is doing in these movies in years to come.Some of the review to this movie are phenomenally unfair. People are considering Sha Po Lang as a benchmark, and while it had great fighting scenes, it was incredibly over-dark. Flashpoint starts with the development of MMA in fight scenes, and does a great job, although the final action scene was really long. This film has some of the best fight scenes seen in a long while and it really brings MMA to the screen in an exciting and new way. (The guy who says Yen is the only one who knows ground-work in the movie wasn't watching, it seems.)Not only that, the colours and the settings are grand, the first scene in a Kowloon-looking gangster hangout is fantastic, and there is a great scene in a restaurant as well.The action is visually beautiful and emotionally tense, a great job with that. Maybe the car chase scene is a bit long, there is some Chinese cheesiness with the conversations with the female character, but it brings the action forward and Andy On is a great bad guy. Maybe the storyline unfolds quickly and not all the elements are there, but the characterisation of Donnie Yen's character is new and interesting, though they play on old HK conventions.In short, this is a GOOD action movie for people who like martial arts movies and cop movies. Yen is reviving the police dramas that Honk Kong hasn't been doing well for a few years now (Johnnie To and Dante Lam being the exceptions). It is great fun, with great shots and even its music is not bad!Thank you Donnie, for making action movies that are fresh, new and cool!"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Pardon for my bad English, I am not writing a full review but only posting some of my personal thoughts after watching the movie.1. The trailer spoils some of the exciting fight scenes in this movie. 2. Lower your expectation and you will still be entertained. 3. Not quite the martial art movie if you come all the way from SPL and Flashpoint 4. The fighting choreography does not come from Donnie Yen himself, I suppose. 5. The fighting is realistic, however, more true to the real street fighting than ever. 6. The car chasing scenes and the stunts are awesome, better than the fight, maybe. 7. Not a bad story, but without twist and very straight forward. You will not get the same story impact and the strong feeling for vengeance like SPL and Flashpoint. 8. I am a little disappointed that the final battle does not carry the same furiousness I experienced from SPL and Flashpoint. 9. Having saying that, it makes both SPL and Flashpoint a classics. 10.I should have just give it a 5-star, but 1 more star to salute Donnie Yen for trying something new, trying to create another variant to his already awesome movie collections.My rating : 6/10PS I found that the Young Detective Dee is a more entertaining movie if you want some cool fights."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Oh dear, this is really sad. Following something of a career revival with the outstanding Sha Po Lang, Ip Man and Wu Xia, Donnie Yen has really been unable to maintain the quality of his efforts. I fear he is slowly falling back to the ranks of cheesy unrespected action movies with which he had been associated for most of his career. With The Last Bladesman, The Return of Chen Zhen, 14 Blades and now Special ID, he's been having more misses than hits.When teasers for Special ID started to appear, Internet excitement started to mount that this could be the sequel to SPL that we had all hoped Flash Point would have been. Alas, that is not the case.Yen plays undercover cop Dragon Chan, doing the usual bad guy routine to get into the good books of the triad bosses. When trouble starts to brew in China with connections to one of his former underlings, his boss, Captain Cheung (Ronald Cheng), sends Yen out to work with Mainland Chinese police to crack the case. One last case before he can return to being a normal beat cop. Sounds good on paper but the execution is a sad state of affairs.In China, Yen uses his usual unorthodox methods to meet up and reacquaint with his old buddy turned crime boss, Sunny (Andy On). Yen, predictable for a movie, is an unpredictable and reckless cop, which rubs his China police partner Fang Jing (Tian Jing) the wrong way. This is intended to introduce some spark and chemistry between the two but sadly falls flat, mostly due to the fact that Tian Jing looks like she's about 12 years old besides Donnie.Of course while out in China, some rather unnecessary twists are introduced to keep things exciting, but they just didn't work and really didn't make a lot of sense.In the end, what we have is an extremely forgettable action movie and another strike out for Yen. What I liked about this movie was Tian Jing, with some of the best stunts in the movie and a memorable car chase sequence; she stole the best scene in the movie. Agreed she appears too small and frail to pose any real danger. She is, however, surprisingly quite convincing as a martial artist, exhibiting some pretty fancy and gutsy moves.I look forward to seeing her in Jackie Chan's upcoming Police Story 2013. What I didn't like was Donnie Yen's character. It is repeatedly reiterated that Yen's character is stupid but he can fight. We're no longer in the 80s where an action hero can get by just on brawn. No one wants to root for a stupid character but unfortunately that's how Yen's character is written. This is a far cry from Yen's character in SPL, a smart, super cool detective who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Yen's character in this is just a silly caricature, like something out of a kid's movie. Also worthy of note is the criminal underuse of Collin Chou. Nope, no Donnie vs Collin this time.Andy On is pretty good as the bad guy and did a decent job of making his fights against Yen believable. Though what was not believable was why he would be doing all the dirty work himself if he was such an up and coming big-time crime boss, surely he would have sent some of his lackeys to take care of business.Agreed, no one comes to a Donnie Yen movie expecting Shakespeare, they want to see some ass kicking. So how are the action scenes? Again, mediocre at best. The earlier fights were sloppy, likely in an attempt to make our protagonist appear human and vulnerable. Later fights improve somewhat but could have been cut and pasted from so many other generic action movies. The final fight is good but a lot of us would have already seen it in the most recent extended trailer.Special ID is a pretty solid disappointment on all levels. What I loved about both SPL and Wu Xia is that they were both powerful dramas, the fighting was restrained and there were actually only a few fight sequences. This served to make the movies more believable and actually made the action sequences more memorable and impactful.I can't bring myself to recommend this. Rather I recommend, if you haven't seen SPL – go and get it now!Rating 5 out of 10.FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"bad casting, directing and worst of all, the careless decision by using the every actor's original voice. how could it possible that the mother's tone and accent is pure mandarin Chinese, a northern dialect accent, while the son speaking in cantonese accented Chinese? unless this so-called undercover son is adopted by a hongkongness foster parents and later reunited with his real mother, we could never get used to such big difference of accents between mother and son. and then, this guy's superior officer, my, is such a bad cast, who not in the least like a pencil pusher high ranking police office but an accounting clerk. then, the other two gang-bangers' stereo types are so lame and so formulaic, no big difference from their other roles in so many similar genre movies. i just wish donnie yen and all the cast in this movie speaking pure cantonese that at least the whole movie might look more convincing. but the stupid production people decided to cast a fragile Chinese doll to be the case officer from the mainland china and forced a awkward and embarrassing romance between the hongkongness undercover and her, their scenes just looked so contrite and unnatural. the mother role was also a cast of totally unnecessary. the dialog is also so stupid and contrite. this movie in general is a disaster from the very beginning to the end, simply ruined by a stupid screenplay, wrong cast, wrong accents, wrong arrangements almost every thing. to me, giving this movie 3 stars is already over-rated."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"A lot of criticism has been raised at SPECIAL ID for its production problems, resulting in a slightly choppy, hastily put-together movie and a story that isn't entirely satisfying. To be honest, none of this stuff bothers me when I watch an action or martial arts film; all I care about is the calibre of the action. After all, who watches something like WARRIOR KING for the story? The good news is that SPECIAL ID is a film packed with the best kind of action pulled off by Hong Kong producers: wonderful car chases, hard-hitting martial arts fights, and all manner of bruising brawls and showdowns. I could care less about the story, as long as I see Donnie kicking ass in a well-choreographed way, and SPECIAL ID gives us ample opportunity to see the star at his best.Okay, this film isn't of the calibre of KILL ZONE, or FLASHPOINT. But then, I didn't expect it to be; few films are. Instead, it's a decent thriller with some cracking and spectacular action scenes destined to be enjoyed over and over again. I really enjoyed watching it, and if that makes me an undemanding viewer, then so be it."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"The Hong Kong film industry is a mixed bag with one side of the spectrum containing half decent films with fairly good acting and plot, and the other side containing complete and utter tosh story lines with the only redemption being the fighting. Hong Kong triad films (of which there are millions which gives you an indication of the type of people you will find in Hong Kong...) mostly fall into the 2nd tosh category. The only exception was Indecent Proposal... I mean, Internal Affairs 1 (and possibly 2...) which someone in America loved so much that they did an American version.Donnie Yen has also starred in million of Hong Kong films. As someone mentioned, his career is also the same mixed bag. In recent years he has been involved in some respectful titles (Yip Man, Return of Chen Zhen, Painted Skin and Dragon Tiger gate amongst others). The problem is, he is known for his martial arts ability and poorly underused (or recognised) for his acting.But I can't help but feel that he has been forced into being in this film. No-one in their right mind would choose to be in this pile of rubbish, much less a HK A-star.Personally, there was one good thing about this movie. Despite being utter rubbish and a waste of 90 minutes it is STILL better than the rubbish that is called Iron Man 3, and that is why I gave Special ID 2/10. God knows how that other rubbish ended up as top grosser of 2013..."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"You have to have a special place for Donnie Yen and not be too cynical about this movie to enjoy it. I'll give you that, but the action, when it is on screen is impeccable. He still knows how to do things properly. And I think he also has the charisma to elevate mediocre movies like this above their level.The fighting almost seems realistic (apart from the one at a time attacking of the bad guys, which every action movie has) and the scenes are well choreographed. It's not only action though, as this tries to tell a story. A very predictable one, but that shouldn't put you off the movie. A nice action movie that might please Donnie Yens fan base until his next movie comes out"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Chan (Donnie Yen) is in a gang. He is a fighter. He also works for the police in a role that appears to be half informant and half policeman. Both the police and his gang wants him to go to Nanhai on the mainland to meet with Sunny, a bad guy who may have stolen from another gang. Chan works with police woman Fang Jing (Tian Jing) the Lara Croft of China. He gets a ""special ID"" on the mainland, one that didn't matter because he is an old friend of Sunny anyway.The movie has a lot of kick boxing, including women and an elderly woman getting beat up. The film is in subtitles and a lot is lost in the translation. There is some comedy and romantic banter that goes on between the two main characters, at least the soundtrack seems to imply this, yet the dialouge is neither romantic nor funny. At one point a woman yells at Chan ""Speak Mandarin!"" Apparently he was speaking in a different dialect so she couldn't understand the conversation, yet it all sounded the same to me and you couldn't tell it was different by the subtitles.Most of the fighting was normal. Tian Jing however exhibits some extraordinary jumping skills. The film is deeper than an action film as it gives a message about character growth, which seemed out of place.This is not a film for me.Parental Guidance: F-bomb in what appears to be two Chinese dialects. No sex or nudity."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Donny Yen is a very good fighter and always delivers solid sequences. But he's not a Jackie Chan.The story was thin and very sanitized. Blood but a lack of grit. Guess that's the pitfalls of making movies in a communist country.I believe I can describe Chinese movie storytelling but really can't explain it. Very cursory in character development. Extended, detailed and often very impressive action sequences. But, in the end, they are often very similar to each other.The reason you watch a Donny Yen movie is the fights. And he generally delivers. I'd watch another one from him but they are not gold like John Woo movies."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Decent but script is a bit all over the place. Didn't flow overly well. Good action fight sequences , ok car chase. Donnie yen fans can give a watch, but I'd recommend kung Fu jungle(killer) instead."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"As an American watching these overseas foreign films was never my cup of tea. However, since the action genre has really slowed down since the nineties, watching films from overseas is a must these days. I'm a huge fan of action films, and action films that either have a lot of fighting scenes or just action scenes in general. This film not only has amazing hand to hand combat, but chase scenes as well. This is my review of Special ID.Some longtime action fans may know the names of the stars and the director, but since I'm fairly new to overseas films of this genre I'm basically a beginner, so forgive me if I get anything wrong. This film was directed by Clarence Fok Yiu-leung. While I'm not up to date on his filmography whether he has made other good films in the past, I can honestly say he does an amazing job in directing this film. The film starts out with a little action scene, hand to hand combat, and the scene is just amazing. You never really get action like this anymore here in the states. While the film really follows a basic and overused plot, the intense action save the film from being average at best. Even though there are not tons of action scenes in the film, when the action breaks out, it usually last a good bit. Case in point being the action scene to end the film. The scene was incredible and last a good ten to fifteen minutes. Some cheap CG is used as well, but you only really notice it a couple times during the film.Overall, if you just like watching action films like I do, then this film is clearly for you. Do not let the fact that it is a foreign film turn you off. The action scenes are intense, and last far longer than our American action scenes. A popular streaming service just added this film to watch(won't mention name as I'm only here to reviews films and not sell things to people), so look it up and give it a watch. I highly recommend it.7/10"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Donnie Yen's name usually mean the movie is gonna be pretty fun, i own several of his movies and despite not all of them being masterpieces, at least there entertaining. Then there the kind of Ip Man 1 and 2 which are just awesometacular movies.This one i heard suffered from a lot of problems on set and it show. First of all the story is completely messed up. The movie try at some point to make you feel for these characters, but somewhat for a major part of the movie its just too hard. You just follow and ask yourself who is this...? Protagonist appears left and right and you just get the basic of the story. I never got into the story, as why this guy is a bad guy, why he is doing what he does, and they kinda try to establish a connection with some characters with minimal back story flashbacks but there so few of them it basically just tell you that protagonist 1 knows antagonist 1.How about the martial arts you would say? Well, its really hit or miss, some scenes where pretty good while others where cringe worthy... Special effects even tough rarely used are terrible when they happen.In the end considering i didn't had a terrible time, but was not either that much into the movie, i will give it a slightly average score of 6.Donnie's acting help him get 1 more points..."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Another offering from poor-man's kung-fu megastar Donnie Yen's 'Special ID'. This is very much standard Donnie Yen fayre for me: a lot of action, little real need for plot and leaves you feeling entertained, not deep in contemplative thought.Playing an undercover policeman who has been written by someone who has seen 'Infernal Affairs', Yen travels to the mainland from Hong Kong to track down an old acquaintance and essentially bring him down. Cue some pretty impressive fight scenes (some interesting mixed-martial arts action) and some nicely filmed action scenes and you have your lot. Much like many action films you can watch these days, there is a sense that you can feel desensitised to what you see before you. But, every now and again, I do get the sense of having seen some well done stunt work that does need some applauding. This has that: while not exactly groundbreaking, it does deserve some recognition in parts. With Donnie Yen, you get what you pay for. politic1983.blogspot.co.uk"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Whether you are a fan of martial arts, or simply enjoy action films in general, Special ID is sure to entertain, with a story about family, honor, betrayal, vengeance and retribution.Donnie Yen portrays Chan, an undercover police officer who has partially forgotten how it is to be a cop, his fellow officers having great trouble controlling his actions. Though he may have difficulty reading the police officer's code of conduct, when it comes to reading a situation, Chan is unmatched, his adeptly beneficent capabilities allowing him to often remain a step ahead of his opposition.As always, Mr. Yen is wickedly entertaining, his unparalleled skill, breathtaking confidence and entertaining charisma allowing him to uniquely command the screen with physical precision and credible skill. The jaw dropping, awe inspiring fight scenes are as captivating as they are brilliant, the use of sound really heightening the violence sustained during the confrontations. Not only this, the camera-work is as equally amazing at capturing the moment, not to mention the richness of the metropolitan environments the film is set in.When a crime boss is violently killed, Chan is tasked not only by the underworld gang he is associated with, but by the police, to investigate Sunny (Andy On), a former brother in arms suspected of complicity in the murder. To assist in his endeavors, the police pair Chan with Jing, portrayed by the incredibly ravishing and unfathomably gorgeous Tian Jing, the use of occasional humor, coupled with the reliable character chemistry delivering a fistful of fun.As fellow members of the underworld begin to grow suspicious of Chan, his thoughts begin to dwell towards the safety of his mother, Amy (Hee Ching Paw). Wanting to escape the criminal world and return to the life of an officer, Chan needs to solve this one last case, where every move he makes, could unfortunately be his last.Story-wise, Special ID may not be uniquely imaginative, though it makes up for this with its characterization, alongside the use of tension and suspense. Although the first half of the feature is excellent, somewhere between this segment and the film's final quarter, the movie seems to lose pace, the daring fight scenes becoming more infrequent.The concluding battle will certainly remind viewers of Flashpoint, and the inclusion of a fantastically choreographed car scene will inevitably dazzle the senses. Moreover, Ms. Jing's capability to perform her own stunts stress her proficiency and flexibility. This aside, her character deserved more screen time, although I may be quick to argue this idea because by the end of the feature, I needed a towel to wipe the drool off my chin.Regardless of whether you appreciate superb fight sequences, brilliant stunts, entertaining gun fights, police drama, or ogling beautiful Chinese women, Special ID will satisfy any action movie enthusiast's appetite."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Undercover cop? CheckTriads? CheckA hot chick? CheckThis is just a very very typical HK action movie involving an undercover cop and a bunch of gangsters. The action isn't really that good to be honest and Donnie Yen is kinda repeating the exact same moves he does in every other film. Example include demonstrating his MMA abilities as well his his jumping back kick.It isn't a bad film, but it isn't really interesting too. Also it has a cheesy ass ending with Donnie Yen (possible using his real life house as a set) celebrating and picking up the hot chick spinning her around.Anyways, if you really just like anything Donnie Yen does then you will like this, but this is far from IP Man 1, Hero, Once Upon a Time in China 2, and so on.5/10."
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"I didn't know what I was getting into- my fault. I have never been and never will be a fan of Jackie-Chan style martial arts films. I was viewing this after seeing darker, more complex films like Cold War, Overheard, Blind Detective, etc. Special ID is slap-in-the-face straightforward in comparison. Donnie Yen as a roughneck is a hard sell. I did like his storyline, trying to become a cop, and I loved Fang Jing's fight scenes -it's past time for a modern action heroine; give her a movie!- and most of the fight scenes. I noticed the MMA immediately. Well done. His relationship with his mom was really touching too. I always appreciate Andy On, and he did a great job as well. So not bad if you know what you're getting into, and you like that kind of thing. Just be aware this is a little more explicitly violent in places. Sometimes the director takes great pains to show punches connecting in a way that is not even visible in real life, considering the speed of a punch or kick. (I don't really like this slow-mo detail. It felt gratuitous.)"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Donnie Yen...why?This movie's advertising made me want to see this movie so badly, the trailer looked good! The fight scenes looked great in the trailer but it turns out it was just a disappointment as I was looking forward to a movie with fights like Yen's other movie, ""Flash Point"". Maybe, that's why I didn't enjoy it as I wanted to see a great fight between Donnie and Collin Chou or Andy On, but found that this ""mixed martial arts"" that Donnie used was a mess and nope, no Collin vs Donnie Part II.The story line is really predictable and boring and Donnie is portrayed as a literally stupid character who knows how to fight. Donnie's first fight near the start of the movie was a big disappointment as Donnie literally just crawls around on the ground the whole time fighting Ken Lo's character, during a mah jong game. If you are going to watch this movie and expect ""Sha Po Lang"" or ""Flash Point"", you will be disappointed. If you are a Donnie Yen fan and expect to see some good acting, you might be disappointed. If you see this and lower your expectations, you might not be disappointed!"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"If you go into this movie to watch an action flick you'll get that. It has great, brutal action choreography. It's what you expect from Donnie Yen. But it was kind of disappointing that they didn't really do much with a certain martial arts actor (Don't want to spoil it). I wanted that actor to do more but he doesn't get that much screen time. There were some scenes of dialogue that made the movie feel slow and I would've cut those scenes out and have more fights."

He fight like he doesn't know kungfu. fight like gangster knows only how to kick and punch and chop with knife. and the worse.. Ground Fighting make me want to walk out of cinema. In every martial art the ground fighting is what i hate the most. its not even art.Don't expect much like flash point or IP MAN. but still have one thing that make me sit tight . the girl!!. she is so pretty. i forgot the name"
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,This is the most real and authentic martial arts action movie i have seen in the past ten years - the camerawork is fantastic - the acting is great - the action scenes are something else - not only are they entertaining in a style similar to jackie chan but they are brutal - good story - cant say anything bad about this movie - except i wish they would make a sequel - unbelievable action sequences i have not seen alike since the days of early jackie chan - donnie yen is something else - check it out - you wont be disappointed *****(my favourite part is the gang fight scene around the 31 minute mark where donnie yen is kicking everyone's a$$)
特殊身份,Special ID (2013),,2013,2013.10.18,"Let's just say I know Special ID by heart now! After watching Donnie for 3 straight screenings, I recommend fans take another look at this film. So some spoilers here! The storyline was simple but the action fits the storyline. When you first watch Special ID, like any movie, you may miss some details. So it was exciting to see the ""why"" behind a character and the action. I thought it was mad funny how ever time he went to meet with the other gangs, he always got in trouble or had to fight his way out. He could never just leave. So this confirmed his mother's statement in how he is always getting in or causing trouble. I agree with Donnie. I wish they had not edited the relationship his character had with his mother. I had a lot of favorite and funny moments I liked. But two of my favorite lines was one when his mother said, ""I've always wanted to protect you"", when she revealed that she knew for years he was undercover. That was very heart-warming. The second, when his superior told him what his role will be when he went to the Mainland for the case. He whispered in his ear ""Special ID"" and Donnie's character responds, ""What the hell is that?"" Mad funny! Special ID reminded me of Donnie's ""In the Line of Duty"", ""Tiger Cage"" and ""Cheetah on Fire"" days for someone reason but just updated, more modern. In spite of the negative reviews from the get go, which was such an injustice and may have prematurely tainted fans opinion about the film, I predict Special ID is going to find a following in spite of its limited release."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I'm not terribly familiar with Johnnie To's work, though I know he is one of China's biggest directors. Drug War is his latest film, a critically hailed masterpiece, so to speak, that rivals some of the best American crime films. And for the most part, it is a very good film. Gripping, with a tight rope plot written like a maze, Drug War very rarely lets up as it navigates from one stage of the plot to the other.The film opens with Timmy Choi, a drug manufacturer, driving erratically until he runs through the entrance of a restaurant until he ends up in the hands of Captain Zhang. For dealing the amount of drugs that Choi is responsible for, the penalty is death, but Choi cuts a deal to help the police bring down a drug lord responsible for the sale of the narcotics. What follows is a near non-stop mission to get into the heart of the drug dealers and bring them down.Drug War is the kind of crime action thriller that is very audience pleasing. There is plenty of suspense and mystery, as you're always on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what will happen next. It doesn't help that you're never quite sure who to trust or who will do what, especially Choi, who remains shifty and unsure. Sun Honglei is especially entertaining as the no nonsense Zhang, whose smart and constantly does his best to stay one step ahead of all those he's trying to bring down, including Choi. The writing for the film is very intricate and full of surprises. Coupling this are several action set pieces, the highlight of which are a middle section involving the police and two very capable partners of Choi and the ending, which is an absolutely crazy finale for this film.If I have one real complaint about the film, it's the lack of depth. For all the technical skill and excellent writing and plot, we really don't get to know any of our characters. There is an attempt to make Choi somewhat sympathetic through a plot point about his wife, but Choi himself never really does much to make us like him or get us on his side. The same can be said about Zhang, who is little more than a hard nose cop trying to catch the criminals. There's never any real insight into either of these men, let alone the rest of the cast. It's a very basic and shallow cops and criminals tale, albeit, a very well written and produced one.But these are minor complaints in the face of the entertainment at hand. This is arguably one of the best films of 2013, even at it's rating, and I urge anyone looking for to make up for some theatrical thuds to check this out. It's well worth it."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"For the uninitiated, 'Drug War' marks acclaimed Hong Kong director Johnnie To's first crime thriller to be shot in Mainland China, an understandably wary prospect considering how his usual sensibilities in the genre are highly likely to run afoul of the Chinese censors. But fans of the auteur can rest easy – To is as sharp as he has ever been here reuniting with his regular screenwriter and producer Wai Kar-Fai, delivering a tense and engrossing procedural around a complex anti-drug trafficking police operation.To be sure, the subject matter is an extremely risky one – after all, the tough stance that the country has adopted towards drugs means that the authorities are only going to scrutinise a movie about that hot- button topic very, very closely. It is therefore somewhat of a miracle that To manages to remain politically correct without ever being preachy, and even better, to mirror the authorities' no-nonsense approach while offering the kind of nail-biting entertainment perfectly accessible to mainstream audiences.But then again, we should have expected no less from To, and right from the get-go, we are treated to both Wai Kar-Fai's elegant storytelling and To's classy direction. Cross-cutting seamlessly between two seemingly unrelated series of events, To introduces his audience to Louis Koo's Timmy Choi, who is seen driving away from a factory billowing in smoke while foaming at the mouth, gradually losing consciousness until finally he crashes in spectacular fashion through the glass walls of a restaurant. Meanwhile, Sun Honglei's Zhang is on a dilapidated bus going through a toll booth, whose commuters are really mules transporting drug-packed ovules within their body.When his partner-in-crime panics after their overheated bus pulls to the side just after crossing the booth, Zhang reveals himself to be no less than the very captain of the narcotics squad. At the same hospital where Zhang and the other drug mules painfully excrete their smuggled goods, Zhang runs into an unconscious Choi, covered in skin lesions and bearing the unmistakable whiff of a drug-making operation. Immediately, Choi is put into surveillance, but Choi's identity only becomes clearer when he is brought into questioning, turning surprisingly compliant as he tells Zhang that he is but a middleman between a rich businessman turned drug dealer Boss HaHa (Hao Ping) and a powerful supplier named Uncle Bill.Even then, Choi remains an enigma – we're sceptical of his plea to escape the death penalty in exchange for his cooperation – and yet a cautious alliance emerges between the tough grim-faced Zhang and the persuasively suppliant Choi. Keeping the proceedings entirely realistic, To unspools the action through a series of undercover infiltrations, surveillance and stake-outs filmed with the same breakneck urgency and unnerving tension of such real-life operations. Moving from posh hotels to lavish cabaret nightclubs to busy seaports, To switches from location to location without any let-up from a consistently gripping pace.Yet despite the breakneck pace, each sequence is tautly choreographed. Particularly effective is the pivotal setpiece in the middle section, which sees Zhang masquerading first as Uncle Bill to meet Brother HaHa and then posing as HaHa (the character's signature hysterical laugh included) to meet Uncle Bill's representative. Both close-quarter setups ripple with edge-of-your-seat tension, with Zhang's charade threatening to unravel itself under the villains' scrutiny. Also worthy of mention is the film's climactic shootout in front of an elementary school, as Choi finally reveals his hand as a cool-blooded conniver interested only in his own self-preservation. Though less violent than the usual To actioners, the action is nevertheless exhilarating in its rawness, with To subverting genre expectations of who dies and who prevails.In true alpha-male fashion, Zhang remains an inscrutable character throughout, defined only by his doggedness when hunting down his targets. Ditto for Choi, who doesn't get any backstory to explain how or why he got into the drug business. Like 'PTU', To keeps his focus singularly on the nuts-and-bolts of the police work at hand, deliberately refusing to let his audience get to know more about any of the characters aside from their relative positions in the unfolding mission. Such a clinical approach may frustrate some viewers, but anyone who's been a fan of his trademark understatement will embrace it – along with Xavier Jameux's pulsing score – as nothing less than To's brand of cool.Just as certain to delight fans is a nifty twist late into the story that turns the movie into a reunion of sorts for To's regulars – Lam Suet, Gordon Lam, Eddie Cheung, Lo Hoi Pang and Michelle Ye. Of course, that's not to diminish Sun Honglei and Louis Koo's strong lead performances – the former bringing gravitas and an unexpected touch of humour when imitating HaHa's over-the-top behaviour to an otherwise stoic role; and the latter playing both cunning and desperate in thoroughly engaging fashion.And so despite the Mainland setting, 'Drug War' remains a distinctly Johnnie To movie, using the bleak wintry settings of the Mainland city of Tianjin to lend the film and its subject matter a gritty sobering feel. Eschewing the visual aesthetics of 'Exiled' and 'Sparrow', it is also easily his most commercially accessible action thriller of late, with a documentary-like realism that mirrors Derek Yee's style in another drug-themed movie 'Protége'. Like we've said, To's fans will enjoy this as much as his previous works, and this is a movie that demonstrates once again why he is easily one of the best directors in Hong Kong today."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Quite a bit I must say, with pros and cons which Drug War seem to be caught under that crossfire. There are a few rules that the Chinese play by, and chief to that is the morals imposed where the bad guys cannot go Scot free. So even without stepping into the cinema, or hear what this film is about, the ending is already cast in stone, which takes a little shine off the fun in being able to follow through the story, and waiting to be surprised at the finale. No matter how tight one's writing can be, it leads to that inevitable finish, so that expectation is quite the bitch.Otherwise, China presents itself a new playground in which filmmakers can go and get their vision presented through landscapes yet to be familiar playgrounds. The filmmakers here have ventured beyond the bigger and well known cities, and opted for smaller second tier ones to present that small town, rustic look where one supposes a crime syndicate could thrive under, and operate without too much attention being paid to it. Until Louis Koo's Cai is seen driving a car in haphazard fashion, suffering from injuries yet to be explained, and setting the stage for something special from the imagination of To and long time collaborator Wai Ka-Fai. That, and a trailer that's making its rounds for a delivery of its cargo, made up of ingredients necessary for the big time production of ketamine.Then we must be introduced to the cops, where the anti-narcotic department is given the spotlight for the film's focus on a drug syndicate. Chinese actor Sun Honglei leads the charge here as the division chief Inspector Zhang, getting introduced as a no-nonsense, hands off type of leader who walks the talk, and never shying away from being in the thick of the action when the need calls for it. In many scenes, it is Sun Honglei's charismatic presence and superb acting that made this watchable, since his character dabbles in a little bit of role play while undercover, utilizing a vast array of skills within his ability to make it convincing not only to the other characters he deals with, but to the audience as well.The crux of the story lies in the power and cat and mouse play that both Zhang and Cai engage in, with the latter under the former's custody, and facing the mandatory death sentence if convicted. Wanting to survive, he strikes a deal with Zhang to allow him access to the bigger fish in the pond, and for Zhang, this is too big an opportunity in his career, and for the wider group of population he serves, to give up. So together with his team, they form an uneasy partnership with Cai, since trust is yet to be earned, suspicion always round the corner that Cai will bolt, and whether they're walking into a known trap set up by him. The story's kept at a steady pace by Johnnie To, keeping things quite cerebral in leaving you wondering about Cai's motivation for the most parts, especially since having to reveal that Cai is quite the slimy, street smart person going all out to ensure his survival.And I suppose a Milkyway crime thriller isn't a Milkyway crime thriller if the usual suspects don't turn up in any capacity. With a relatively fresh faced cast from the Mainland, and with recognizable faces such as Huang Yi playing Sun Honglei's able deputy, it never really feels quite right without To's stable of actors tossed into the mix, and thankfully this is one formula that's being kept. Better yet, this version screened here kept their Cantonese dialogue intact - even Louis Koo was undubbed - and that serves as a more authentic presentation. There's Lam Suet, Eddie Cheung, Lo Hoi Pang, and Lam Ka Tung amongst others who make an appearance, and contribute where it mattered most, allowing reason for fan boys to cheer.There's a wider subtext in the film though, dealing with Hong Kong and China, where the former group sees opportunities in making money in the Mainland, but the message is that collaboration and mutual trust is key. Should one group try to breakaway from an alliance, it serves nobody any advantage, and the outcome may be dire straits. It's an unfair alliance to begin with since there's a larger body involved compared to the smaller partner who's not given a level playing field or too much of a bargaining power, but to play within the rules set will ensure survival.Not since Election 2 has a Johnnie To film been so direct with its metaphors and allegories, and this is what sets Drug War apart from other run of the mill crime thrillers done by other filmmakers. The Milkyway team has ventured into China with their romantic comedies to some degree of success, and they've now shown the way that crime capers also have an avenue in the mainland despite having to play by the rules set by others. This is well worth a watch despite an extended sequence that vaguely resembled something out of MI:4 Ghost Protocol, which is just as gripping as it was opportunity for Sun Honglei to showoff some acting chops, and the expected moans and groans about the ending where To delivers his usual shoot out spectacle to out-gun and outlast any John Woo picture.

毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Johnnie To seems to be one of the most adept directors working in Hong Kong today; in the recent fifteen years or so he's built for himself an impressive body of work, concentrating almost solely in the thriller genre. His films usually involve cops or gangsters, all of them equally tough, and his detailed plots inevitably involve lots of death, betrayal, and bloodshed.DRUG WAR is no different; it's the third To film I've seen, and by far the best. This is a pulse-pounding thriller that moves exceptionally fast, requiring the viewer to pay close attention throughout in order to keep up with everything that transpires. To's requirement above all else is for ultra-realism, making this a low key and often subtle piece of filmmaking, and an exemplary example for Hollywood directors keen to make their wham-bang thrillers.Louis Koo headlines the cast in an intriguing role as a leading drug dealer who's caught by the police and forced to help them bring down some even greater criminals. What this leads to is a unique and fresh-feeling storyline, one that's hard to predict throughout, with the emphasis almost entirely on suspense sequences. Most of the action is limited to the climax, which stages a tense shoot-out on an even more epic scale than the one in HEAT. It's great stuff indeed and the perfect end to a great thriller."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"After his meth lab explodes, leaving him scarred and his wife dead, Timmy Choi (Louis Koo) is apprehended by the Chinese police for a crime that warrants the death penalty. In the custody of Captain Zhang (Sun Honglei), Choi sees only one option to avoid execution; turn traitor and help Zhang's undercover unit bring down the powerful cartel that he has been cooking for. As the stakes get higher, it becomes increasing unclear as to who has the upper hand, and who will dictate the endgame. Director Johnny To is a master of the crime film, and with ""Drug War,"" he's created a near masterpiece of the genre. He never convinces us of being in anything but complete control of his multifaceted thriller, and exudes an unparallelled confidence in every scene and phenomenal set piece.To's electrifying picture recalls some of the best work of his great contemporaries. ""Drug War"" possesses the technical brilliance of Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" the ground-level knowledge and surveillance of David Simon's ""The Wire,"" the gritty realism of Michael Mann's best work, and by the end the blistering, double-fisted action of John Woo's prime. These elements don't come together as a derivative; To is a filmmaker at the top of his game, and makes the most of his cast, his influences, the Mainland setting, and a little of the grotesquerie that often has Hollywood shuddering; in a singular whole. Disparate from most Hong Kong action films, ""Drug War"" is a methodical, meticulous procedural first, exploiting a street-smart screenplay that knows the Chinese crime scene; and if that statement is indeed false, it never feels less than authentic. Much of the intensity derives from dialogue exchanges, and how rigorous both the cops and criminals try to not get made. Because of this well paced, equally well played dynamic, we never know who we should root for, and that's exactly the point. Mr. To's drama is incredibly intense... but then he pulls out all the stops. The last 20 minutes of ""Drug War"" is the show-stopping action set piece of the year. An extended shootout that's brutal, ambitious, and a masterpiece of it's kind. It's a marvel of physical filmmaking that also works as an unexpected plot device, violently flipping our conceived notions of these characters on their ear; clearing the way for a fittingly ironic, ice-cold conclusion.""Drug War"" might just be the best pure crime film of 2013. Technically and narratively stellar, it already seems like a minor classic of the genre."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"The drab, dusty, industrial backdrop of what is purported as the unglamorous metropolis of Tian Jin, China, tacky haute facades are the setting for Drugs War's series of raw, tension filled episodes. From a country riddled with censorship, Drugs Wars, a film by Johnnie To, is an unbridled glimpse of organized crime and crystal meth in China. Although perhaps a tad sensationalistic, the film delivers a bold statement: the Chinese the drug market is alive and well.Louis Koo plays a busted crystal meth baron who has a choice, either help police bust a massive organized crime syndicate, or be executed. He chooses to help police.In an elaborate tireless scheme, actor Honglei Sun dazzlingly plays a police officer portraying a criminal in the attempt to infiltrate this upper echelon syndicate. The best scene of the film is when Sun's character is forced to rail two massive lines of crystal meth as part of this act. The effects of the meth play out into a powerful piece of cinema. Post- OD, literally having come back from the edge death, the chase for the criminals continues with out a flinch.At times this police tenacity is too exaggerated to be believable. The chase for the bad guys goes on endlessly for days. None of the cops ever eat or sleep. They seem to have inexhaustible resources at their disposal. They are able to commandeer an entire harbor just to put on a show of authenticity for the crooks. The cops risk their lives over and over, and for what? To rid the world of a few truckloads of drugs? The conventional divide between the good guy cops and bad guy criminals doesn't blur, until it does. After an epic final gun battle, we have no idea who's who.Drug Wars attains excellence as an action movie and serves as a rare example of a controversial work to emerge from a country that produces so much state-approved propaganda.

毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Legendary director Johnnie To's ""Drug War"" generates a powerful suspense with extended action set-pieces that are truly exceptional, but it's the intense underplayed performances that ultimately leaves its lasting impression. To pulls out all the stops in this high-octane police procedural, shot predominantly in the Jinshan district on the Chinese mainland. This vast, operatic melodrama exhibits some extreme smarts in its bare bones approach to a drug unit's relentless pursuit of a drug cartel. The film proceeds with sequences that establish the war on drugs as neither a heroic crusade, or a hopelessly unwinnable war. They are no metaphors here -- it's a world where people make choices, and as a result, events unfold simply as a matter of process. Manufacturing just fifty grams of meth in China will earn you a death sentence, and Timmy Choi (Louis Koo), manufactures on a massive scale. After a large meth lab explosion, Choi is under arrest and in the custody of Captain Zhang (Sun Honglei). Now he has only one chance to avoid execution: turn informant and help Zhang's undercover team take down the powerful cartel. As the uneasy allies must compress months of police work into just 72 sleepless hours, the increasingly desperate police are quickly stretched past their limits. As things spin wildly out of control, the line between duty and recklessness becomes vague, and it becomes unclear who truly has the upper hand. The first act of ""Drug War"" is an epic manifestation of To's talents: The camera is never in the wrong place, and we're swept effortlessly into the mindsets of a dozen people in the first act with few words or wasted gestures. The film works thanks to the riveting performances of Sun Honglei and Louis Koo. In addition to his two strong leads, To creates a large gallery of dynamic supporting characters, most notably two mute brothers played by Guo Tao and Li Jing who at first appear as comic relief, but eventually play a larger role in the story. The balancing act of the film relies on a long build-up for a large payoff. Director To incorporates just enough action and throughout to keep things interesting before the chaotic, bloody onslaught erupts in the third act. The visceral, brutal shoot-out between opposing sides takes place on a suburban street filled with pedestrians and children. It's intense and unflinching, with a fantastically dark resolution to the story. ""Drug War"" isn't particularly insightful or a profound viewing experience, but those looking for a top-notch thriller will be more than satisfied by this low-key masterpiece."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"A solid, if a tad overlong procedural crime drama anchored by two engaging performances (Sun Honglei, Louis Koo) and masterfully-crafted gunfight scenes.Die-hard fans of Johnnie To's movie who are skeptical of the acclaimed Hong Kong director making his first crime thriller targeted specifically for the Mainland market will be suffered from strict China censorship, can breathe a sigh of relief because DRUG WAR plays like a solid Milkyway production. What's more, it's an engaging Mainland crime thriller that is bold enough to break many taboos -- namely drug abuse and portrayal of graphic violence.Even though DRUG WAR moves in a deliberate pace, its intricate plot to see the way both sides of the Mainland police and the drug dealers going through their working procedures, is often thrilling to watch for -- particularly where Sun Honglei's Captain Zhang goes as far as adopting different personalities (among them is being HaHa) during his elaborate undercover operation.Likewise, the cast is top-notch. Mainland actor Sun Honglei steals the show as the relentless Captain Zhang. Not to forget also is Louis Koo, who is perfectly typecast as the nervous but sneaky Timmy Choi. The rest of the Mainland supporting actors are equally credible, and so does To's Hong Kong regular team members (among them are Lam Suet, Gordon Lam, Michelle Ye, and Eddie Cheung).Two well-staged, yet memorable action scenes are worthy of mentions here. The first one is a brief, but intense shootout sequence between the police squad and two deaf-and-dumb brothers (Guo Tao, Li Jing) in a drug factory. The other one is the brutal open-space gunfight sequence outside the primary school and the highway.Full review at http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/drug-war-2013.html"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I have to confess here in Canada I have no previous exposure to films by Hong Kong directors Johnnie To. Obviously he has done good work before but I just did not have the chance to see them. 'Drug War' was shown in a local art-house cinema and my like-minded friend alerted me to it.Well, this was an interesting film experience - a Hong Kong director doing a police/drug dealer drama based in mainland China. Although other fictitious names were used for the cities, it is obvious the final, major shootout took place in a main street in Tianjin, a large city not far from Beijing. And much has been said about the long, protracted shoot-out scene toward the end, done in the John-Woo-ish manner.I do not know if the version shown in mainland China - apparently the film did well in the box office there - is the same version that I saw in Canada. However, I suspected the China version has to be slightly edited. Still, (Spoiler Alert!) Johnnie To managed to get a film approved for the Chinese audience despite breaking one important rules: four desperadoes gunning down a large number of police officers, male and female. Now this used to be a big no-no in China. The police had to come up on top and the bad guys punished. The mass killing of cops was never presented to any screen in Chinese cinema. And then there is the lesser scene of RMB (Chinese currency) bills being burnt in place of 'ghost money' to honour the dead. Now this may just be part of drama but one can also argue about its possible political significance.All in all, for a cops-against-bad-guys film this is well directed, with action scenes well staged and the cops and criminals well portrayed. There are also finer moments exploring humanity - e.g. a drug dealer's wife, fatally shot, still struggled to put her high-heel boots back on while dodging bullets. The ending is a tad depressing but is mostly likely closer to reality."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Gripping, smart, and a joy to watch. The acting is excellent and the main leads are my favorite. Honglei, a hardened narcotic cop, is collected, methodological, and intelligent. You can tell he has earned his keep and has seen some crazy things behind those eyes. He's like the calm before the storm, readily break loose. He leads a high profiled operation to bust possibly the largest drug ring in the counntry and his lead is Louis, a captured meth supplier. Louis is not to be outshone: calculated, cunning, and above all, selfish. I find his character to be easily one of the greatest villains for he appears harmless but you can't really know what he has in mind. One scene you might think he has repented, another scene he might convince you otherwise. He is a great villain because he's deceptive, cunning, selfish, and he's willing to do anything for survival, including turning against his own kin but the catch is that he doesn't look capable of such evil. That's why he's great. Appearance is deceiving. The two main leads are completely opposite. The cop appears cold, distanced, and seemingly emotionless yet pursues a good cause and cares for his underlings while the crook appears warmer, more expressive, seemingly harmless yet inhuman underneath. Great contrast. The story is tight, the actions are neat - the shootout between the mute brothers and the cops and the grand finale scene are superb. A battle of both brain and brawn."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"So which side is our man on? That's the question in this drug mafia movie where the police have found a way to take down a major drug crew, but have to use one of their key arrests to help them. However, who is he playing for and with? This is a clever and ambitious little movie. Well directed and acted, this film takes influence from others in the genre (such as The Wire) but maps out its own story, and it's really interesting.The Far East has a rich history of mafia movies, and this isn't amongst the classics, but that doesn't devalue it. It still is a fine film, with good directing and acting. Some interesting characters too.Very much worth watching."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Jonnie To cannot do wrong by me. It's not only the perfectly choreographed action scenes, but also the way he depicts the characters in his movies. The story twists are also really good, as in this one, where you get the cat and mouse game between cops and bad guys too. Really good acting in it too.Without going further into the story and without saying there is too much violence in it either (though some might feel that way), I can only tell you that you need a great home system to really enjoy this. While I too compared To to John Woo at first, he has surpassed him and is a brand of his own. This is not his best movie (Election 1+2, Fulltime Killer), but even so a really great one"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Police captain Zhang (played by Sun Honglei) partners with a drug lord named Timmy Choi (played by Louis Koo) after he is arrested. To avoid the death penalty, Choi agrees to reveal information about his partners who operate a cocaine ring. Zhang grows suspicious of Choi's honesty as several police officers began a raid on the drug ring.Drug War is a crime film made and released in Mainland China by a Hong Kong film company. Naturally there is going to be an element of political compromise. All the policemen are Mainland Chinese and all the drug dealers are from Hong Kong (Take a guess which side wins in the end). Nationalism in movies has never really bothered me unless it borders on being disgusting (i.e. Michael Bay's Armageddon). That is not the case here and I don't have a problem with that. My interest is not the politics, but rather what Johnnie To will bring to drug film set in Mainland China. The answer? Not too much.What's missing from Drug War are the Johnnie To quirks. The zany off-the-wall characters who have speech impediments and odd ticks are gone. The dramatic noir lighting, minimalistic stage-like blocking or themes of brotherhood are gone. Even the gunplay is less stylized and presented in a realistic fashion. I don't miss any of these specific quirks or tropes, but without the idiosyncratic Johnnie To stamp, what's left is a very straightforward police procedural.The characters are servicing the plot, which is odd for a Johnnie To film because usually it's the other way round. We don't get insight into the distinct personalities of the drug dealers or police officers and their relationships (like in Election, an ensemble piece where it manages to characterize the supporting characters). We don't know if they have family members or girlfriends waiting for them at home or any backstory. The story is simply moving beat-by-beat linearly on the central question of how trustworthy Louis Koo's drug lord character is. There's nobody you're supposed to be rooting for, but things are continually changing and you simply watch awaiting the final outcome.To, a director and producer with his own production company, has always been best when he has free reign. The limits of To's free reign authorship is that he is very culturally rooted to Hong Kong and possesses a firm voice regarding to its politics (Election), economic condition (Life Without Principle), daily life in Hong Kong (the office politics in Needing You), or even local nostalgia (Throwdown, Sparrow). As exemplified in 2008's Vengeance, a project which was co- financed by French financiers and starred French rock singer Johnny Halliday, To's directorial voice is weaker when he steps outside of his comfort zone. There is no sense of To's personal perspective on the topic of drug running, drug addiction, crime or how the police work in China through the film's story, themes or characters. That makes a bit tame because To has fared much better in the past.In context to Johnnie To's back catalogue, Drug War will be remembered for pushing the boundaries with the Chinese Film Bureau. The Mainland police are shown working undercover and solving crimes, having gun battles with criminals and some even dying in the line of duty; these are all images that were previously not allowed to be shown in a Mainland theatrical release. Yet now we are seeing them on screen. So that is a proper achievement that's worth celebrating. The final product is probably more telling of Chinese film censorship than of To's directorial sensibilities. But I can't help but think that there is a grittier, nuttier version of Drug War lying in the corner of Johnnie To's desk that is stamped ""rejected"", namely the version of the story that he didn't get to make.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Johnnie To's Drug War is a very well shot, and well directed film about a Chinese police operation to take down a drug operation. Timmy, a high level meth dealer, is busted after his drug factory explodes, and he crashes his car trying to escape. The police agree to waive the death penalty if he helps take down the operation he is a part of. This leads to an intricate operation from Captain Zhang and his fellow officers. The operation takes them all through the supply chain, as they try and net the organizations kingpins and bust them all.This movie was excellent. It was shot very well, showcasing the smoggy locales of big-city China. It was excellently choreographed, with the police operations especially looking professional and intricate. The action was well done, with gritty and well shot gun fights. The acting on all sides ranged from good to great, with some of the minor police officers and gangsters under performing, but some great performances from the films protagonists. Really, most of the elements of this film, from the story, to the direction, to the shots, to the action, was well done.Two small complaints on my part keep the film from a higher rating. The first is the sound direction. It never wowed me like some other elements of the film. The gun shots were hollow and underwhelming, and lacked meat. The street sounds were muted. It just felt a little weak. The second complaint I have already mentioned above. Some of the minor characters were not acted well or fleshed out, so in the final showdown, when police officers you have been seeing the entire film go down, I felt little connection to them, and sometimes even had to look back to remember why they were there in the first place! All in all, an 8 out of 10 is a solid film. It is exciting, taught, suspenseful and has excellent direction, action choreography, and is shot well. A few minor complaints aside, this is a fabulous crime drama, and worthy of your attention if you enjoy crime films, or are into Asian cinema. I certainly enjoyed it, and look forward to giving it a watch again in the future."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Is Johnnie To the best visual storyteller working in cinema today - or for that matter, during the past 20 years, plus. Is The Pope Catholic?Funnily enough, the story - as in who's doing what to whom and what eventually happens to each of them - doesn't matter, especially. Well it does, in the sense that we're interested in knowing that the police are looking to infiltrate and eventually defeat the drug syndicate that has been doing such damage to both the local Chinese populace, and their counterparts in neighbouring Asian countries; but there really would be no point in trying to track, minutely, the evolution and construction of that story. The best way - maybe the only way, in Drug War's case - to enjoy Johnnie To is to just sit back and watch the knitting together of a story through immaculately-chosen visuals, and a succession of frequently rapidly-edited images, viewed from a wide variety of perspectives. If you focus on one character and try to follow his or her story arc you will probably quickly throw up your hands in exasperation.I got the plot, and I loved the resolution, and I enjoyed the thrill- ride. I thrilled at the editing, and the choreography and recognised that this story just couldn't have been told better, if you ditched 70% of the characters, and scenes - to make it more easily-digestible. There were some great characters, action scenes, charismatic acting, and great support bits. Have I covered everything you need in a great film? Pacing: top-notch; the rapid switches of perspectives to show how the relevant characters were reacting had me drooling. Technology is used, but not abused.Masterpiece. And there was me thinking that by 2012, Johnnie To had most likely lost the plot, given his age. Not a bit of it.I've just ordered the DVD (Saturday night's viewing was a late-night TV broadcast). I can't wait!"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"First off let me say that I love asian flicks and have for some time. Decided to watch Drug Wars after seeing reviews here and elsewhere. Lemme say that I have mixed feelings about it. Convoluted script and weak characters with some exceptions. Action scenes were also a letdown. Got a little dizzy trying to keep up with all the character switches going down during the drug deals. Loved the deaf guys in the movie. And I was majorly disappointed with the ending of this movie. I mean how much imagination does it take to show a lethal injection execution? And I get it, the main character still trying to make deals by selling out every drug dealer he knows even til the very end. A mixed bag for me."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"the screenplay is way too long and way too messy, with too many abrupt twists but at the same time way too predictable. too many characters way too pretentiously acted like drug dealer haha, this kind character is nothing but a clown who's not convincingly owning 70 fishing boats, guy like him is like Eric Tsang, a short fat actor often playing underworld boss or don that was absolutely impossible for a guy in the realistic world to get on top and to become a terrifying gangster boss. so a guy like haha, a clown and A+ jerk, nor could be possible to be such fearsome rich and powerful drug dealer. it's a joke to have such character in this vicious world of drugs. the film is way too long that dragged out and dragged along in cars, trains and warehouse. the final gun battle among the good, the bad and the ugly, only showed how stupid and lame the narcotic police force is and no wonder all the main characters of the narcotic team are killed. also, never saw any narcotic cop would drive a RED sedan following a drug transporting truck from south to north so close and those two guys, even overdosed so much, would not have spotted the following vehicle behind them. the scene after the truck crashed into a pile, so many cars stopped there and the scene became so confusingly messy and clueless. there are so many scenes way too pretentious to convince a viewer like me.this is a very pretentious and flashy film, quite serious and action packed but at the same time, never allowed the viewers getting the chance to get connected deep enough."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I admit that after reading some great reviews, I went into this movie expecting big things, and that might be why I felt so led down.This is by no means a bad movie. There are some good twists here and there, accompanied by a gritty and truthful style of directing unseen it most Hollywood products. I mean in what serious Hollywood movie can you see cops pulling over to pee in the middle of the road. The acting by the two lead actors was great. Loius Koo was subtle as the villain, while Honglei Sun saved his boring role with his flexibility. I also like the way some villains were portrayed, showing them as more humane than in most other products from mainland China. But ultimately, it still doesn't live up to its potential. The cops in this movie, staying true to Chinese propaganda, are all one- dimensional heroes who are always willing to sacrificed for the greater good. There were no internal conflicts, no questions asked, not even some hesitations. They all just quietly do what they're told. In fact, most of them maintained only one facial expression throughout the movie: anger. They were mere puppets used to show the movie's story, not realistic and engaging characters. And of course, the ending with the good triumph over evil can be seen from miles away, despite the director's effort to spice it up.Considered the strict media censorship in China, this was probably the best the director could do, but it's still a waste of a nice premise. That's why I'm really looking forward to the upcoming South Korean remake."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"The plot has potential, albeit the fact that the theme (e.g. drugs with an obsessive cop, and a bit of double agent) has been way over done. The first 5 minutes immediately introduce the two main characters in this film, the obsessive cop in an undercover op. and a meth supplier (Louis Koo) crashing his car after escaping from an explosion from his meth lab. The two inevitability meets at the hospital. In exchange for freedom, Koo offers information regarding the bigger drug lords and his other manufacture operations nearby. Unfortunately, this is where the movie begins falls flat and drag on for the remainder of the movie. Characters are quickly introduced but left to fend for themselves. Eventually, the movie does drag itself to the climatic shoot out. At this point, I recommend turning it off and do something else. Because the science behind it is similar to cheesy action flicks made back in the 80's (i.e. a wooden table can stop bullets, guns have unlimited ammo, especially pistols. Perhaps, the director and/or special effects team should do a little bit of research on how guns work. No, empty oil barrels cannot stop bullets from a gun. Not even if you have two barrels. Also, the trunk of a car cannot stop bullets either.Overall, avoid. Not sure how this movie won several awards in Asia."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"There is no problem with the acting skills of the actors. It's nice to watch them play. However, as a movie, I feel that the logic of the story makes me feel uncomfortable. The villain's intelligence is severely reduced, and the final motivation is not convincing"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Normally I am not overly keen on movies that was based upon a story about drugs, as they usually tend to be stereotypical and be similar to one another. Yet, I was given the chance now in 2020 to sit down and watch the 2012 movie ""Drug War"" (aka ""Du zhan"") from Hong Kong heavyweight director Johnnie To. And of course I sat down to watch it, given my love and admiration of the Asian cinema.""Drug War"" was definitely entertaining, and it was a combination of a good and non-linear storyline, along with a good amount of action and a great cast ensemble that made the movie work out well.It was nice to see the likes of Louis Koo in such a role that deviated so much from what he usually does, and he made it work well. It was also a blast to have Suet Lam and Hoi-Pang Lo on the cast list. Now, I am not very familiar with the work of Honglei Sun, but he definitely managed to carry the lead role quite well.What I really enjoyed about the movie was how unpredictable it was, and how the movie took a massive turn of events towards the end on the scene in the middle of the road. That scene must be seen, because it can't be given the justice it deserves with written words. Nor would I want to ruin that for you.I was genuinely entertained by the story, and the movie also had a good character gallery - which were portrayed by a great cast ensemble. And the movie had a good mixture of action and drama as well.My rating of ""Drug War"" is a seven out of ten stars. This is definitely well worth the time, money and effort."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"As with the other Johnnie To films I have seen, I am left a bit torn. One part of me likes the visuals and story, but the other cannot deny that there's something missing. I have noticed a lot of To's films can be quite confusing at times. It's a mix of not enough character back-story, too many characters sometimes, and some iffy directing and editing. The storyline is quite simple in a way, and honestly a little under developed. We get launched straight into the story with a car crash, and all of the characters don't really get much development besides what is happening to them in the present moment. This leaves you a little confused on what every characters intentions are, ESPECIALLY Timmy, played by Joseph Koo. We aren't sure whether he is helping the cops, or trying to play them. Now obviously this is the point, especially towards the end, but it's even worse because we barely know his character. I would have liked to of seen a little of him before these events occur to at least get an idea of what he might be trying to do. This problem leads to an ending that is pretty unclear until it's pretty much all said and done with.Probably the best sequence is the final shootout, which could be compared to the shootout in ""Heat"", except it's not quite as tightly made. This sequence really shows of To's weaknesses in his films. Characters are all over the place, and because there are so many and we don't get to know them, we sometimes can easily mistake the side police characters for the side criminal characters. It can become quite confusing and gets in the way. We also bounce back and forth between different events in the shootout, making it confusing. Also, the choreography in regard to the shootout is weak. There's a lot of standing out in the open which police wouldn't do, and people get shot but just keep going as if they got hit by a paintball. We don't know if someone is shot and killed or just shot and injured, completely taking away from any emotional impact it could have. I will give the ending credit, because how it all turned out kind of surprised me. I didn't expect it to go down that way. The final scene may be a little anti climatic, but I guess they couldn't end it any other way.Overall I was let down. I heard good things about this, and it just kinda gave me a ""meh"" experience. Slow at times and some weak direction certainly brought the film down a lot. I know Johnnie To has a lot of fans, but I honestly don't think he's as good as they say. Clarity is what his films lack."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,This isn't a movie that is filled with insane action. This is a movie that follows a group of cops as they try to break up a drug ring with the help of a boss that they caught. the only real action is at the end of the movie the rest of the movie has some amazing performances and well written scenes. this movie is intense from start to finish with multiple characters changing sides and loyalties being tested. in the end if you want to watch this movie know that it is not an intense action movie but is still very good. still stay till the end and watch as every character comes to life. it also has some nice twists and turns to it that make this movie that is fun to watch.
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Sadly, what almost ended as a solid 7 ended up dropping to a 6 because of a really poorly done shootout scene. I really couldn't take it seriously. I had to facepalm the moment I saw that horrendously unrealistic scenario.I gave some points for Zhang (Sun) doing a great job acting as the captain of the task force and performing his part extremely well. I liked how they had him play as a con artist, pretending to be various different drug lords. He was basically my favourite character throughout the movie.At the very beginning, I was extremely bothered with the script telling Tian (Koo) to just give in to the police without even a little retaliation. This just isn't realistic at all. What kind of high profile drug dealer just gives in to the police without even trying to feign innocence? This kept bothering me throughout the movie because he continues to do it throughout, selling his colleagues out to the police in the blink of an eye without even trying to fight back.The director tried to be unique by making about every drug dealer completely different. You have some drivers who are stoned out of their minds when they shouldn't be, you have a group of dealers who are deaf, you have one who constantly laughs hysterically, and you have somebody who talks doubles. The list goes on. I mean really, is every drug lord so radically different? This wasn't very realistic. But whatever.However, that wasn't really the factor that affected the movie so much. It was the final shootout scene that was a complete failure. It not only stalled time, it had no point, didn't solve any actual problem, and was just plain stupid from start to finish.It's hard to explain my pain with this scene without explicitly spoiling it, if I haven't spoiled enough already. Hence the spoiler warning. You're plagued with infinite ammo, diehards who don't die even when they're shot many times, and those opposite the diehards who just die in a single random shot. But that's not the worst of it. The worst comes when the main antagonist essentially survives and kills everybody else.I'm not sure what people liked about the movie. There wasn't even a message to the plot. It was just your average ordinary drug case. A story has a beginning, middle, and end. This movie has the beginning and middle, but no end. This movie just ends as ""Everybody dies, the end."". Really, that seriously disappointed me.You're free to watch the movie if you wish, but from what I've seen of Louis Koo and Johnnie To within the last few years, this is once again another movie you can safely avoid the pain of watching."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"The ""Captain's"" reaction to blowing a couples line of cocaine in the hotel room and having a panic attack where he jumps into a ice bath is beyond ridiculous. Then the final scene he gets caught because the Captain cuffs himself to his leg, this is right after he was able to escape the handcuffs by breaking his own hand, you think he might try the same technique to the hand of the captain. Overall, I thought the acting was pretty shoddy, there is no sense of realism. Obviously the director has no understanding of the illegal drug industry, and is expecting the Chinese population doesn't either. There is one clear message from the film, if you take or are involved in the drug industry you will get the lethal injection. This is a Chinese propaganda film aimed at scaring people away from drug use and in that sense I guess it is successful. Not something I am really interested in watching though."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"This movie begins with a man named ""Timmy Choi"" (Louis Koo) driving erratically down the street in a frantic effort to get to a hospital. Unfortunately, he crashes prior to reaching his destination and upon being admitted is subsequently put under police guard under suspicion of operating a meth lab nearby that exploded and left several people dead. Realizing that if he is found guilty of distributing illegal drugs he could get the death penalty, he quickly pleads for the opportunity to turn state's evidence and help them apprehend several key players in the drug racket. Intrigued by this rare opportunity but extremely suspicious of Timmy, ""Captain Zhang Lei"" (Honglei Sun) reluctantly agrees. From then on the stakes become much higher as both of them wend their way through the various levels of organized crime in search of the underworld kingpins. Now without giving away any more of this movie let me just say that this turned out to be one of the better drug movies of late with an interesting plot and several suspenseful scenes which kept my interest throughout. Accordingly, I rate this movie as above average and recommend it to those who might enjoy a film of this type."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"After clearing some history on my laptop to make some space,I was shocked when I re-logged into streaming service Shudder,and found it put me on the US version of the site! Taking part in a Chinese cinema viewing challenge on ICM,I was happy to see two Johnnie To flicks not on the UK site,leading to me joining the war.View on the film:Revealed later that the original written ending was for the baddie to get away with it all, a ending that was never filmed due to suspicious the Chinese ratings board would not approve, the screenplay by Ka-Fai Wai/Nai-Hoi Yau/Ryker Chan and Xi Yu find a fittingly sly compromise, where justice gets served, but is a hollow one after the level of destruction inflicted on the cops.Untangling a major drug operation, the writers load up the frantic action with psychological thrills, as the team of detectives attempt to decode the criminals messages,whilst also heightening tension in the game of trust between Captain Zhang and informant/ drug dealer Choi.The first of his works to be shot on the Mainland, directing auteur Johnnie To reunites with cinematographer Siu-Keung Cheng, and stylishly continues to build on the recurring comedic quirks To injects his Thrillers with,via discussions on planning a drug bust being done in sign language,anxiety being cast across the faces of the cops in excellent sequences involving secret mics being under risk of getting found, and To altering the speed of the film for the final battle,in order to give the final boss a wonderfully pulpy, video game gloss.Shining a light on the Mainland underworld with blue lens flair, To & Cheng bring their eye for break-neck Action set-pieces over to the Mainland that incredibly include cops in the body count, (usually a huge no-no from China's ratings board) thanks to crispy long track shots rumbling down the roads in chases between the cops and the gangs,which turn into slick whip-pans on the hand to hand combat. Working with To for the 10th time,Louis Koo gives a gloriously all guns blazing turn as Choi, whose violent mood swings Koo uses to keep Choi on the edge, between both sides in the drug war."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"""Drug War"" is an interesting and compelling film, but it is far too long and there are far too many plot flaws to be memorable. Along with the plot flaws, there are literally dozens of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", so it can be hard to keep track of who's who, especially when the shooting starts and when you've got 3 seconds to see who bought the farm before the camera angle changes.That being said, the main characters do a good job and there are several minor characters ( a drug boss who laughs, two deaf mute low level gangsters) who give the film a certain charm. Moreover, the glance we get of law enforcement in China is certainly eye opening.Best of all is the ending, with a shootout that certainly rates in the top 10 of murder and mayhem, although falling short of such classics as ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Yojimbo"", ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""The Beast of the City."""
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,This is an excellent example of an action movie with real story and characters. Everything in this film is very intense and suspenseful. The viewer really feels the stakes of every scene as the characters are not invincible and anyone can die.
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I can appreciate the work that went into making Drug War, the action scenes are well-directed and it has a likable cast, but what it boils down to, is that it just isn't fun to watch. I was checking how long I had left of the film every 25 minute or so, and that's not a good sign. I'm not asking for mindless action and shoot-outs, I just don't think the story was exciting enough to keep me interested for the films almost 2 hour long running time.If you absolutely love thrillers from Hong Kong and don't mind a somewhat slow pace, then maybe this film will appeal to you. Director Johnnie To has made some really great films in the past, such as the Election-films and Mad Detective. 5/10"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,Non-stop very efficient fight against the mob using a drug lord that was losing it all. Original ending. The film is ass-kicking.
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"As a long-time fan of gangster movies and police dramas, I was absolutely blown away by the quality of this film.From a technical standpoint, this movie is at a zenith. The sound design is perfect - every ""click-clack"" of a pistol or lighter has a satisfying crunch. Moody cinematography with plenty of close-ups adds lots of texture. Chase scenes capture the action, and atmospheric scenes set the tone.The story is intricate, with plenty of memorable characters (even minor roles such as ""The Mute Brothers"", Ha-ha, and the methy truck drivers were able to steal scenes). The main protagonist and antagonist give stellar performances, brimming with intensity and leaving the audience guessing.Easily a 10/10, one of my favorite crime movies of all time after my first viewing. This has me wanting to look into more Asian cinema - I am clearly missing quite a few gems."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"At first I thought it was going to be your typical action flick that has a poor plot and has a poor script that you just watch simply for the action, but I was wrong. This film kept me thinking and involved from start to finish. It's a bit longer, but certainly doesn't drag and drag. It's full of twists and is honestly the first action film I've seen in awhile that I couldn't predict the outcome correctly. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Even if you aren't fond of subtitles, it is still definitely worth the watch."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Many crime films focus either on the action or the characters. Drug War tries to do both. Unfortunately, the film that results is less than the sum of its parts.What the film does do well is show a grittier dark side of Chinese society. Shooting in Tianjin, China, lends a bit of authenticity.Unfortunately, this movie suffers from an uneven pace and unclear story line. Aside from Louis Koo and Honglei Sun, most of the acting is forgettable. Of note, I found the Bill Li group especially implausible. The Mute Gang seemed more cutthroat and impressive as a drug gang that the masterminds.I felt the ending was too drawn out, illogical, and unfortunately, comedic. Gunshots apparently don't kill. Chinese police apparently don't use tactics when apprehending armed criminals, except at the very end."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Hong Kong DEA are cracking down on the shipments of powder through their city . Luckily they get their hands on one of the major pushers , and after threatening him with the death penalty he decides to help the cops to save his own neck ."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"What else can i give a movie that held my attention from the beginning to the end? It was intelligently made. My only question, is crystal meth running that rampant in foreign countries? Even in 2020?"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Acting was solid mostly. Story was too predicable. Basically a really terrible imitation of a throw-away American 70s gansta movie without all the fun and humor. The message is, drugs are bad and drug dealers gets justice. Don't do drugs.The thing is, the movie can propaganda this message and also makes it fun (see Lethal Weapon series for great examples). This is way too serious and at least show cops hold their weapons correctly (see End of Watch). Wasted my time."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Just one thing at the end action scene is too low level b garade,,,hope indian make the remake of this movie"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I really enjoyed watching this movie on many levels. Hong Lei as the captain was superb, Louis Koo was great, Michele Ye was a bit of a wind up toy throughout the movie; one tempo and no emotion. Overall the acting was good. Strangely, I was determined to enjoy the movie as an homage to many other great movies. Louis played a pretty good Verbal/Keyser. Uncle Li was our Kobayashi. The ""mute"" shoot out was my favorite part, giving Boondock Saints a run for their money. The climactic shootout was all too ""Heat"" for me. Another level on which I enjoyed the film is as an observer of Chinese and Hong Kong cinema over the years. The seemingly requisite task of towing the PRC line: Chinese police are clever, true blue and have the dedication of a Samurai. Capitalists/Titans of Industry are ruthless, frivolous, and bourgeois. Powerful drug dealers, can be anyone!! Your funny uncle, your fancy aunt, etc. And drugs are very bad. Not only will drugs probably kill you, but they won't even get you high. Really, it is an amalgamation of all drugs, causing simultaneous alertness and despondence, hypnotic sedation, tachycardia and hallucination, finishing with a lovely sense of bugs crawling all over your skin. Truly a wonder drug, it's no wonder why it is in such high demand. Lastly, I loved the Buicks, particularly when in 'Sport Mode""."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"Drug War movies are just modern Gladiator Shows for American Drug Warriors. Producers of such films exploit the violence created by the absurd Drug War for personal gain. Americans, used to urinating for employment, fail to realize that the Drug War is simply the enforcement of Christian Science Sharia -- Christian Science: the religion that says we have a moral obligation to renounce the medicines of Mother Nature. The Drug War is corrupt. No other society has ever scapegoated substances like this to turn ordinary people into criminals. Producers should stop exploiting it. And movie reviewers should stop treating these movies as if the Drug War that prompted the action was somehow moral and common sense. Thomas Jefferson didn't think so -- and he was rolling in his grave when the DEA confiscated his poppy plants, the same DEA that has been lying about psychoactive plant medicine for the last 50 years. Enough drug war propaganda movies, already."
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I really enjoyed the movie,it started well and the story line was nice but the shooting effects was bad,too bad if a director like Roland or Danny Boyle has taken it,it would have being awesomely great,but i also got a problem,i didn't like the way Timmy died. He tried surviving till the very end only for him to survive he still died,and that was very annoying and how did that cop at the end of the movie cuff his legs,that was the most annoying part for me,to very annoying but it was a great storyline but poor shooting effects. I really love Asian movies its certainly the best if not its very entertaining so very much. if you think am wrong tweet me @iamowomizz"
毒战,Drug War (2012),,2012,2013.4.2,"I've seen this film about 20 times and for some reason, I've never got to write down all of my thoughts on paper. Drug War is my favourite crime thriller film of all time. No one's ever going to change my mind. Not even ""Seven"", ""Heat"", ""The Prestige"" or ""Scarface"" would convince me to change otherwise. Unpopular opinion: this might be in my top 25 favourite films of all time! Drug War is just a very personal film to me and the way it was shot, staged and cut...I just felt like I've watched a completely different film that somewhat stands out from any other average crime thrillers I've experienced in my lifetime. For me, the first-ever viewing was a surprise but the second time I saw it, it was a total out-of-body experience.Apart from that, there are also two reasons why Drug War doesn't get the worldwide recognition it may deserve for it to be considered as a classic HK film (Chinese film but still, whatever). Firstly, western audiences seem to be jumping on certain bandwagons when it comes to crime/action films made in Hong Kong such as ""Infernal Affairs"" starring Tony Leung Chiu-Wai & Andy Lau. Or John Woo's guns-a-blazin flicks like ""A Better Tomorrow"" or ""Hard Boiled. And maybe even Johnnie's most known crime thrillers such as ""Election"" or ""PTU"". And yes, I can understand that Drug War seems to be more recent than those films in comparison but also, this film is set in mainland China instead of Hong Kong (CCP restrictions and all that). Secondly, if you're looking for a crime film where it focuses on in-depth character development or psychological emotions; or a crime film where it has explosions, gunfights every 10 minutes or the usual action film clichés, you'll be disappointed. I believe this film is well better off without those and the film is still intelligent and exhilarating overall.A simple synopsis; a Hong Kong criminal gets arrested for manufacturing tons of meth in China and is ceased to receive a death sentence. However, the criminal begs to keep him alive and allow him to help the police take down the drug ring. The Chinese police captain, looking unconvinced, gives him one chance to redeem himself and the criminal turns into an informant to work alongside the police. Or does he? With a partnership being formed between a cop and a criminal through circumstances, one can't help but realise that the criminal is a tad suspicious. What are his exact motivations in this film? Also, throughout the entire film, who really has the upper hand here; the cop (stoic & no-nonsense) or the criminal (looks vulnerable on the outside, sneaky & cunning on the inside)?Like mentioned, we never get to see the full backstory of these two primary characters; Johnnie To (like many of his other films) tends to tell his stories this way and delves straight to the point; focus on the police operation at hand. Simple plot but with such reckless filmmaking from Johnnie and strong & slick storytelling on display.The direction is detailed and low-key. It's procedural, intense and nonetheless, edge-of-your-seat material. As mentioned, there is not really any key action set-pieces throughout the first 2/3 of the film as all the events have unfolded over 72 sleepless hours of the intense insight of the operation that is complex and full of surprises (that's all you get to know). Then it all leads to what's arguably the greatest final 20 minutes of a crime film I have seen in my life, appropriate for every language on this planet. It's confronting and 'in your face' at the same time.In my heart, Drug War (even the lead up to the finale itself) should place themselves alongside other American crime masterpieces that I have seen. The camera movement was utilised so elegantly, even while the chaos is taking place in the frame. Usually many other crime films make the shots ""shaky"" in order to capture the excitement of the chaos which I believe loses the authenticity, something that Drug War doesn't lack. The overall colour grading is cold-blooded, silver-blue fog which is like the old French New Wave crime films from master filmmaker Jean Pierre-Melville (Johnnie's filmmaking inspiration) and I think it was used nicely because it definitely gave me the chills watching this. The visuals are so sophisticated, and the action set-pieces are purely old-school craftmanship, something that new HK/Chinese thrillers mostly lack these days (if you've seen them, you should know what I meant).It's gripping and enthralling from start to finish! If you are not familiar with Johnnie To, Drug War is a great film to be introduced to his filmmaking style. I highly HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend giving this movie a watch. What I LOVE about this film is how simple the plot is and how it results into one of the most terrifying climatic resolutions I have ever witnessed."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"In China, in the early 70s, Lu Yanshi (Daoming Chen), a political prisoner, is released at the end of the Cultural Revolution. When he returns home, he discovers that his wife Feng Wanyu (Gong Li) is suffering from amnesia: she waits every day for the return of her husband, without understanding that he is at her side.I loved the infinite tenderness that emerges from this film. The rhythm of the film is intentionally slow and we feel a real chemistry between the three main actors (father, mother and daughter). The director Yimou Zhang immerses us in a beautiful love story with the poignant beauty and intense presence of the actress Gong Li, with the extraordinary talent of the actor Daoming Chen who plays soberly in the shadow of his wife, with a neat, delicate and graceful photography.As a synthesis: behind a slight facade of political pamphlet, a delightful ode of lyricism. 8/9 of 10"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"""Coming Home"" (2014 release from China; 110 min.) brings the story of Lu, a ""rightist bastard"" during the Cultural Revolution. As the movie opens, we see a woman (Feng) and her daughter (Dandan) being called into the Propaganda Office of the girl's school, where they learn that Lu (the husband and father, respectively) has escaped from labor camp, and that they are not to see him. Feng and Lu nevertheless decide to meet up at the train station, where Lu gets captured again. We are then told ""Three years later, the Cultural Revolution ends"", and Lu arrives back home. Much to his shock, Feng does not recognize him. What caused Feng's amnesia? Will she ultimately recognize him? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Zhang Yimou (best known here for ""House of the Flying Daggers""), Here he tackles a potentially sensitive topic in China, namely the horrible Cultural Revolution. But don't think that this is a political movie. Instead, it is a love story that happens to be set during and after the Cultural Revolution. Feng is played by the leading Chinese actress Gong Li (think of her as the Meryl Streep of China), and plays the role with restraint and visible hurt. Special mention also for the beautiful Zhang Huiwen in the role of Dandan (check out the ballet performances!). Last but not least, I couldn't help but notice that the piano you hear in the orchestral score is played by none other than Lang Lang. Bottom line: ""Coming Home"" is a slow-moving (in the best possible way) movie that examines the long shadows of the Cultural Revolution through the eyes of one particular couple.This movie is now a year and a half, yet it recently showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Better late than never I suppose. The weekday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly. A shame. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare, you may want to give this a try. ""Coming Home"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"By 'simple pleasures', I don't mean that in any way to reference the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but his return to simple films, about simple people, beautifully crafted, acted, and very revealing about everyday Chinese life (as much as he is able).Zhang Yimou (Chinese names put the surname first, IMDb doesn't, alas) is arguably one of the best directors of the 20th and early 21st centuries (best known in the West for House of Flying Daggers). He always evokes a magical feeling in me, and I love his technique and precision; almost every frame is a painting. He chose to remain in mainland China and has walked a very thin tightrope in making the kinds of films he has, as he does not shy away from the political situation in China, at least as part of everyday people's lives, which it is, of course. His films are just not primarily about Chinese politics (although his simple, but great early film, The Story of Qiu Ju, is about Chinese bureaucracy, and was indeed banned for a time. The fact that Gong Li, in this film, screams to the prison officials that have come to capture her husband, ""What did you do to him to make him want to escape?"", turning the blame for his prison escape back onto them, illustrates what their intl fame allows them to get away with.Gong Li, Zhang Yimou's ex-wife, is, I believe, the premiere female actress in China (and now known worldwide, since the wonderful film, Raise the Red Lantern, was nominated for an Oscar in 1990), with good reason, and an actress of incredible breadth and depth. Even though she has been on many 'most beautiful people' lists, (she is very made up here (or down!)), her craft is everything and I cannot watch her enough. She is lately known here for Memoirs of a Geisha, as the evil Hatsumomo.I was very, very glad to see Zhang Yimou and Gong Li reunite, professionally, for 2 recent films. They seem to push each other upward and she makes a perfect muse for him.Ah, the film...(I love telling people about them!). Coming Home is about a couple dealing with and trying to reunite after Gong Li's husband is imprisoned for a couple of decades during the Cultural Revolution in China. She grows progressively ill, which adds to their difficulties, thus the meat of the movie is about their reuniting difficulties. Definitely without a stock Hollywood ending! I was struck by one very incredible scene... It is just a walk across the kitchen by Gong Li, when her husband is knocking at her door. She has been warned severely by the police. This walk seems to take several hours as she haltingly walks across the floor, with all the ramifications, both political and personal, flashing across her face and obviously in her mind. It is one of the most astonishing 20 seconds of film I think I have ever seen, and done without dialog, melodrama or Hollywood artifice.Zhang Yimou has crafted a fine film here. It is slow, but in a good way, which builds a lot of emotional suspense. Someone said it only covers the last 20-30 pages of the book upon which it is based. As usual, every aspect of the film is top notch and it walks on the edge of the dramatic sword in a perfectly balanced manner. It will go down as another of my favorite Zhang Yimou movies. Be patient, although the tension he creates will keep you pinned, if not a bit frustrated, but that is also the beauty of it, and enjoy! And check out some of his other films!"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"This is a poignant, very sad yet beautiful little movie. Powerful drama with amazing acting and direction. A difficult watch and yet captivating. You keep waiting for the happy end which, in a way, does arrive.Zhang's handling of this extremely unpleasant period in China's chequered history is masterful. It really is striking to look back on this and reflect on the China of today. Unbelievable transition. Yet I feel the simple nobility and strength of the family unit portrayed in this movie, endures.Very special little movie."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Coming Home is a great example of the way in which a movie can move you, play on your emotions, without being sentimental in a negative sense. Without being a tear-jerker. And without harsh images of struggle and war. But with excellent acting, small gestures and not so much words. This movie is all about empathy, first among the characters in the story depicted, but by consequence also among the audience, that is swept away and taken in by the sentiment.This doesn't mean that the story is only about love and compassion. The Cultural Revolution in China (1966-1976) was far from being peaceful and compassionate. People were separated for years without any information, were forced to report any 'wrong' behavior that could 'harm' or 'threaten' the Communist Party. Coming Home shows how such an environment affects people at the individual, family level. People get damaged and family relations are shattered because of betrayal.Coming Home succeeds in portraying the consequences of such a regime, by showing what humanity and compassion mean. And that is what makes it special, and refreshing in a world where it sometimes feels like these values are hard to find."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Sometimes a movie comes along that requires your patience, but is worth every minute of your time. ""Coming Home"" (PG-13, 1:49) is one of those movies. It's a Chinese film, which, for most of us, means subtitles, but this film is from Yimou Zhang, the director of ""Hero"" and ""House of the Flying Daggers"", and stars Gong Li (also known as Li Gong), who starred in ""House of the Flying Daggers"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", as well as ""Hannibal Rising"" and ""Miami Vice"". This film's pace is slow, but an open-minded audience member's reward will be a dramatic and heart-breaking romance that you won't soon forget.The setting is China, during Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong's ""Cultural Revolution"". Starting in 1966, and only really ending with Mao's death in 1976, this was a nationwide effort to purge remnants of capitalism and even Chinese culture which ran contrary to Chairman Mao's personal interpretation of communism. Party officials and local police publicly humiliated and harassed people, seized property, relocated many Chinese citizens, tortured some and arbitrarily imprisoned others. One of those was a college professor named Lu Yanshi (Daoming Chen), whose time in Chinese labor camps kept him away from his wife, Feng Wanyu (Gong Li) and young daughter Dandan (Huiwen Zhang) for a total of 20 years.As the film opens, Feng and her teenage daughter are summoned to the office of a party official who informs them that Lu has escaped from prison. The official sternly reminds them that failure to report any contact with Lu is a crime. The thoroughly indoctrinated Dandan responds obediently by spouting a line of communist propaganda. Feng merely responds that she understands. Lu does try to rejoin his family, resulting in some of the most tense and best-acted scenes I've ever watched on the big screen.It is only after the Cultural Revolution ends that Lu can return home safely. By that time, Feng is suffering from a type of amnesia that requires her to refer to notes so she can accomplish ordinary daily tasks and, tragically, also renders her unable to recognize her husband. She remembers Feng as a young man, but when she finally sees him face to face, she mistakes him for a party official whom she hates and she kicks him out of the house. No one, can convince her that the man she has turned away really is Lu – not the local communist party officials and not even Feng's own daughter who has grown up to regret the ways she had denied or been disloyal to her father. Neither the audience, nor Lu himself knows whether, the next time Feng sees him, she'll mistake him for an old enemy, think that he is a piano tuner or a friendly neighbor, or even acknowledge him at all.Lu takes up residence in an abandoned store across the street and his daughter, now living on her own, establishes a relationship with Lu and works with him to try overcoming her mother's amnesia. Feng receives a long-delayed letter from Lu telling her that he's coming home ""on the 5th of the month"". She readies the house in anticipation, even as she sees Lu around the neighborhood on a regular basis, but never recognizes him. Lu and Dandan talk to Feng's doctor and try various strategies, direct and indirect, hoping to get Feng to remember her heart-broken husband. Meanwhile, on the 5th of every month, Feng journeys to the train station and holds a hand-made sign with her husband's name on it until the last of the passengers have descended the long, stone staircase and the workers close the large, metal gates.""Coming Home"" is a combination of the 1965 classic romance ""Doctor Zhivago"" and the more modern romance in 2004's ""The Notebook"", but with a distinct Chinese sensibility. The setting, however, is merely background. This film has the potential to deeply affect people regardless of age or nationality. The acting is truly outstanding, especially from Gong Li who lives completely in every moment of this film, acts with every cell of her body and gives a performance for the ages. This film is so well written, directed, acted and edited that it requires no understanding of the Chinese language and no knowledge of Chinese history or culture to enjoy and appreciate this timeless tale of love, loss and redemption. It may sound trite, but the language of love truly is universal. That, and the other emotions and relationships that are part of this story require nothing more than a human heart to understand. I'd rather that this film had incorporated a little more variation in tone and pacing, but there is no denying this film's power to use the emotions of its characters to touch the emotions of its audience.

回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"This is a very interesting idea for a film and actually criticizes, indirectly, recent Chinese history. Both made me excited to see the film...yet, sadly, I found the film incredibly flat....well acted but flat and lifeless.The film begins during the so-called 'Cultural Revolution' in mainland China. It was a period in Communist Chinese history when Mao set off a period where supposed remnants of decadence and capitalism were purged. What actually happened is that intellectuals, professors and others were violently beaten, killed or imprisoned by student groups. Nothing much came of this movement (my opinion, of course, but one supported by most historians) and it mostly just made a lot of folks miserable. During this time, Lu is arrested for his decadence though exactly what he supposedly did is never mentioned in the film. Instead, he simply disappears and he finally returns home many, many years later. However, he's shocked to see that his wife's mind has snapped and Feng no longer recognizes him...and even calls out for help when he enters the home! All the while she keeps insisting throughout the film that 'Yu will be coming home on the 5th'...though in her mind the 5th never arrives.So the setup for this is very interesting as is Yu's attempt to get his wife to recognize him. However, ultimately the film goes no where and is just depressing and tedious. The pacing is THE problem with the film, though the downbeat ending didn't help. Too bad, as the concept and the acting are quite good."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I'm was born in early 90s in China. As I grow up, my parents always consciously saving up everything. They do not waste anything, food, clothes, etc..My mom is good at stitching clothes. Even thou she can afford buying a new pair of socks, she chose to stitch up the worn ones. I thought I'd never understand why my parents are so thrifty, until I watched this movie.I came to realize what a hard, tough and poor life my parents had went thru after watching this movie. I was even surprised that my parents could actually survived that period of time.I realized that people don't need that much of things to survive. When my friend and I shopping in mall, talking about cosmetics and luxury bags, and living a wealthy and ""fancy"" life, while my mother when she was in my age, struggling to live, wearing the same clothes everyday, celebrating her birthday by only eating an egg, running after trains in order to pick up the ""coal ball"" (trains in old time use coal as the fuel and the coal ball is the coal which was not fully burned, and could still being used for generating a little heat).This is a great movie to honor that harsh period of time in China's history. And I'm also glad to see that Chinese government now allows people to talk about that period of time and even make a movie about it."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I had high expectation for Zhang Yimou's latest film Coming Home, because he finally went back to tell a simple and plain story. So when I heard there was an advanced screening on May 11, I immediately went to see it. However, after watching this 111-minute movie, I was disappointed. To be precisely, I had mixed feeling about the film, I think it is Zhang's best film since House of Flying Daggers, however it is still not a good film. The story is simple, the cinematography is simple, everything is simple in this film, just like what Zhang promised. He intended to make everything simple, trying so hard to drop his color- using style and maintain simple. However, such simpleness is intended, it is not natural. For simple life story movies (Yi Yi, Platform, The World, A Simple Life), the key to be a great movie is if it could give audience a special feeling and a deep theme through its simpleness. And such thing behind its simpleness is the soul of the movie. However, Coming Home didn't achieve that, I can barely feel anything behind its intended simpleness and schmaltz. Its soul is empty. Still, I have to admit, there are some good sides of the film, especially Gong Li and Chen Daoming's amazing acting. Their performances are superb, one of the best performances I've seen in recent years. Also, I love the well-crafted first 10-minute and the sentimental ending. All in all, I appreciated Zhang's trying of going back to the simple and I wish he could continue that. Coming Home may not be a fantastic film but it is still a well-crafted movie with some touching moments. My score: 7.1 (PS: To understand the film ,be sure to learn some background information and the history about the Cultural Revolution. Due to the censorship in China, Zhang can't tell something about the story too obvious, so if you know nothing about that history, you will be confused by something happens in the film.)"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"What is a home ? Is it just four walls under a roof that provide shelter to a family ? Or.. Is it the sense of belonging that every member of a family holds toward each other and to the family as a whole ..? Indeed, it is the confluence of souls that find solace and succour in one another, especially when they wade through turbid tides of troubled times. Noted director Zhang Yimou's Coming Home explores this theme in a family drama set in the tumultuous era of Chinese cultural revolution (1966-76).It recounts the story of a small Chinese family of Professor Lu Yanshi (Chen Daoming), his wife Feng Wan Yu (Gong Li) and their daughter - Dandan (Hang Huiwen). Early in the movie, at the height of cultural revolution, we find this family is thrown into disarray when Professor Lu is forcibly separated from his wife and infant daughter on being accused of anti-national activities. He is one among the millions who are incarcerated and relegated to a labour camp for a long sentence. Several years pass by as we see that, under the watchful glare of the state which is wary of Lu's status of an anti-national, Feng is struggling to make ends meet as a teacher even as Dandan, a student at the ballet academy, is struggling in her own way to land a part of lead in a prestigious stage show. When Lu makes a desperate attempt to flee his captors and reunite with his family, Feng is having a difficult dilemma between rejoicing his escape, being wary of Dandan who barely remembers him and sees him merely as the source of their miserable status and the state which puts them under a microscope to recapture him if he contacts them. Ultimately, when he does return home, he is quickly pounced upon by the state authorities who were tipped off by Dandan on the hope that such loyalty would help her secure that coveted part in the show. Fate plays a cruel trick as soon after the arrest, Dandan is spurned for that role as she is still seen as the daughter of an outlaw and her mother shuts her out for what she sees an unforgivable betrayal. Some years later, when Lu is released after the Cultural Revolution, he returns to find his family shattered as his wife is suffering from an amnesia and his daughter is forced to eke out a living as a textile worker. Feng is unable to recognise Lu as her husband and she continues to wait for him to return from incarceration. The rest of the movie narrates the attempts of Yu to rebuild his family and reconnect to his wife.Yimou's narrative is subtle, yet profound in observations. It is indeed a travesty when you require an official letter to recognise somebody who is your own. And, at times, even that is not proof enough. Feng's loss of memory is perhaps, her pathetic, final attempt to shut out a State that seeks to seep down and intrude into every element of her existence to enforce a compliance to its prescribed code of conduct.Through the prism of this family, the director showcases how an authoritarian state can appropriate one's life so ruthlessly that the citizens remain helpless and mute spectator as their life and family get trampled over by the giant wheels of a State machinery which pulls its entire citizenry in a particular direction to a predetermined destination. The instruments of the state intrude into every sphere of their life to suffocate them off any meaningful independence in exercise of their choices and where the individuals and their every aspiration is subordinated to the professed Party line and jingoistic nationalism.The movie is anchored by stellar performances from the three leads - a spellbinding Gong Li and equally spectacular performances by Chen & Zhang who portray the multiple nuances of their roles effectively. Yimou's movie is ultimately a tale of triumph of the human spirit and the endless love it is capable of as well as the phenomenal power of such love to emancipate, enliven, energize and create beauty from bleakest of circumstances.The poignant, multi-layered movie replete with metaphors which premiered in Cannes in 2014 has won several accolades at several film festivals across the world."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Spielberg ""cried for an hour"" did not lie. I felt like I had been stabbed and watched, and I felt like I was dehydrated when I left the cinema. The Chinese love, which is not fast-paced, is surrounded by the times and shows two sides."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The subject of this movie is noble. It's about a woman whose husband is incarcerated for many years in China's version of the Gulag. She suffers brain damage at the hand of Chinese police thugs and is unable to recognize her husband when he does return. This should have been a good movie on an interesting subject. It wasn't. It faded after the first hour – and that's being generous. Here's what went wrong – It becomes repetitive – we are taken to the train station over and over as the woman awaits her husband. He is with her when this is done. He tries various mechanisms to achieve recognition. This is done over and over again – we got the message after the first couple of tries. It becomes a very boring version of the old Bill Murray ""Ground Hog Day"".Speaking of the word ""boring"" the film becomes this. It has no energy whatsoever. There is absolutely no humour at all – two solid excruciating hours of grimness and glumness. The story becomes claustrophobic. In the same room, with the same people having the same conversations, trying so desperately to make this woman remember the past. Too much of the same old thing."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Zhang yimou done it again. And Gong Li is more than ever - one of her best roles...i'm always hoping that she does more movies. And when Yimou and Gong Li work together it always comes an amazing movie. I wish they could go on professionaly together.""Coming Home"": It is a simple story, yet with powerful meanings. Everything is beautiful: the performances, the direction, the photography, the music... And that piano scene... Achingly. Every yimou's movies has such sensibility. He really knows how to touch.Thank you Gong Li and Zhang Yimou.An applause too for the male actor and the girl who played the daughter - hope she will get a great career."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"In more ways than the literal, Coming Home represents a homecoming of sorts for acclaimed director Zhang Yimou and Gong Li, one of his most constant and effective muses. In recent years, he has dabbled with martial arts epics and she has gone to Hollywood and back. Coming Home – on the surface a small, intimate drama, but really a film with loftier ambitions – feels more like the spiritual cousin of the work that first brought them to the attention of cineastes all over the world.Gong Li plays Wanyu, the devoted wife of Yanshi (Chen Daoming), an intellectual sent to prison during China's Cultural Revolution. Their daughter Dandan (Zhang Huiwen) grows up resentful of a man whose effective outlaw status has adversely affected their standing in the schoolroom and in society. When his long imprisonment finally ends, Yanshi returns to his family – only to find that Wanyu no longer recognises him.There's a lot to appreciate in Zhang's bittersweet (emphasis: bitter) film. The tragedy of this love story plays out in beautifully devastating images: Wanyu waiting with a painstakingly hand-made sign at the train station for a man she won't recognise anyway; Yanshi sitting with a chestful of letters, each filled with cramped, light-starved words pledging love for a family he might never see again. There's an unmistakable undercurrent of political darkness here, too: the Cultural Revolution has, quite literally, robbed Yanshi of his identity, and returned him to his wife a stranger.The trouble with Coming Home is that, even with all of its politics and metaphors, the film is really little more than an extremely well-played melodrama. Wanyu's ailment is the kind that looms large in soap operas and, while it's handled by Zhang with considerable class and dignity, it still feels faintly heavy-handed and – at times – a bit ridiculous.Much of this melodramatic tedium is alleviated by Zhang's superlative cast. Gong, stripped of make-up and bravely showing her age, slips into Wanyu's broken soul with plenty of grace – which helps keep her predicament more interesting than it really is. Chen plays the stoic Yanshi with great sensitivity, no easy feat when the character is forced to confront his heartbreak at the beloved wife he has lost every single day. Newcomer Zhang Huiwen fares well, too, in the tricky role of the flighty, difficult daughter whose teenage tantrums have sadly woven their way into the faultlines threaded through this family.With Coming Home, Zhang has crafted something very odd: a soap opera that aspires to say something a little more. It's why the film can feel so powerful and so frustrating, often at the same time. When placed in the larger context of an oppressive China, the film and its sad, broken romantic centrepiece make a lot more sense. On its own terms, however, the love story at the heart of Coming Home is only barely-disguised melodrama – and thus, more likely to frustrate than engage."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's been 20 years since Zhang's TO LIVE was banned in China, the director and female lead prohibited from speaking about it and were forbidden from working for 2 years. And it's been 15 years since Zhang withdrew his films from Cannes in the aftermath of the continuing debate as to whether his films are pro or anti government.I can't think of another director whose work is subject to as much scrutiny regarding their political leanings.If you are looking for an overt criticism of the Cultural Revolution, then this film won't satisfy. What we have is a simple story, less obvious and more oblique, but still emotional and powerfully moving.It's a tender story of a man trying to reconnect with his amnesiac wife and estranged daughter through a series of small but heart-felt gestures.The thought that struck me during the final scene, watching an elderly couple - Feng Wanyu and Lu Yanshi, waiting for the husband to come home, was that not only might he never come back, but the 20 years that kept them apart would NEVER come back. And that's a pretty strong indictment of a troubling period in China's history."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Zhang Yimou's Coming Home is a thought-provoking, slow-paced and emotionally moving drama that tells the tragic story of a family torn apart by the Cultural Revolution. The movie is surprisingly critical of China's past, takes its time to introduce the three profound main characters and offers a harrowing tale of family, love and loyalty.The film revolves around professor, husband and father Lu who gets sent to a labour camp in Northwest China. Many years later, he escapes from the labour camp and attempts to visit his wife and daughter. While his wife is enthusiastic to see him again, the daughter has been heavily indoctrinated by the Communist Party and believes her father is responsible for the family's difficult situation. When she meets her father briefly, she reveals the information to the police and hopes to get the lead role in a ballet in return. Her father gets arrested the next day, her mother breaks down in tears and the daughter still doesn't get the lead role. Three years later, the Cultural Revolution has come to an end and Lu finally comes home. He is welcomed by his cold and distant daughter Dandan and is shocked when he realizes that his wife Yu doesn't remember him anymore. He learns that she is suffering from amnesia and tries to reawaken her memory through déjà vu by showing her pictures of their past, reading her the letters he wrote her and playing music they have listened to together. Even though his wife still does't recognize him, Lu doesn't give up on her and prefers to spend his life being a stranger to his wife instead of trying his luck elsewhere.The movie convinces with stunning acting performances. Chen Daoming incarnates the faithful, intellectual and patient professor perfectly. Gong Li is stunningly realistic as confused, fragile and longing teacher. Zhang Huiwen delivers the goods as desperate, haunted and manipulated daughter. Based upon the novel The Criminal Lu Yanshi by Geling Yan, the script convinces with its critical realism. This is supported by honest settings that portray the poverty and simplicity of life in urban China throughout the seventies.Potential viewers must be prepared to watch a slow-paced movie without any surprising plot twists, side stories or vivid outbursts.If you appreciate realistic dramas, this movie will grow on you and might move you by the end as you will get attached to the three tragic characters. In Canada, many members of the First Nations have testified being unable to express genuine love to their children because they have been abused in their own childhoods in residential schools. This tendency transcends through generations and is still an ongoing problem even decades after the end of this silent genocide. In a certain way, something similar can be said about certain people from China who have been indoctrinated in a way that they are unable to love their own family or to get engaged in a passionate relationship until today. A movie like Coming Home helps this long and difficult healing process and shows that family, love and loyalty are more important than educational, material and political matters."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Yimou Zhang is one of the most famous and prolific Chinese directors. Some of his films, historical blockbusters based on traditional legends and stories, sprinkled with spectacular martial arts scenes, have gained international fame and circulation. It is possible that they finance and allow the making of his other films, those that deal with today's China or the troubled and controversial history of his country in the last century. The 2014 production 'Coming Home' belongs to this later category. It is a family drama that follows the fate of a Chinese family during the haunting decade of the Cultural Revolution and the years that followed. The year the film was made is also significant - 'Coming Home' could not have been made or would have looked differently a decade or two before 2014, and it would look differently or not be made today. The title of the film refers to the return from exile of a Chinese intellectual convicted of an unspecified guilt, who reunites with his family after almost two decades of separation. 'Coming Home' brings to screen a novel by a Chinese writer based in the United States, Geling Yan. It is an original approach to a topic present in the films and literature of the world, especially from other communist or former communist countries - the first example that comes to my mind os the one of the novel 'Panta rhei' by the Russian writer Vasili Grossman.The film opens with a long prologue, which takes place during the period of maximum terror and repression. Political prisoner Lu Yanshi (played by Daoming Chen) escapes from the 're-education' camp where he was exiled and tries to see his wife, Feng Wanyu (played by Gong Li), and daughter Dan Dan (Huiwen Zhang) who was only three years old when he was arrested. The woman and her daughter are warned by the authorities not to receive him and to report on him as soon as he appears. In a heartbreaking scene, Feng Wanyu refuses to let him into the apartment. He is denounced by the teenage girl, educated in 'patriotic' spirit, who hopes that in this way her career as a dancer in 'revolutionary' ballets will not be barred. A few years later, the period of terror ends and the released prisoners return home. Feng Wanyu, who had suffered a shock and became amnesic in the aftermath of her husband's re-arrest, no longer recognizes him. Dan Dan, whose dreams of becoming a dancer had been shattered by being the 'traitor's daughter' and despite denouncing her father, together with Lu Yanshi will try to awaken the woman's suppressed memory to return the family life to normal.The story focuses on the family cell and viewers can decide whether what they see on the screen can be generalized to the historical context in which the story takes place or even beyond. Is it possible to return to normalcy after long periods of separation and the traumatic experiences of those deported or imprisoned and of those left at home? Is Feng Wanyu's amnesia a coincidence or a symbol of a society trying to forget the dark episodes of its history? Each spectator will draw her or his own conclusions and lessons. But all, I believe will admire the acting. Gong Li and Daoming Chen are formidable actors who play with sensitivity and dignity the drama of a couple hit by the storms of history. The cinematography, combined with the authenticity of the sets and costumes, transports us to that period in history, unknown to those who did not live in a communist country. At one point I had the impression that the film is black and white, but the sensation was due to the almost mono-chromatic monotony of life, the simplicity of clothes, the decay of standard homes of the time. In the simple and impoverished interiors we witness the intrusion of the authorities into private life, the constant surveillance to which the common people were subjected. The scenes in the train station are memorable. The soundtrack is enriched by the music played by the wonderful pianist Lang Lang. The last part of the story and the conclusion of 'Coming Home' may seem melodramatic, but here too there is room for reflection. The characters do not revolt and take individual responsibility in front of the others for their share of the blame for what happened. Forgetting and forgiving each other is the key to their survival."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"A beautiful movie, ""Coming Home"" tells the story of a Chinese family broken apart because the Cultural Revolution and politics, a family that will try to still be a family through really difficult times. Shot with simplicity and a clear focus by Yimou Zhang, the movie comes alive thanks to the amazing performances of the three principal characters, played by Li Gong, Daoming Chen and Huiwen Zhang. It is Li Gong, though, who stands head and shoulders above everything around her, with a performance that will most the viewer's eyes and so alive that it will remain with them long after the credits roll.The story, as said above, centers around a Chinese family. The father, Lu Yanshi, is imprisoned by the system during the Cultural Revolution. Feng Wanyu, his wife and Dan Dan, the daughter, stay back home, trying to survive the difficult times, especially as their lives have been marked by their relationship to Lu Yanshi. When Lu Yanshi gets released, he finds a family very different from the one he left.And here is where Go Ling comes to shine. Her character, Feng Wanyu, lives too much trough her husband (one of those abnegated characters that seem to be born to serve and worry about others), but Go Ling just inhabits the character with so much mastery that you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen. Every gesture, sentence, look, every movement of the hand is a piece of work, the creation of a memorable character.This is a movie that lives and dies through its performances. Luckily for us, they save us from a movie that could have been pure cheese and delivers us a vibrant look to life, privilege and loss."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"During the Chinese Cultural Revolution Lu is incarcerated far from his wife Yu and daughter Dandan. He escapes briefly to find the former is frightened but devoted, the latter hostile to him.At the end of the Cultural Revolution Lu is rehabilitated and sent home, only to find that his wife is suffering from a catastrophic condition that means she cannot remember him. The film centres on Lu and his now reconciled daughter's efforts to restore her memory and their family life. Slow-paced, beautifully shot and bittersweet, the story is unravelled and revealed in a thoughtful and moving manner."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"Some of the dialog at the very beginning not quite correct and right during the Chinese Culture Revolution. The Chinese people in that darkest ten years torment, many jargon would not be said like what we heard in this movie. If the protagonist is a ""Spy"" as his daughter called him, he would already have been shot instead of banished to a far away poor farm as a labor. Such labors at that time were tagged as ""Anti-Revolutionist"" , ""The Left Extremist"", ""Stinking Old Nine"" or ""The 5th Black Category Member"". There were many carelessly written labeling names or words that didn't comply with that atrocious era. I was just amazed how the billion Chinese would let go of such torturous and treacherous when the Culture Revolution lost its goal and suddenly ended after 10 years living hell. Most Chinese are not like the Jewish people who had suffered so much that they would never let it go and so easily forget what their ancestors suffered. But the Chinese people are such weird species with extremely short memory. When every absurd but cruel movement ended, what they had experienced was just like the old Western saying: ""Water under The Bridge"", they just took it for granted and awaiting the next movement coming up to torture them. This is also explained why the CCP regime still exists so far, and again, the Chinese people are suffering the prison-like deadly control during a lightweight Omicron virus crisis. They are whining, crying and complaining, but I guess when the CCP decides to end the siege, they would immediately forget what they once suffered, just like what their parents and grandparents had suffered during the Cultural Revolution. Living under the iron fist of the CCP, Short Memory, Letting Go and Moving On maybe are all must-have for the 1.4 billion Chinese subjects?"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's always pleasing when a modern movie comes along and reminds us there are still movie makers who understand the basic, intrinsic feelings that motivate our everyday existence. Writers, directors, and producers who are willing to chance making a little less money for the sake of humanity. If you want Mad Max or Superman you won't find them here - so be ready to look into the depths of real souls, maybe even your own! For a story written by a former officer in the army of the PLR during the Cultural Revolution of Chairman Mao – Shanghai born novelist Geling Yan, certainly seems to suggest she has serious misgivings - about what was done to innocent victims in those dark days of political upheaval. While the screenplay by Zou Jingzhi for ""Coming Home"" is based on Yan's novel ""The Criminal Lu Yanshi"" it doesn't give us much insight into what crimes Lu committed – instead, it scores its points detailing the tragic aftermath that all too often follow the grief of separation - this time as direct result of political incarceration. In his role of the persecuted Professor Lu, Daoming Chen is terrific, while Li Gong is his equal as his long suffering wife Feng. The movie begins when their daughter, Dandan, played by the exquisite Huien Zhang is in her teens - she was three when Lu was first taken for punishment by the Communist police - so initially, has little understanding of his motivations or forgiveness for his 'betrayal' of the party.Cinematography by Zhao Xiaoding (The Great Wall '16) perfectly captures the living conditions and constraints placed on the people following the over-throw of the revolution. And director Zhang Yimou proves he still has the soul he displayed so superbly with ""The Road Home"" in 1999. His opening shot through the undercarriage of a passing train is promise of an intense personal journey. The use of rain adds to the feeling of being out-in-the-cold, hunted. Composer Qigang Chen, himself a victim of the Cultural Revolution, adds a rich music score, with piano solo's by Lang Lang, accompanied by a wonderful song without words. If you want action and monsters look towards Yimou's ""The Great Wall"" as you may feel disillusioned by ""Coming Home"" – otherwise, a high recommendation to discerning audiences.In some ways this could be looked upon as being the ""Hachi"" '09 for humans.In fact, this gem deserves a better presentation platform than via the trashy world movies channel - where it will fight for the odd play sessions with WM's usual ultra-low-life porn offerings. Should be transferred to Fox Masterpiece where it might possibly be better rewarded."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The film contains absolutely minimum information about the dark side of the cultural revolution,which the books was all about. If you want to know more about that history, try read some books or some foreign documentaries, because a commercial movie that reveals those will never be released in mainland China and probably wouldn't even be finished, especially from a highly influential director like Zhang.The brilliant side of Zhang, is that if you know enough about that time period, none of those ugly facts that this movie missed needs to be described. The novel was fictional anyways, it is a reflection and a look at that ugly truth from a narrow but interesting angle. But Zhang didn't want the film to be about that. He chose only the last 20-30 pages of the book, beautifully painted out a love story of that generation, and stopped there. It is like a rotten apple covered with nice tasty chocolate, you take a tiny bite, you see a little bit of what's under and realize it is bad, but then you still tries carefully licking only the chocolate cover, without touching or even thinking about the ugly inside, and by the time you finish you will still remember mostly the nice tasty part of the story.If it is the ugly inside you are looking for, if you want to know how bad did it get during that time. Like mentioned earlier, go read the novel or look for other documentaries. Born well after that time period, even I can't bare the pain sometimes when I hear stories of that period. So thank you Zhang, for making some warm memories, and something not too bitter to chew with."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's neither romantic, nor even particularly dramatic. It most definitely lacks any degree of mystery, to its great misfortune. Coming Home is unadulterated, repetitive melodrama. If you're an admirer of that genre, there's probably plenty to like here, but if not, take care.The most interesting aspects of this admittedly well-produced film is the background stuff; getting a glimpse of urban life during the back end of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, where party hack is a career worthy of aspiration and talented daughters, devote their lives to seeking participation in government approved ballets.The storyline is pure, contrived nonsense designed to tug at those very emotive heart strings. I found it completely unbelievable that Feng would remember everything apart from her husband's face. This besides, the fact, that apart from the one early scene after Lu's return, Feng never seems to have any sort of medical treatment. The narrative subsequently plays out to a textbook melodramatic weepie finish.I know it has its aficionados, but to this viewer, who let it be said has found merit in the theatrical showy works of Douglas Sirk, Coming Home is plaintive, over-sentimental pap. best avoided by sensible-thinking individuals."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"COMING HOME is the kind of low key but decidedly Dramatic story you just don't see in American movies (and never HAVE, to be frank): it's uncompromising, with the kind of twist that only makes a bad situation worse still. (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, one of this nation's better attempts at delving into the issue(s) of Mental Health, doesn't BEGIN to get to the core of the matter the way COMING HOME does; Zhang's movie is by far the more eloquent.) Foreign films have always dealt with Real Life problems in a much more Adult fashion than American movies, and the final shot of COMING HOME speaks (volumes) for itself."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I would say the royalty in China is alway considered very important especially for a woman in the past. In that age the Outbreak described, people deprived their emotions to others even their lovers for their safety. When Yanshi came back home and found the reality his wife Wanyu Feng had no memory to him, he was not desperate. He tried all kinds of methods to help Wanyu recover until he accepted the fact Wanyu couldn't recover forever. He always felt happy only if he stayed with his wife. In their eyes, I had no feeling about hatred but cherishing. I extremely appreciate the Wanyu's insistence for her husband Yanshi. I think this film shows the Chinese woman's attitude to love."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's a good movie. You believe her whole. But for me the cinema is much more than a script. A film is composed of a script, direction, photography, makeup, hairdressing, art, etc. But this film, having very good things, falls short on others that are indispensable, all of them are.The actors are great, everyone, from the first to the last. Everyone gets you into the movie.The script is fine. He even tells you things that have happened in other countries, with political backgrounds, and what they brought, and he tells you about focusing on a family and what happened to him.But photography, with those white spotlights that hurt the eye, makes the film very bad. It has good moments of photography but there are many times that are not mistakes, the worst thing is that they are wanted and badly wanted.It has an address that is quite good, but it conforms. It does not pretend to tell as does good cinema. Narrate with the camera does little people know and this is not the case. Someone will tell me that it is not mandatory, of course, but it does not earn points.It is a movie that is very well and you see with pleasure but to be a great movie you lack those details that take movies to be great."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I'm disappointed in IMDb's tone-deafness in listing the Chinese names in reverse order, Westernized with family names last. For example, world famous, remarkable actress Gong Li is inexplicably listed here as Li Gong.The film itself, by great director Zhang Yimou (not Yimou Zhang), is a powerfully intimate story of a family broken by the Cultural Revolution. It offers just enough subtle orientation to facts and culture to draw me into the core of its story about three people struggling to sort our pain and confusion. It's a very beautiful and painful film."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's been a long time since I've watched a film that deeply affected me in a disturbing way. This movie is a love story between a husband and wife driven apart because of the circumstances beyond their control. It also touches on families torn apart because of the policies in place during Mao's communist rule. While the movie focused on one family, it's easy to envision similar hardships befallen on other families during that time.The movie focuses on the family dynamic as a result of the fallout of Mao's policies. What made this movie was Gong Li's superb performance. It's been a while since I've seen her act in movies and I was awe struck by her acting in this film. Her portrayal of a woman who forever waits for her beloved husband's return moved me to tears. The dialogue is minimal in this movies. Instead, the actors convey the sense of loneliness and love between the two people with body language. Gong Li executes this exceedingly well. So much so that I couldn't stop thinking of her character's forlong looks days after watching the movie!Other reviewers have criticized the director for taking just the last few chapters of the book to turn into a movie. However, I think his focus for this movie was on the fallout rising from Mao's policies, hence only the passing allusion to the Cultural Revolution and the title 'Coming Home'.I personally thought this movie was Gong Li and Zhang Yimou combo's finest collaboration (just barely edging out To Live)."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"People who have never seen the original book think that it is bad enough for the daughter in the movie to sell her father. The lover does not know each other. After reading the original book, I will understand that the movie is too bright and warm. But no matter what the novel says, how good it is, as a literary adaptation of the film, as a phone call is still worth seeing. As a historical and human masterpiece that recalls the Cultural Revolution, the film has been criticized for its attitude of ""avoiding the heavy and light"" in order to pass the trial. Return is a blessing in disguise, never return is also a blessing in disguise. Twenty years ago, the arrogant and lofty thought that he could laugh at the Lu Yu of the world. Thirty years ago, the ancestral home bit his ear and the Lu Yu who spoke softly to her, When I first saw it 50 years ago, Lu Yuzhi, who let the girl Feng Yuyu smell the breath and blush, had already been washed away by the big waves, transformed by the wind and sand, and buried by time. Feng Yuyu is right. ""You are not Lu Yu."" She can do, only in the station holding his name sign, and so on day by day, until the end of time, dry seas and crumbling rocks."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The poetic action movies ofChinese director Yimou Zhang have made a fortune. Contrastingly. his dramas are made on small budgets, plaintive yet poignant. Consequently, I was curious to see how a bigger budget would affect a drama.Made in 2014, 'Coming Home' had better production but thankfully remained a simple drama albeit with an early plot twist.The Communists declare an educated man a dissident. After 10 years imprisonment, he escapes to visit his wife and daughter. But his teen daughter doesn't have loyalty to him, only to the Party, so she turns him in. By the time he's released, his wife has Alzheimer's, and doesn't recognise him. The daughter, as an adult, is burdened with guilt.'Coming Home' isn't as memorable as Yimou's others but I am pleased to have watched it, and appreciative of the non-traditional ending."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The combination of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li has proven to be quite promising in the past, with movies like ""Raise the red lantern"" or ""They live"". With Zhangs ability to pick such interesting source material and his incredible and unique directing ability and Gong Li's ability to make such breath taking and believable performances its really no wonder.Now, with their latest release ""Going home"" it seems to me they hit their old mark.As described in the synopsis, the movie is a drama about a wife not remembering her husband as he comes home after two centuries of separation, since he was a political prisoner during the Cultural Revolution.The pacing of the movie was very well and the cinematography was overall quite nice, not outstanding like in Zhangs other movies, such as ""Hero"" or ""Raise the red lantern"", but it fits the movie.The acting of this movie was excellent, especially from Gong Li. It's nice to see her in a role that is so unique compared to everything she did before (although I have to say I haven't got the time yet to see all her works). She really likes to choose her roles to challenge herself and experience new things and that's one thing I really like about her. But also Chen Dao-Ming made a great performance and I really have to check out more movies with him. Also worth mentioning is Zhang Huiwen, she made a very nice performance as well and it was her debut role I might add.There are only two things in the movie I disliked. For one, I think many of the plot devices of the movie were unnecessarily shuffled into the face of the audience. I always appreciate it more when directors make certain details about character and their motivations not that obvious, only for people who pay attention. There are stories that don't really need it and it never bothered me in Zhangs works before, but I really noticed it in ""Going home"", because it could have given the movie another layer to it.Another thing that I disliked about the movie was its soundtrack. A really well composed soundtrack would have helped the emotional scenes be even better. Now they had a nice little piano piece rather at the end, but that alone wasn't enough. It was unusual for Zhang since his movies had such fitting scores before, making emotional scenes so complete.But I have to add that I really like how Zhangs can make scenes touching without using any soundtrack at all.So overall I can only recommend for you to check out Zhangs ""Going home"", it's a lovely and touching story, with very strong performances. I think it is very relatable even if you have never experienced something like that in your own life."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"After reading it in tears, the adaptation is very good, although I prefer the name of the original novel"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,Deeply moving drama. In Mandarin. Recommended. I haven't seen any foreign film quite as stirring regarding a married couple in love. Maybe a tearjerker for some but of the best kind. Not overly sentimental. Touches on political repression and family dynamics involving their daughter.
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"But if compares it with RED, this COMING HOME, directed by Zhang Yimou, the former almost becomes a comedy and, the latter, becomes one of the saddest as well as the most sorrowful human tragedies inflicted by the CCP, the heartless, cruel regime so doomfully shrouded on the 1.4 billion Chinese people since 1949.I don't know if the author, Geling Yan, who wrote the novel Gui Lai, ever read and inspired by Somerset Maugham's REDthat resulted he wrote Gui Lai.Here's the synopsis of RED:""Red is the name of a person to be begin with. He was young and good looking and naturally fell in love with Sally, the native girl in an island of South Sea, like Adam fell in love with Eva. The setting is perfectly beautiful and innocent, two happy lovers would write the wonderful love story till the end of their life.But they were separately by an incident-Red was made drunk and sort of kidnapped by the captain who wanted Red as his sailor. But I can't help to guess it might be Red's idea to get away from the island, or he might passively let this happen. Deep down in his heart, had he ever think of leaving the island? Had he felt bore of his lover?Anyway, two lovers were separated and Sally was very sad and never give hope of seeing Red again. She was forced to marry to Neilson, who madly love her for years. But she didn't like Neilson, she only love her lover who has gone forever.Years after, Neilson told the story of Red and Sally and his failure of winning Sally's heart to a skipper who land the island for stop by. He looked like talking to himself, or talking to the rival of the lover, Red.I think most of readers can guess, the skipper is Red himself not long after the narrative began. But the nice looking boy has turned into a fat, rude and unintelligent man without a trace of his good looking and well-shaped body. I love the description of the look of old Red. I have to say Maugham shaped his character without mercy.""He was a tall man, more than six feet high, and very stout. His face was red and blotchy, with a network of little purple veins on the checks, and his features were sunk into its fatness. His eyes were bloodshot. His neck was buried in rolls of fat. But for a fringe of long curly hair, nearly while, at the back of his head, he was quite bald; and that immense, shiny surface of forehead, which might have given him a false look of intelligence, on the contrary gave him one of peculiar imbecility. He wore a blue flannel shirt, open at the neck and showing his fat chest covered with a mat of reddish hair, and a very old pair of blueserge trousers. He sat in his chair in a heavy ungainly attitude, his great belly thrust forward and his fat legs uncrossed. All elasticity had gone from his limbs. Neilson wondered idly what sort of man he had been in his youth. It was almost impossible to imagine that this creature of vast bulk had ever been a boy who ran about. ""Similar to Red, Sally now was an old woman, fat, shapeless, bore and even darker. The two young lovers have changed and they didn't even recognize each other. Love could be a merciless joke played on unsatisfied human being by TIME. As a reader, my feeling towards three characters have changed as well. I feel pity on Sally at the beginning but now she seems quite stupid and bored. She had insisted on something that no longer exist and never tried to care for those who loved her. Neilson is such a tragedy figure. He was pretty sick and came to the island to die peacefully but God gave him a chance to survive; he has put all his effort and love on a woman who would never return his love; the love then turn into hatred; now he know two young lovers have become silly old man and woman, he has reach to the end of a love journey-he was no longer care of the woman he loved, no love, no hatred, nothing. He just want to walk away, to have his life without bother with being loved or not.""The tragedy of love is indifference.""The story ends. I sighed and wondered:Is this the true face of LOVE? ""The essential element of love is a belief in its own eternity"". But in reality,Love looks like a silly broken dream. It is so changeable and very easy to turn into ugliness.""But Coming Home is a tragic, heart-breaking movie with heavy burden to our heart. Feng Wanyu lost her memory, Sally never did. But Feng holding onto a messed up image of her husband, Sally only kept her memory of Red as a forever young red hairs handsome playboy-like sailor. Lu suffered so much from an exiled hard labor, Red never encountered anything bad. Feng and Lu's tragedy was further tormented by their daughter's brainwashed hatred to her father during the Cultural Revolution, an era that CCP encouraged children to treat their parents as Public Enemy No.1, to snitch on their disloyalty to Communist Party. It's a more complicated story, an ultimate human tragedy."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,Una immensa storia d'amore. L ho guardato in lingua originale.
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"""Coming Home"" may not be deep in plot; but, the emotions are sincere and very touching. In it's nature, amnesia is tragic and any story that involves it will most probably evoke sadness, despair, and empathy not just towards the character who has it but also the people around him/her. The movie did this very well. Characters and scenes are well-developed.One thing that makes the story compelling is the background layer of the Cultural Revolution. It put the three main characters in difficult situations and distant relationship. It caused a girl, who grew up without a father by her side, to betray her very own father. It caused a woman to live a different life- a life without the man who she loves so much. It made her break ""rules"". And, it caused a man, who longed to see his family after a very long time, to escape a strict and unfair ""authority"".It's a story about forgiveness. It's about hope. It's about the struggle of accepting the things you don't want to happen. It's a heartfelt relatable family drama that draws emotions from difficult deep experiences in life.Gong Li's performance is exceptional. Actors playing the other two main characters are great as well. It's a well-edited film with just the right pace."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"It's basically another version of Notebook in the darkest age of new China. A romance after dark. A history we haven't experienced and nearly forgotten but a history we should all remember.The story is not related due to my age, but I still couldn't help crying when watching this film, not just for the helplessness of the time, but more.for the everlasting love."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I like the story, the performance, and entire background of the dark time of China when lots of people suffered their lives, lost their loved ones, turned on each other to survive. But I think it's kind of much less harsh compared to Zhang's early films."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The movie is moving,it conveys such emotions we are losing now.it seems that Yimou Zhang has critical thinking about that period history of 1970s.I don't know how many films Zhang used the stories of the period ,but here Coming Home a new one,an awesome one! Gong Li and Chen Daoming's performance is wonderful,they truly expressed the emotions two lovers should have. When the movie was on,it got good reviews and was highly recommended! It worth it! The main audience are the old who experienced the history. Maybe Zhang hopes more young go to watch the movie ,because he wants people born in nearly years to know the story and get something from it and remember . I think we should get to know the history and remember it"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"This movie is just ridiculous. We can know what the end will be 20min after the movie started, and we can even know what brought this movie to the end after half an hour. The movie will not come to an end because time is not up and the unrecognizing affairs are sure to happen over and over because the time is not up. When the time is up, I mean the time that a movie usually takes(for 2 hours APPROX.), she will succeed to recognize him. Isn't it ridiculous? A movie with a childish plot just wasting our time in waiting its end!!!Those so-called touched moments are just like a funny chess play. We know who the winner is so what's the point? Every step seems so redundant!"
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"This moving is amazing. I liked watching it, and personally, as a student learning Mandarin Chinese, i enjoyed picking up bits of the language. However, this movie is not something you want to watch after a bad day at school, or when tissues are scarce. The ending is not very happy, and leaves you wanting a ""just kidding"" sign at the end, followed by a better conclusion. while watching this movie I cried and my soul poured out my eyes. My DVD player is broken now from water damage, and I have no idea what happened to all the kitchen knives. Please be careful."
回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"The story seems simple. A professor imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution escapes briefly and tries unsuccessfully to see his wife. After the Cultural Revolution he returns to find that his wife doesn't remember him, confusing him with the party official who abused her. Every month on the 5th she goes to the train station awaiting her husband's promised arrival.Is there a parable here about China's wrestling, not only with the meaning of the Cultural Revolution, but also with the tragedy of June 4?

回家,Coming Home (2014),,2014,2014.5.16,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie walking in, the only reason I was there was Gong LI. As story goes, I was totally obserbed in that time,so touchable ,so wonderful."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Michael Shannon should get at least an Academy Award for his performance in this movie. This guy can act and you lose the person and totally see the characters he portrays. Reminds me of Daniel Day Lewis.Anyway, I had never heard of this Kuklinsky person and it was interesting to see his story. The multiplicity of his lifestyle had to be a killer (no pun intended) to live out. I don't know of many actors who could go from one to the other so effortlessly. From cold-hearted killer to nice person to ragging man to loving husband and father. Michael Shannon can do this well. And those subtle expressions of his! They're great. Icy. Kind. Murderous.I'm not a fan of Winona Ryder but I liked her portrayal of the Mrs. in this movie. She was believable and really had the suffering wife thing down.While leaving the movie I ran into a gentleman who had watched the actual documentary of Kuklinsky's life and he said the movie was a good portrayal of the facts. That is a good thing to hear because this kind of story like lends itself to Hollywood sensationalism. And while some of that may have happened, it was a good movie about a bad man. Did I feel sorry for Kuklinsky at the end? Yes...well actually it was pity that I felt."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Greetings again from the darkness. Dramatizations are at their best when actual footage of the subject or event doesn't exist. They can be an effective way to highlight a particularly interesting story or person with details we might not otherwise access. Richard Kuklinski's story is fascinating and frightening. He is known as the mob's most prolific hit-man/contract killer. Writer/director Arial Vromen has adapted Anthony Bruno's novel for the screen, and wisely cast Michael Shannon in the lead. It makes a nice companion piece to the chilling 1992 documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer.The movie is dominated by the hulking presence of Shannon as Richard Kuklinski. Shannon is no match for the physical size of Kuklinski, but his movements and the camera angles capture the powerful and imposing monster that he was. If you are unfamiliar with Kuklinski's story, he killed somewhere between 100-250 people. His missions were carried forth in cold-blooded, heartless and widely disparate manners. Additionally, he often dismembered his victims and froze bodies and parts to prevent the actual time of death from being established. He was good at his job, but hardly a good guy. But wait! Not so fast ...Kuklinski was also a husband a father of two daughters who made up what appeared to be a lovely, normal family in suburban New Jersey. This guy had an internal switch he flipped from the street to the dining room table. When he was captured, his wife and daughter claimed they had no clue what he did for a living (he had told them he was in Finance). Sure, they admitted to his having a wild temper and even threatening his wife a few times, but they never once considered that he was a cold-blooded killer by day and neighborly barbecue dad on weekends.Winona Ryder plays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife. Before you roll your eyes, you should know that Ryder is exceptional in the role. Her tease in Black Swan gave us hope she had returned to form, but this turn displays the talent we always knew was there. The always dependable and creepy Ray Liotta is perfectly cast as Roy Demeo, the mobster for whom Kuklinski worked. The scenes with Shannon and Liotta together are bone-chillingly frightening. Chris Evans (light years from Captain America) plays fellow hit-man Robert Prongay aka Mr Freezy. Kuklinski credits Prongay with valuable insight into poison and disposal of bodies. It's heart-warming to see that even contract killers have support groups. Other support work comes courtesy of David Schwimmer as Josh (Demeo's right hand man), Robert Davi (as Leonard Marks. Demeo's link to the family head), James Franco (as one of the hits), and Stephen Dorff as Kuklinski's incarcerated brother Joey.Childhood flashbacks give us the table-setting necessary to understand the balance of nature v nurture in the Kuklinski household. Still, no matter how much abuse or misery one has a child, it's difficult to comprehend the stoic evil that possessed Kuklinski. And to be clear, Michael Shannon's performance is his best yet ... and that is saying a great deal. He has become one of the most interesting actors - one who can take the lead as he does here and in Take Shelter, or as a scene-stealing supporter in Revolutionary Road, Mud and the upcoming Man of Steel (as General Zod). He's not a flashy actor, just an extremely talented one.Vromen captures the gritty feel of the nearly three decades of ""family"" life in a manner that reminds of Kill the Irishmen ... the Ray Stevenson take on Danny Greene. The atmosphere and inner turmoil are similar, but there is no comparison the Kuklinski evil. Should you doubt this, I would highly recommend the documentary previously mentioned. Watching the actual dead eyes of the real Richard Kuklinski as he talks about his life is beyond horrifying."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"In 1964, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) dates Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder) and kills a man that made an offensive comment about her during a game of pool.

When his boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) closes the laboratory where Kuklinski works, he is invited to work as contract hit man after a test killing a homeless man. Along the years he works for Roy but he falls in disgrace when he let a teenager hooker that witnessed a killing freely go since he does not kill children. Kuklinski begins to work independently as a free-lancer irritating Roy that threatens his family and him. In 1986, Kuklinski is arrested by the police after committing more than one hundred murders.""The Iceman"" is a film with the impressive true story of a family man and notorious cold blood killer. It is impressive how a man could be a good father and husband and also a contract killer and hide this secret from his family for twenty-two years. The great cast is another plus in this great film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Homem de Gelo"" (""The Iceman"")"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Having read Philip Carlo's biography of Richard Kuklinski 'The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer', I can say that Ariel Vromen's big screen adaptation 'The Iceman' is a big disappointment. While the author had a habit of repeating himself and some of Richard's recollections seemed rather dubious in places, Carlo's lengthy book was an engrossing read, I enjoyed it very much.The problem with the film is that it's awfully constructed; it's all so terribly rushed. It fails to develop both the narrative and subsequently the character of Richard Kuklinski, glossing over almost everything that made the book such an interesting read. I appreciate that cramming one's life story into a screenplay can be a difficult task, however there are major flaws in the script that could have easily been avoided – the screenplay should've been scrapped and completely rewritten. His unspeakably awful childhood, for instance, is covered with an utterly perfunctory flashback scene that lasts for all of about 15 seconds. This is a fatal mistake, because it was his harrowing formative years that shaped Richard.Stanley Kuklinski, his deeply cruel father, conditioned his son with the daily violence he inflicted upon his whole family. After Stanley dealt Richard's brother Florian a particularly malicious beating, he died from his injuries; the police were told that he fell down a flight of stairs. Richard's mother was also a callous, unpleasant person; despite her zealous religious values she had no qualms about battering her children with a broom handle. Even when Richard sought solitude in the placidity of his local church as an altar boy, nuns would punish him by splitting the skin on his knuckles with the edge of a metal ruler. All of the relentless anguish was compounded by his family's total destitution.When 13-year-old Richard also became the victims of local bullies, it all became too much for him – he beat one of them to death with a pole and discarded his body with brutal efficiency. Kuklinski recalled that it was at this moment that he discovered 'it was better to give than receive'. The passages of Carlo's book that cover his youth make for appalling reading; unfortunately none of this power is to be found in Ariel Vromen's rather boring adaptation.Lacking also are the details of Kuklinski's career. The book recalls Kuklinski's methods of murder, the way he stalked his prey and his utter indifference towards his victims' suffering. Very little of this was explored in the film, we get little more than a brief montage of random people being blown away – it's all so damn rushed and disorganised. Considering what a desperately violent individual Kuklinski was, 'The Iceman' is a rather neutered production. It has none of the visceral qualities that shock you like in 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas', mob films that draw you into their brutal world where death is merely 'business'.Not only is the narrative woefully underdeveloped but it's also sheer fiction in many instances. Despite having great dramatic material to work with, Ariel Vromen and Morgan Land decided that their own version of events were better. Even the more faithful scenes have been tweaked and messed about with for no discernible reason. For example, Roy DeMeo didn't introduce Kuklinski to contract killing, he had already had a career with the DeCavalcante New Jersey crime family and had killed scores of people both professionally and privately. It also forgets to depict the savage beatings Richard used to give his wife Barbara and the pernicious effect it had on the family dynamic.As you have probably heard, Michael Shannon is the highlight of the film. Much like the real man, he has a steely reserve and an explosive temper; he also resembles him in both appearance and speech. However, despite his best efforts, Shannon is completely let down by the script. While Shannon is indeed cold and calculated, the film fails to truly capture Kuklinski's aura of menace and particularly his notoriety in Mafiadom.While the performances are fine, 'The Iceman' is quite frankly ruined by total underdevelopment. If I had entered the film with no knowledge of the man, I would have found it a boring, mediocre mob film. But knowing the depth and drama of this tragic figure means that 'The Iceman' is a complete misfire that deserves much more, ideally a remake. The only thing that it successfully achieved was the credibility of its period styling.www.hawkensian.com"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Although this film has been out for a few years, I have only just seen it - and it is impressive.Michael Shannon's portrail of real-life hit man Richard Kuklinski is absolutely superb. You really feel drawn into his world at various stages of his 'career', including the conflicts between his chosen profession while trying to maintain some kind of normal family life.There are plenty of moments in this film that will take you by surprise on your journey with the character.This film is well worth setting aside time to watch so you become fully engrossed in the story."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Having developed a morbid fascination with serial killers over the past few years, I was delighted to hear that Richard Kuklinski, one of the most prolific and emotionless mass murderers in history, was to be given the cinematic treatment. Not only was his story ripe for a juicy adaptation, but Michael Shannon, the most consistently mesmerising actor working in film today, was cast as the titular Iceman. Sadly, inexperienced director Ariel Vromen, who up to this point had only made two films I've never heard of, has delivered a by-the-numbers biopic; one that follows familiar genre conventions and whitewashes Kuklinski's story completely in favour of a formula that a mainstream audience can comfortably follow.After being impressed by his towering frame and generally intimidating nature, mob boss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta), who is in the employ of the Gambino crime family, takes the young Richard Kuklinski under his wing. To get a feel for him, DeMeo tells Kuklinski to kill at tramp in broad daylight, to which Kuklinski coldly obeys . Soon enough, Kuklinski is carrying out mob hits for DeMeo, while telling his clueless wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) that he is in finance. He meets fellow contract killer Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Prongay (Chris Evans), who teaches Kuklinski the benefits of using cyanide to carry out the murders, and then freezing the bodies to rule out a time of death. But with DeMeo coming under pressure from his boss Leonard Marks (Robert Davi) for a drug deal gone wrong, Kuklinki finds himself and his family under threat.What might have been a fascinating insight into the inner workings of a sociopath, The Iceman is nothing more than your standard straight-to-DVD mobster movie. Completely ignoring Kuklinski's natural instinct for murder (he was a serial killer long before the mob approached him) and his reputation as a merciless and cruel man, beating and killing men for the slightest of reasons, Vromen even adds a family angle that is completely untrue. To give the lead character a bit of recognisable humanity, here he is portrayed as a loving family man, dedicated to his wife and kids as the mob close around him. In fact, in real life Kuklinski was an aggressive wife-beater; a tyrannical king of the household who regularly committed acts of physical and mental abuse on his family.Artistic license is a right that every film-maker has when conducting a biopic, but when there's a complex and fascinating story to tell, however dubious some of Kuklinski's claims are (he claims to be responsible for the murder of Jimmy Hoffa), then why make such drastic changes if all you're doing is making your subject the same character seen a thousand times before? Shannon deserves better than that, and his unnerving performance is one of the few saving graces here, but his character is reduced to nothing more than a standard mobster, seduced by the lifestyle and cutting himself off from regular life. He was a cruel, savage monster, who disposed of some of his victims by having them eaten alive by rats (or so he claims), or in one incident, he allowed his victim time to pray to God to see if he would answer his prayers, before killing him (this scene is played out in the film with James Franco as the victim).Plot strands veer off path and are offered no resolution, making them completely redundant. Some are intriguing, such as Stephen Dorff's appearance as Kuklinski's imprisoned paedophile brother, who hints at Kuklinski's dark childhood and abuse. Others are not, such as DeMeo's right-hand man Josh Rosenthal (David Schwimmer) who is given more screen time than necessary, only for the story to fizzle out into absolutely nothing, as does DeMeo himself. Given a longer running time, a more experienced director, and ultimately more commitment to the source material (various books and recordings exist of Kukinski, the most popular being Philip Carlo's book The Iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Contratc Killer and the TV movie The Iceman Tapes), this could have been highly engrossing cinema, instead it's a crushing disappointment, saved only by Shannon's imposing performance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"I had to drive over 70miles one way to watch this movie and was it worth it? Hard to say if one watched ""the iceman tapes"" from HBO. To me personally it was disappointing, but I probably expected way too much. So lower your expectations and you will have a nice evening in the cinema. Shannon is great, superb, I guess nobody could have played him better, but the editing, the storytelling is very abrupt and a bit too edgy. Its not a good fellas, its not even close to it, don't expect even a mob flick. Its an OK movie that had so much more potential. YET it is still worth watching since you don't see movies like that nowadays very often. The potential of the story would have been an 11, this movie is a 7 with an extra point for Shannons performance. And in relevance I should mention that I would give broken city a 3.5, gangster squad a 4.5, so I guess people who watch this movie with not so high expectations will love it! PS. No ""the iceman"" did NOT got his nick because he was so cold, like another reviewer wrote, but because he froze a body for two years. The officials gave him then that name. All this is well known through the ""iceman tapes""."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Wow!! What a great feature film for Michael Shannon to display his range of acting and depth of character portrayal as the real New Jersey contract (serial?) killer, Richard Kuklinski. Michael Shannon has played dark brooding characters before such as in his roles in movies like My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, as Brad McCullum, The Man of Steel as General Zod, and in Take Shelter as the father Curtis LaForche, of a family who believe his fixation on building an underground shelter is too extreme. He also plays a dark brooding character in Boardwalk Empire, whose role evolves from a former Prohibition Agent on the run after murdering his partner, to the muscle for a bootlegger. In my watching Michael Shannon evolve as an actor over the past 20 years of film making, I believe he has found his true calling in the mobster/crime genre.The supporting cast is very strong with Winona Ryder playing the feeble Deborah Kuklinski, the wife of Richard Kuklinski. In actual life Richard and Deborah Kuklinski had two daughters and one son. The movie however depicts the Kuklinski's as only raising two daughters. The reason for this deviation in art imitating life may be to reveal a more softer, caring husband and father Richard Kuklinski, doting over the three women in his life. Which brings me to what I believe the director Ariel Vromen was looking to achieve with this film. Ariel Vromen was on record in stating that after he watched the real Richard Kuklinski HBO documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations With A Killer that he ""was so amazed by the story that he actually liked Richard Kuklinski and had empathy and sympathy for him."" Some movie goers will not appreciate the lack of gratuitous violence that would have been expected from the real contract killer Richard Kuklinski. So if you are expecting to see a very violent and physical Richard Kuklinski character, the director Ariel Vromen has purposely excluded the violent bloody side of the actual vicious killings of Richard Kuklinski displayed in other movies like Goodfellas, or the Godfather. Another strong performance was displayed by Ray Liotta who portrays Roy DeMeo a loan shark and drug pusher who is trying to control Richard Kulkinski as his own killing machine. Robert Davi as the middle man between the real mob bosses and Roy DeMeo who wanted more recognition from the mob was well done. Davi, only has a few scenes in the movie, but each of his scenes is significant for the historical references that unfold. Totally away from the humorous character David Schwimmer is known for in the TV series Friends, as Ross Geller, Schwimmer does an excellent job playing Josh Rosenthal, a henchman for mobster Roy DeMeo. Chris Evans portrayal of Robert Pronger, aka Mr. Freezy, was eerily real to character and a very creative role. He plays a lone wolf who mentors the Iceman and exposes Richard Kuklinski on more practical ways to murder people. Again, the gratuitous violence is very soft core of these two contract killers who are displayed cutting up body parts and loading them in to walk in freezers. The movie is less than two hours long and to capture approximately 30 years of Kuklinski's rampage is difficult to say the least, so I appreciated that the director chose to focus on Richard Kuklinski's multiple characters as the devoted family man. cold blooded killer and lack of emotion or fear, due to flashbacks of his own early childhood abuse at the hands of his father. Stephen Dorff plays Richard's brother Joseph, who true to life was serving a life time term for raping then throwing a teenage girl to her death off the top of a roof. Richard and his brother Joseph were not close in real life and when they were both imprisoned in the same cell block they merely shrugged shoulders towards each other in passing. Why? The real Richard Kuklinski felt his only true family was his children and wife, as portrayed by director Arial Vromer's The Iceman.This is a must see for any enthusiasts of the real criminal world true stories. It boasts a seasoned group of veteran actors who shared the screen with star Michael Shannon. It is two hours of excellent historical reference minus much of the bloodshed and violence one can see in any one of thousands of B movies if this is what you really want to see."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman was an enjoyable movie with very good acting, but ultimately quite unrealistic. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski, comes off as a very sympathetic character in the end, whereas in real life he truly was a cold emotionless and sociopathic killer. His family weren't so much cherished and loved as they were possessions that were his and his alone.Much has been learned about sociopathy by interviewing Kuklinski, but unfortunately none of this was used to shape and portray his real character in the movie. Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing, but more as entertainment than enlightenment about Kuklinski's life of crime."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"With 2011's Take Shelter, Michael Shannon is proving to be a fascinating leading man. Just through his presence, he can convey that unstable line between sanity and insanity and bad and good. You can just tell his inner conflict is going to explode at boiling point. It's unfortunate that while Shannon certainly transforms into the 'iceman,' The Iceman's script doesn't call for much of his range. Instead, it's a moody gangster film that revels in the moments where it can step just beyond the clichés while still pressing all the standard buttons. It's interesting in these kinds of scenes where a mob boss forces an associate to give to a homeless person or Shannon lets James Franco's cameo pray to God just to see what happens. It's a well-acted film, particularly Winona Ryder standing out in the supporting cast and it's very slickly made. But the fundamental problem with the film is its rhythm. The editing is constantly hectic even at the smallest things. There's no natural fluctuations that give emotional moments gravitas or action moments excitement. It does end up fatiguing and it lessens the sense of journey and change. Nevertheless, it's still a wickedly entertaining thrill ride to the end, just blunt at its edges.7/10"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Really well acted by the all star cast, and also written and directed just as well. A little slowly paced but this film still keeps your attention. Michael Shannon was outstanding in his role. 8/10 from me"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"A life of crime. Are some people genetically predisposed to crime or is it all about choices?In this hard hitting drama, we follow the rise and fall of Richard Kuklinski played utterly convincingly by Michael Shannon. The man who terrorised many, yet he was a faithful and devoted dad and husband where the constant struggle is shown in keeping the balance between a life of crime and family harmony.One scene I find particularly mesmerising is when he visits his brother in prison and as he is about to leaves his brother shouts that since are both born criminals they shall both end up in jail.Kudos to the makers for conveying tension and emotion in the correct dose. My only remark would be that it kind of lost its way between being a crime drama and autobiography, however whilst it successfully is a bit of both, I sort of craved it picked a genre and dig a little deeper."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman a biopic based on New Jersey hit-man Richard Kuklinski who managed to murder at least 100 and possibly up to 250 victims in a span of almost 40 years.Michael Shannon giving a strong performance as the hit-man with the calculating and creepy demeanor of a psychopathic killer with no conscience who can still flip the switch back to his life in the suburbs with wife and kids. Yet a shade of subtlety and pathos in his portrayal of Kuklinski that we can actually identify and take some interest in his struggles. With the exception of Winona Ryder who fits seamlessly as naive suburban housewife (and the 2 daughters) very unlikely to feel sympathy for the victims with the exception of one senseless killing. Mostly wiseguys, mostly scumbags. We're not all that mad at Kuklinski for the nasty stuff he's doing. Ray Liotta a can't miss as a minor mob boss, all the acting first rate and the characters real. But the Iceman story is told without ice and without chasers, a gangster flick without sentiments real or phony thrown in. Viewers hoping to draw insights or conclusions from all the dead bodies might end up disappointed. The 'Iceman' moniker from his practice of freezing bodies to confuse the time of death.My biggest question for Kuklinski would be, how do you get away with so many murders, so many different methods, places, people over a span of almost 40 years? In the true crime shows the perp makes one little slip in his only perfect crime and ends up in the slam.The movie is what it is because I don't think there's all that much complex or new in a Kuklinski to learn. Abused growing up, turns to sociopathic super bully behavior as an adult to get what he wants and to survive. No genius but smart enough to know when to turn it down out in the suburbs. Kuklinski was an usher at mass every Sunday. They should have included that in the movie."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"THE ICEMAN is based on the supposed true story of a Mafia hit-man who killed hundreds of people during a period ranging from the 1960s to the 1980s. It's deliberately styled to reflect the 'classic' gangster films of yesteryear, particularly Scorsese's GOODFELLAS, taking place in the same era and even with some of the same cast members (Ray Liotta, here taking the sort of role Robert De Niro would have played back in the day).The protagonist is played by the excellent Michael Shannon, of TV's BOARDWALK EMPIRE, and he helps to make this a grounded, realistic production. I admit I'm biased: I can't get enough of this guy, I love the kooky characters he plays and this is another addition to that fold. There are some great supporting actors in the film too, including an unrecognisable Chris Evans as a psycho (the best I've seen from him) and Robert Davi as another old-time gangster. I spent ages trying to place one character only to realise it was David Schwimmer, a far cry from FRIENDS.The storyline is quite predictable but there's plenty of violence and outrageous situations to keep things bubbling along, and there seems to be little ""fat"" on the narrative to slow things down. Winona Ryder gets short shrift as Shannon's wife, but then the focus is on executions and the like so family life doesn't count for much. THE ICEMAN is a dark gangster outing and a film I enjoyed greatly."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Michael Shannon performs with such magnetic power that one can't keep from looking at the screen and wondering just how lethal his next move is going to be. His acting is so powerful it keeps drawing us closer, even though the nature of his character and his actions are repulsive and deplorable. Yet there is another side, barely hinted at that shows his humanity, and with his interaction and support of his devoted wife, beautifully played by Wynona Ryder, we wonder what makes him tick.He is a professional and ruthless assassin, one of the best in his field. Through complications in his associations, he finds himself the target of his superiors and because of domestic obligations he reneges in his contract, which complicates matters even more. Incredibly, this might generate a little sympathy from the audience because we don't want him to fall so quickly. We know this will ultimately happen, but this type of character deserves to at least, overcome and few obstacles.""The Iceman"" resembles other gangster sagas which have been embellished and mythologized since their release. In reality, this film might be more accurate in their portrayal because these are not very nice individual. As played by Shannon, his hit-man has a cold soul which at times unleashes so much hate and destruction, he endangers the lives of his loved ones, and in a truly spine chilling moment, he reveals his lack of regret, with one exception. I was very impressed by Liotta, giving us so much more in a few minutes than all he did in ""Goodfellas"". He must be better because Shannon is indeed as perfect an actor as he can be here, giving us so much with his glances, his stares, his voice, not wasting a single part of his body to create a truly frightening monster, not a special effect wonder, one peg in a machinery stressing camera moves. In fact, the camera follows him and never stops focusing on him. He might interact with different people, but this is his story, and it is his actions that attract and repel us.There are many great parts in the film, and some of them don't have anything violent in them, but it is the specter of the potentially explosive nature of Shannon's reactions that create a tension which doesn't appear in other pictures of this type. In those family life is so wonderful to provide contrast to the horrors of crime and its imminent poisoning and destruction of the innocent. There is a chilling moment at the end of ""The Godfathers I and II"" when Michael has surrendered to the dark forces. Here, one single comment, one careless look, one direct or indirect attack can provoke a reaction that is bound to leave a few bodies on the screen and keep us in a state of constant tension. ""The Iceman"" is outstanding and powerful film making, and if there is justice out there, Shannon should at least get his due for a masterful job."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman (2012) *** (out of 4)Good drama telling the true story of Richard Kuklinksi (Michael Shannon), a husband and father who keeps from his loved ones the fact that he's a hit man for the mob and killed over a hundred people. THE ICEMAN contains some of the best performances you're going to see all year and there's no question that the man himself is an interesting figure for a movie but sadly the picture isn't as great as one would hope and this is due to the screenplay. I'm going to say that the screenplay is what keeps this movie from being much better because it's quite uneven and never really seems to know what type of story it wants to tell. Is it a story about a man who is a normal husband and father but at night is something evil? Is it about how great of a hit man he was? Was the story trying to tell what it was like working for the mob? All of these might be correct but sadly the film just has an uneven feel because each scene doesn't really tie together in any way and it's more like we're just watching some snapshots out of Kuklinksi's life. The performances are going to be the main reason to watch this film with Shannon once again turning in a masterful performance. The killer got his nickname because of how cold he was at his job and Shannon does a masterful job at this in his performance. Just looking at this guy you can see the evil underneath him and I thought Shannon did a rather remarkable job bringing this character to the screen. I'm not sure if there's a more intense actor working today but he really shines in this lead role. Winona Ryder does a very good job in the role of the wife and we get strong work from Chris Evans as a rival ""worker,"" Ray Liotta is perfect as a crime boss and we also get nice work from David Schwimmer, James Franco and Stephen Dorff. Robert Davi also deserves special mention as he's perfect in his role as an enforcer. The direction by Ariel Vromen is good and he certainly nails the look and atmosphere of the times that the film is set. THE ICEMAN falls short of being great but the performances are simply so wonderful that this is still worth seeing."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"There are some lives that don't require reflection in the form of film and surely the true life of professional murderer (100 killings) Richard Kuklinski is one of them. But because biographies have been written about him (Anthony Bruno's ""The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer"" and James Thebaut's documentary ""The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer""), it became a sure thing that we would have to actually watch this life on the screen (as written by Morgan Land and director Ariel Vromen). It is disconcerting to view except for the actors who take on these rather unrewarding parts.The film opens and closes with the imprisoned Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) starring at us but quick jumps back in time to the1960s with a very different Kuklinski trying to make coffee conversation with the sweet Deborah (Winona Ryder) who eventually becomes his wife and the mother of their children - a life that is sacrosanct to Kuklinski. Kuklinski is working as a porn film lab tech until his mob bosses (Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer et al) persuade him to change his career into that of a contract killer. For years, Kuklinski gains a reputation for cold-blooded professionalism who tends to freeze his murdered victims even as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career. Unfortunately, mob politics ultimately forces him to secretly work independently with the psychopathic Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans). As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him. Among those actors who get killed almost as soon as they get on the screen is James Franco. Kuklinski is finally caught by the police (through a double cross maneuver) and is sentence to life in prison in the same cell with his brother Joey (Stephen Dorff).It is a strong cast but a very plodding script that burns out after about 45 minutes. Were it not for the cast, the final judgment of the film would be dyspeptic. Grady Harp"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"For a true life story about arguably one of the most notorious mob hit-man in history (kill total suspected to be over 100 victims) The Iceman sure does a good job of being pretty uninteresting and uninvolving for the majority of its relatively short running time. The reason behind this mediocrity can be attributed to the films lack of quality control and production.Working on a seemingly small budget Iceman can't help but feel like a TV movie. From the cookie cutter vintage costumes, dank and dull cinematography and some truly bad facial hair Iceman just oozes a b movie despite the presence of many a recognizable actor and a story just ready to be told again in a more involving fashion.Michael ""crazy eyes"" Shannon is milking his cooped up psychopath skitch for all it's worth and here as real life hit-man Richard Kuklinski has his moments but one can't help but feel it's nothing new from him and he seems better as lost cause Nelson Van Ulden in HBO's Boardwalk Empire or playing bit part roles in films such as Revolutionary Road. The rest of the cast don't really register and some actually did themselves no favours appearing in this – here's looking at you in particular David Schwimmer but Chris Evans, James Franco and Winona Ryder aren't to far behind.Iceman like it's main man is a cold entity. Not once does it seem like there is any real effort to connect in a meaningful way and jumps in time and seemingly missed plot points work against the film and therefore it seems permanently stuck in 1st gear.

冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman was an amazing, gritty, and gruesome movie that portrays death unlike other films. Michael Shannon continues to showcase his acting prowess as Richard Kuklinski. As Kuklinski continues to kill he becomes increasingly addicted by his gruesome actions, and like most addicts Kuklinski has masterfully concealed his secret life from his loved ones. But unlike other psychopathic killers, Kiklinski is motivated by a basic human trait, which is to support his family. Although being a hit-man is not an ideal profession, it does have a huge cash reward.The movie does an excellent job portraying Kuklinski's tragic dilemma and to top things off Shannon's chilling performance glued me to the edge of my sofa. But this film does have some faults. Some of the secondary characters are a bit shallow and some scenes tend to drag on a little bit. But these are just little knit picks to an overall outstanding movie."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman is a great film overall, with very skillful ""execution"" in most categories. Unfortunately, if you know anything about the real Richard Kuklinksi, you may find yourself disappointed. I saw both parts of the HBO documentary, The Iceman Tapes, and because of that extra knowledge it left me wanting after the film ended. The main flaw here was that they didn't depict what a truly sick bastard this man was. Such disturbing anecdotes that were described in the documentary, such as a day when Mr. Kuklinski decided to test out a crossbow on a random citizen's face ""just to see what happened,"" and a time when he let a man be eaten alive by rats, filmed it, and watched it later, were not depicted. I still found this movie to be worth watching, and deserving of high marks, but if you know anything about the true story, don't go in with unreasonable expectations."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Iceman Ariel Vromen's The Iceman might succeed too well in depicting its subject, mob hit-man Richard Kuklinski. I saw this film recently at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was lucky enough to hear Vromen's Q&A afterwards. This is a solid gangster movie if you're an aficionado of the genre, but because it doesn't probe very far beneath the surface of this true story, it fails to reach the status of a great film. In fact, I think much of the audience left the theatre with the impression that this was mostly a meditation on mental illness.Kuklinski, Vromen told the audience, was a sociopath. As such, he had no conscience, and was able to kill at least 100 people without worrying too much about it. He also had no fear – hence the nickname 'iceman.' Michael Shannon, who plays Kuklinski, does such a good job of keeping his face clenched like a fist that we can't really empathize with him. The heart of the movie is supposed to be the dichotomy between the icy hit-man who never gets rattled and has no remorse, and the family man who only wants to take care of his family. Vromen told us that this is something we can probably all identify with – the hardnosed lawyer or business man who wrecks peoples' careers and fortunes by weekday, and the loving husband and father by weekend, or some variation on this theme. Vromen's somewhat incongruous examples from his own life were playing backgammon one minute on an Israeli air force base, and flying into Lebanon the next to witness all the horrors of war – and going to law school by day and being a DJ at raves by night. But Kuklinski seems so brutal, and so filled with rage that we never really believe that he cares about his family all that much. In fact there just isn't that much time devoted to scenes of Kuklinski with his family, and so this central theme never really gets off the ground.Vromen seemed to want to portray Kuklinski as something more than a sociopath, though, through certain scenes I won't discuss here, and during the Q&A said that in fact, based on the outtakes he'd seen from the HBO documentary, Kuklinskli could be quite charming. Between takes, Vromen said, the real Kuklinski told the story of dropping his daughter off at Catholic school and parking on one of the sisters' spots. She told him not to do this, and he whispered that God had told him to do this. Vromen wondered why HBO hadn't included this in the documentary, which made me wonder why he didn't include it in his own film. Perhaps Kuklinski was really charming, but this just doesn't come through in the film, but would have made it far more interesting. In any case, although I'm not a psychiatrist, it seems to me that it's common for sociopaths to be charming in any case, so this doesn't make the character much more complex. Tony Soprano, if we can compare fictional characters with real ones, was a charming sociopath, but because he somehow charmed us, and his psychiatrist, he was more compelling.Another underdeveloped theme in the movie is that of chance and religion. Early on Kuklinski tells his future wife (Winona Ryder, who does a great job here) that he doesn't believe in chance. But he only becomes a contract killer when Ray Liotta's character, minor mob-boss Roy Demeo, sees how coolly Kuklinski reacts when attacked by another gangster. Roy closes down Kuklinski's porn editing studio and gives him a choice between unemployment and becoming a killer. Kuklinski thus seems to some extent to have been forced into the job. He was 'just trying to take care of his family.' This is pretty thin, though, and I think we have to see him as fully responsible for his actions. As a side note, when Vromen was asked by an audience member where the moral center of the film was, he hemmed and hawed a bit and told us that the moral of the story was that we should treat each other better. In other words, he either didn't understand the question (despite his having attended law school) or hadn't given much thought to what should have been a central theme of the film. There are some hints (which again, I won't discuss) that Kuklinski thinks that God is dead and so everything is permitted, but again, this is never really developed, and so is not very thought-provoking.As I said at the beginning, this is, despite everything, a good movie to watch if you've seen Goodfellas too many times to enjoy it anymore, but want something similar. The Iceman, though, really does feel derivative (not only in casting Liotta) of Goodfellas, but without its charm.see more at americanfilmtheory.com"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman is a 2012 film by director, Ariel Vromen. It is a 105 minutes of nothing but tension and suspense. Based on the true story of Richie Kuklinski (portrayed by Michael Shannon), a polish hit-man contracted by the Mafia. In his career it is said that Kuklinski killed over 100 people for the mob. It showcases a great cast. To me, unrecognizable, is Winona Ryder (who portrays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife), Ray Liotta (mob boss Roy DaMeo), Chris Evans as Mr. Freeze, and get this ... David Schwimmer from Friends (Ross) as Josh Rosenthal.Dubbing porno films for a living, Kuklinski meets Deborah, and begins their relationship on a lie, claiming to dub animated films for Disney. A man of few words, once he is married the porno business comes to an end. Roy DaMeo likes Kuklinski's cool, calm and fearless attitude. He hires him to do mob hits. The condition is Kuklinski is only to work for Roy.As in any organized crime syndicate, times are not always lucrative. In an attempt to continue to support is wife and daughters, Kuklinski teams up with Mr. Freeze taking on hits as a contractor. Once Roy finds out, things spin quickly out of control.The story plot is not much more complex than. It is a movie about a hit- man. Double crossings, mistrust and paranoia. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski, made a name for himself in the '70's. Rated R for obvious reasons, the movie is filled with violent deaths, disassembled bodies and some bad language and nudity. The acting was outstanding. I felt that Shannon did an exceptional job. And I will state again, I did not recognize Ryder at all. She doesn't look old, but neither does she look like herself. Maybe it's just me. Schwimmer will always be Ross, even if he wears a ponytail. His drug sales are almost humorous in this film, because I couldn't help anticipating the arrival of Joey and Chandler.

Mob boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) sees something in Kuklinski and makes him his hit man. Richard continues to lie to his family as he becomes an expert mob killer. Events force him to work independently with another killer Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans). Demeo finds out and threatens everything. The media starts calling the killer 'The Iceman'.Michael Shannon is an expert at playing the quiet intense guy who explodes. That's what he does here. He's great at what he does.

冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Michael Shannon gives an impressive portrayal of a killer who is oddly likeable, as far as killers go. It shows the blurred lines of psychology and how it varies for each individual; that a person can commit psychopathic atrocities but still possess humanity."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Can a man be without emotion? Or a human being in general. And I'm not talking about positive emotions alone, like happiness and other stuff. There is also anger and madness. While the man portrayed by Michael Shannon here might seem like that at first, he is anything but somebody without emotion. He is just masquerading it. He's someone broiling from the inside.I haven't seen interviews with the ""original"" man, but if you take into account that he was a psychopath/sociopath, I'm not sure, anything he said should be taken into account. Or at least not worry too much about it that is. Michael Shannon performs on a level that is just devastating. He makes an unlikeable character believable and almost sympathetic. It's about survival and about what he cherishes in life. Someone said, that the persons near to him are like possessions. I'd like to differ.In his own crazy mind, he cares for them. In a unique way of course, but it's like a ""mother instinct"" if you want. We don't get too much back-story about the man at first, but eventually enough to paint a picture of him (especially during a visit to prison, where he meets a person that was close to him, reminding him of his past). There are also flashbacks, that help build the character. I don't know how close this all is, as I said, to the real ""story"", but it works more than neatly for the movie."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The film is based on the true life story of hitman Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon). Richard starts out making copies of porno films for the mob when Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes his talent and turns him into a hitman. The story goes that his family didn't know anything about his hitman life, most likely made up by their attorney. It is said he killed over 100 men, although we only get the main hits. A montage of hits done to some good background music would have given us a better feel for his notoriety. One story is that Kuklinski killed Hoffa. The film avoids that controversy.The film is gritty, but doesn't offer the action of a fictional production. Richard lived a quiet life and didn't flaunt his wealth, a simple requirement for someone to be a long term hitman. By the end of the film, you start to sympathize with the Iceman. On the negative side, I was really expecting accents from the folks in New Jersey. Winona Ryder sounded more like she was from Ohio, as did most of the cast.Realistic film. Worth viewing as a history or as crime drama.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex and nudity."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Robert Davi makes that astute observation in my summary line as his character Leo Merks, and what makes it so savvy is that Leo got a couple of bullets from Iceman Ritchie Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) immediately after. He found out what random meant first hand. I liked Shannon in his portrayal here, giving the 'iceman' connotation a pretty good workout. Loving husband and father on the outside, a stone cold killer on the inside which by the time the film is over, we learn that he was credited with the murders of over a hundred people. The story demonstrates just how precarious it can be working in a mob environment, as loyalties have a way of bouncing from one crime boss to another, and with a good ear to the ground like Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) had, it's not long before the word on the street manages to level the playing field among rivals. I was kind of surprised to read a couple reviews on this board in which the writers wound up sympathizing with the fate of Kuklinski at the end of the story. You can't blame it on the screenplay, as the guy's stock in trade was murder and he committed more than his share. Pity might be more like it, but ultimately, the Iceman made his own bed and had to pay the price when his criminal life caught up with him."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Son of Polish immigrants, Richard Kuklinski was a real murderer for hire in the NJ and NY areas, from the 1950s to the 1980s. He wasn't emotionally involved with his killings, in his own words after being sent to prison, ""I was a hard-working expediter, of sorts."" He was paid well, he used the money for his family. This was his job, he didn't question it, he killed the people he was told to kill. He actually got to enjoy the thrill of the planning and hunt. He got the nickname ""Iceman"" because he often would freeze the bodies for a period of time then put them out for discovery, obscuring discovery of the actual time of death.During certain times he would experiment with new killing techniques, he would do this with strangers, for no other reason than to see if his new technique would work.Kuklinski was a big man, about 6-5 and around 300 pounds. In this movie he is played well by Michael Shannon, who himself is about 6-3, although not as heavy. Shannon gets Kuklinski's mannerisms and speech patterns just right, and what we see on screen is an excellent depiction. Shannon shows us once more that he is one of the better actors working today.Many of the scenes which involve killings are like Kuklinski himself describes in his prison interviews, which are fascinating in their own right, and widely available on the internet video sites.In spite of his cold-blooded manner as a killer for hire, in his home life he was very devoted to his family, especially towards his children. Until he was arrested and eventually convicted, none of his family members ever knew about his contract work.Winona Ryder of shoplifting fame is really good as his wife, Barbara, who in this movie is called Deborah . Chris Evans as Mr. Freezy and Ray Liotta as Demeo were two of the other mob guys.Really good movie of a very demented, cold-blooded killer who eventually died in prison."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Having read and seen the documentary about The Iceman I was a little scared that they would have gone all Hollywood on it but I was pleasantly surprised.A few details of his life were not accurate, but the movie does not focus on that anyhow. What it did do, was to show the man as what I would have imagined him as. Anyone that has seen the movie I'd recommend that you google the documentary about him. In the final scene of the movie Michael Shannon manages to catch his persona insanely well. Almost gave me the chills how well he acted in the last scene, not to say the whole movie.Hands down one of the best depicted movies on a real world person. And if you haven't seen the documentary watch it first, it won't spoil the movie but it will give you a reference point on the man."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRichard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) lived a double life, to his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) and their children a devoted, if emotionally distant, husband and father, but behind the scenes a ruthless, efficient killer for the mob, working for hard nut gangster Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta.) But when he proves unreliable, he pulls off hits with fellow mob goon Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans) which send his life spiraling down.Have a browse around any good high street book store (the ones that are left standing as the recession wages on), and you will invariably find a section full of lavish, lurid true life accounts of those who were involved with/worked for the mob, peddling their stories, spilling the beans on the real goings on behind the scenes of this sub cultural, brutal world. As unsavory as this life is, there are obviously many who harbour a committed interest in knowing all about it, hoping the stylized lifestyle Martin Scorsese has shown in his films over the years is true. The Iceman, aside from being another such account, is also a film from the 'fact is stranger than fiction' staple, where real life comes off as even more unbelievable than something that could be made up in a film. But the real life Kuklinski did indeed fool his family, and even some around him, that he lived a far meeker existence than he really did.But yet, in the lead role, Shannon manages to inject this unbelievable story with a hint of the realism that really was, portraying a man who seemed perfectly capable of detaching his two identities, switching from a moody but loving family man to ice cold killer away from them, while we witness his meek smokescreen start to disintegrate in scenes later in the film, as the pressure gets too much and the brutal personality that goes with his job starts to seep through to his family. All the support cast also play their parts well, including Ryder as his strong willed but emotionally fragile wife and Liotta, as the mean hearted mob boss who employs him, a nasty piece of work who gets him to prove how ruthless he is by murdering a poor, pathetic homeless man in cold blood, without mentioning support from the likes of David Schwimmer and Robert Davi, all taking a risk with a young director who's probably just made his most high profile feature film.Strong performances aside, it never manages to stand out significantly from any other mob type film, and loses it's narrative flow slightly when The Iceman parts company from Liotta's character, before ending suddenly with no clear hint of his impending downfall. Still, if this isn't Ariel Vromen's instant classic, it certainly feels like a stepping stone to something like it. ***"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"If you want to see a movie about the life of a real hit man, a successful one, that is up to the point when he gets arrested, then this is a good one to see. There are no flamboyant characters in this one, no funny lines and not much of what we've come to expect from gangster movies; that is not what Richard Kuklinski was, so why muck it up with that. Writer/Director/Producer Ariel Vromen had a fair budget to work with ($10MM) but he did not splurge on anything fancy. He picked a terrific cast in Michael Shannon, Ray Liotta, Robert Davi, John Ventimiglia, James Franco and Winona Ryder; yes, Ryder did a terrific job in her role, she's back in true form.Kuklinski had a childhood and upbringing that predisposed him to a violent life and the movie has just enough short scenes to convey that, if anybody pays attention. The mystery and perplexing aspect of Kuklinski's life was that he had one, outside of his assassinations' business. How he cared for and the extent to which he'd go to provide the best for his family was in sharp contrast to his cold calculating behavior as a killer. Vromen did a splendid job bringing this out with his movie.Picking Michael Shannon to play, Kuklinski was the most important decision and one that was well done as Shannon does an excellent job. If you saw his performances in the past few years you should have noticed him, my favorite after this movie of course was the role he played in Premium Rush.You also can't go wrong with Ray Liotta, Robert Davi and John Ventimiglia for gangster characters. James Franco had a short but very effective role in the movie and allows us to see a cold cold Kuklinski at work; about that, you'll probably go 'Ahh, I see!' when you watch the movie. This movie is one I liked a lot and if you feel the same way, you may want to check out 'Kill the Irishman'."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman is based on the life of Richard Kuklinski, who is thought to have murdered somewhere between 100 and 250 people from the 50s through the 80s (authorities suspect there were many more slayings than the roughly 100 he confessed to). Most of those occurred while he worked as a contract killer for various New York and New Jersey crime families, but Kuklinski also admits to numerous killings outside of his hit-man duties. His story gained a wider audience with a couple of HBO documentaries in 1992 and 2002, respectively, where Kuklinski recalled his crimes while demonstrating a disturbing lack of remorse for committing them (he died in prison in 2006 while serving the five consecutive life sentences that were handed down in 1988). Playing Kuklinski is Michael Shannon, probably best known for his work on HBO's Boardwalk Empire and the films Take Shelter and Revolutionary Road. The interesting cast directed by Ariel Vroman includes Winona Ryder as Kuklinski's wife, Deborah, Ray Liotta and Robert Davi in familiar mobster roles, David Schwimmer playing one of their flunkies, Chris Evans as another contract killer, and James Franco and Stephen Dorff in brief one-scene roles (Franco was originally supposed to play Evans' part until a scheduling conflict arose).The middle years of Kuklinski's life make up the majority of the film, starting in the late 60s where we briefly see him courting and marrying Deborah, while hiding from her his dominant dark side and the fact that he works as a porn bootlegger. That job provides a springboard into the organized crime world, where Kuklinski soon finds himself working for Liotta's Gambino crime family-affiliated character and carrying out thuggish duties that include contract killings. Eventually, Kuklinski finds whacking employment with other upper-level east coast crime organizations, telling Deborah, their three kids, friends, and neighbours that he works in the world of finance. At this point, we're well into the 70s, meaning a number of the actors are sporting some serious porn 'stache facial hair. I had a flashback to my Cloud Atlas screening the day before, where some of the heavily made-up actors were virtually unrecognizable. In this case, Evans was on screen for several minutes before I realized it was him underneath the handlebar moustache, long hair, and glasses, looking radically different from his clean-cut Captain America character. His wisecracking Robert character is probably the best thing about The Iceman, which isn't a good thing when you consider that the role is relatively minor. The dancing scene involving him and Kuklinski, where the latter takes out their target with poison on a crowded disco floor while Blondie's ""Heart Of Glass"" pumps over the soundtrack, has a twistedly dark humour to it. The stark duality of Kuklinski's life as both family man and sociopath is one of his most interesting aspects, but the film fails to exploit this angle to its full potential. His modus operandi involved the unusual habit of employing various killing methods, like poisonings, explosives, strangulations, and the usage of assorted kinds of weapons, plus temporarily freezing many of his victims (hence the nickname) to confound the police as to their times of death, if the bodies were ever found. It's another pretty fascinating nugget for the film to work with, but The Iceman comes up short once again in terms of creatively exploring this potentially rich plot point. Shannon is a fantastic actor who excels at playing complex, troubled characters, as anyone who has seen his work in any of the aforementioned projects can attest to (I'll also throw in his memorable turn in The Runaways as Kim Fowley, that band's creepy svengali-ish manager). The actor can't rise above the too well-trodden crime movie territory that The Iceman inhabits, however, resulting in a hollow effort that feels like a shamefully wasted opportunity. Of the ten films I saw at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, The Iceman easily ranks as my biggest disappointment."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"This movie let me down in so many ways. I do understand that most of the time the book is better then the movie for obvious reasons. Time restrictions,budget and movie rating system. But to not even come close and Im talking not even in the same ball park is a huge let down.Spoiler coming.... Biggest error of the movie was that the director failed to show how heartless ""The Iceman"" really was. Let me explain.In the book ""The Iceman"" would sample new weapons on people mostly the homeless walking under the East River Parkway near the Brooklyn bridge. The police most of the time just wrote it off as the homeless killing each other off. One of his more horrendous acts was to drive a victim to the deep woods of Pennsylvania and seek out a cave. He would then tie up his victim with food all over him...He would then video tape the rats chewing the victim alive. Im not getting into every murder he did but, This does sum up the point that the movie somewhat just skims the surface of how ruthless and heartless the ""Iceman"" really was.As for the movie as a whole...I rate this as a somewhat average run of the mill crime drama. I left feeling like I just wasted 2 hours."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"I am not a great fan of 'true crime' stories, books, or films. And then, there are exceptions. The Iceman directed by Ariel Vromen is one of them, and I will try to shortly explain why it succeeds in my opinion to do better than many of other similar films (the genre is very popular in American cinema).Richard Kuklinski was a real person. He was a paid hit-man in the service of the mob, who by the time he was caught in 1986 had allegedly more than 100 people murdered on his record. The amazing thing was that he succeeded to keep his real 'profession' and source of income hidden from his 'normative' family for more than 20 years, living a comfortable life in the suburbs. His beautiful wife and two daughters never guessed the real person that he was. Split personality? Possibly – an extreme case anyway.The film works well on many plans. First of all this is due to Michael Shannon, an actor with many supporting roles in his record, who gets here the opportunity to bring to screen a character who seems to care only about his family with no apparent feelings about other people, not even respect for their lives. Yet, his first mistake and hesitation that triggers his downfall is the hesitation to kill the teenager young girl who witnessed one of his crime, maybe because she reminded him about his daughters. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent as well, with Winona Ryder as his unsuspecting wife and Ray Liotta as the mob chief who hires him to part ways later. There is little explanation about the background and motives of his deranged and criminal behavior. The references to his brother and one flashback of his childhood may be considered insufficient, but actually I believe that it's better so. Too much explanation would have spoiled the chilling effect of being exposed as viewers to his dark personality and deeds. As it stays, it's a study in crime with enough details to make it hard too forget, and enough non-clarity to leave it open to interpretation from viewers."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"This will play well to a casual audience of renters who want to kick back after a busy day. Along the way they'll encounter every norm of the gangster movie; the tense pieces, the sudden violence and uneasy alliances, the remorseless killer who is yet a loving family man and regrets stuff. As per gangster movie rules, the 'true story' has been reshuffled to give us a more romantic, explainable and 'cinematic' psyche, in our case of some mob hit-man who whacked people for a living.Of course the centrepiece is the actor portrait. I thought this'd be a good vessel to bring Shannon to the fore, an interesting actor for me. He plays his usual silent skulking creep here. And it seems to me that he is getting type cast, because he brings a personal truth to his craft, a woe around the eyes that can't be acted. He doesn't shine here, because the surrounding movie aims for sophomoric satisfactions, a sort of brooding Goodfellas minus the style. It could take some of Schrader's mellow suicidejazz. But it acquires a bit of dark and damaged life, if you choose to view it with the original causality in mind; a damaged kid who, in growing up and moving through the world, hurls the damage back at the world. The real woe thrown back, Shannon playing an actor trying to balance.How about this in the hands of Zulawski?"

冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Michael Shannon is one of the character actors catchy to watch even then when the topic or method of depiction is not your matter of taste. In the few of them I have seen, his presences provided additional value and, moreover, it is hard to forget his expressive face and height. In The Iceman, Shannon's performance of notorious Mafia hit-man Richard Kuklinski is catchy again: depiction of a man with many faces, including cruel and caring, is not easy, and his character is continuously on screen during the 1 hour 40 minutes. True, the cast is evenly strong, supporting performances by Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, Winona Ryder as Deborah Kuklinski, Robert Davi as Leonard Marks, Stephen Dorff as Joseph Kuklinski are memorable as well, although their appearance on screen is rather limited.As for the plot, I have read that many viewers find it unrealistic. But in the pre-Internet era, when even a pager was advanced technical widget and the use of phone booths was wide, was much easier to live double life and much harder to catch those the authorities suspected. Well, present-day people used to Google and cams may have difficulties to comprehend this... The only thing I would have like to see more how the plans to capture Kuklinski were made and how they found out about all his past - thus the part of the police and ATF could have been bigger. Recommended to all who like movies dealing with actual villains. As for Shannon, I will search others movies with his presence I am not aware of."

I can't understand why this movie has a very low rating here at IMDb. I think it's the most underrated movie of 2013, anyways people know their choices. Some people who have read the book, says that the book is better than the movie but I haven't red the book so, I don't know about the book, but the movie is definitely worth watching. Chris Evans was very very good at this movie, I didn't expect him to do such a good acting at a movie like this. The main role Michael Shannon was good to. What I loved about this movie is the music too. But overall was complete awesome."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Richard Kuklinski bosses persuade him to change his career from a film technician into that of a contract killer.He gains a reputation for being cold blooded, as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career.Mob politics force him to secretly work independently with Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge.As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and weaknesses threaten to collide as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him.....The story is perfunctory at best, and even though it's based on 'fact', we've seen this movie a dozen times before, A person hiding his true identity from his nearest and dearest.But thanks to the incredible performances, it escalates into something pretty special, and when you get Ray Liotta's best performance since NARC, you know even he thought it would be worth putting the effort in.But it's Shannon's movie all the way through. If you thought he was menacing in Bug, or My son, My son...., prepare yourself for this.there are times when I were putting myself into the victims position and thinking to myself 'don't beg, because there is only one way out for you', the best example of this is the scene featuring James Franco, terrifying stuff.The rest of the cast are wonderful too, from bizarre performances from Evans and Schwimmer, and a brilliant turn from Ryder.I've never really heard of the story before the film was advertised, and the film hasn't revealed anything new, but it's a good movie, with a generic narrative, elevated by brilliant performances."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The story nicely balances between the depictions of the ruthlessness of the contract killer Richie and the loving husband and father of two Richie. The two sides of the characters are nicely given equal portions of screen time and detail depth. Those depictions get even better with adequate support from experienced actors and actresses acting on them. I like to see the fact that only Michael Shannon's Richie, as the central character is actually the one character who links Chris Evans' character Frezzy and Winona Ryder's Deborah, while Chris and Winona don't even get to do a scene together. On the acting side I think Michael Shannon's performance here is one of his best. He did enough in surfacing all the characters emotions while keeping the character's calm and cool as a killer. I am quite amazed at how Chris Evans swerves his schedules in and out of movie shoots, from The Avengers, to Snowpiercer, and to this movie, all with significant roles."

冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"I had never heard of Richard Kuklinski before watching ""The Iceman"", so that made it more effective. However, I read about Kuklinski and it sounds as though the movie not only changed some things but completely ignored Kuklinski's unpleasant childhood, which contributed to his violent temper.Which is not to say that the movie lacks any good qualities. The cast puts on fine performances. Michael Shannon plays one of his many heavy-duty roles (just like in ""The Shape of Water"") while Winona Ryder gets probably her most intense role ever.Basically, if you focus merely on the plot and acting, it'll probably remind you of ""The Irishman"" (especially because of...well, just read IMDb's trivia about the movie). Otherwise, it's just okay."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The allegedly ""true story"" of Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), the notorious contract killer and family man. When finally arrested in 1986, neither his wife nor daughters have any clue about his real profession.I loved Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, David Schwimmer as as a henchman (best role he ever had) and Michael Shannon as the Iceman. Shannon never fails to impress, especially when he gets to be a little bit crazy.I am a bit disappointed that Kuklinski was portrayed as a family man rather than abusive. He has a temper in the film, but overall seems quite loving. His wife has said he broke her ribs and did other violent things, and the biographies also mention this. I know it is more fun to tell a black and white tale, but that is dishonest.Of course, the whole story is a bunch of rubbish, some weird fantasy devised by Kuklinski with no basis in fact. At least the most ludicrous parts are left out, such as his involvement with Jimmy Hoffa!"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The question can reasonably be raised about this feature-length pseudo- or quasi-biopic of Richard Kuklinski, The Iceman: why does it exist? I have not seen the YouTube interview nor the HBO miniseries to which many reviewers (and the director, in the interview included with the DVD release) allude. But having watched this feature-length film--which times in well under two hours but feels much longer--I think that the naysayers may be right. The style of this movie is sort of a neither/nor: neither is this really a documentary (apparently much of the true story has been modified, omitted, or outright falsified), nor is it very entertaining. Of course, why should a film about a serial hit man be entertaining? one might reasonably ask. Somehow the director wanted to strike a balance between the highly entertaining Goodfellas and the horribly depressing and even painful to endure Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, perhaps the most horrific feature-length film ever produced.Productions such as Goodfellas are constructed for the purpose of providing some entertainment to viewers, which is why they can be viewed multiple times. Same for the HBO series The Sopranos: people will sit through all six seasons and even purchase the DVD set! The Iceman, in contrast, has much more of a didactic tone to it. The problem, however, is that it's unclear what the ""lesson"" is supposed to be. Don't marry a hit man? Or maybe: do everything in your power to remain ignorant of the fact that you married a hit man? Probably neither lesson is very relevant to many viewers. Michael Shannon plays essentially the dark, Gothic, brooding time bomb waiting to explode, just as he did in Boardwalk Empire. In fact, I found that the two roles were so similar that I began to wonder whether he is just playing himself. (I have the same problem with Angelina Jolie, who seems usually to play some thinly camouflaged iteration of herself.) Don't get me wrong: Shannon does a good job in this role, which is obviously why he was chosen as the lead in The Iceman, but I had a hard time not thinking of Boardwalk Empire while watching The Iceman, particularly when talk of Atlantic City came up!I do feel that I may have learned a bit about Richard Kuklinski. But the movie was not entertaining in the least. In fact, at several points, I found myself watching the counter on my DVD player and marveling that so little time had elapsed. Needless to say, I won't be watching this movie again. If I were to compare the problem with another example, it would be Fail Safe versus Dr. Strangelove. Both films treat more or less the same topic (the specter of nuclear apocalypse). The former was serious as a heart attack and not very fun to watch. The latter, while still a trenchant critique, managed miraculously also to induce a great deal of cathartic laughter. Should we laugh about topics this serious? Why not: we're all going to die!"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"In this day and age, most of us would not expect to get away with committing murder once... let alone hundreds of times over the course of 30 years! But in 1960's and 70's New York, apparently anything was possible! Richard Kuklinski stands out as straddling the line between serial killer and mob hitman. Was he a professional who just happened to have a murderous temper, or a dangerous psychopathic maniac who just happened to find employment in doing it? This movie falls short of answering a lot of these questions, but most likely it would simply be ""yes"".While not really as big of a social commentary about the seedy underbelly of the city at the time (see TAXI DRIVER for that), this film has a dark and personal feel to it absent from a lot of other recent crime films. The odd stunt-casting of David Schwimmer and Chris Evans as mobster killers surprisingly works pretty well, and the appearance of Ray Liotta and Robert Davi bridges the film with the more prestigious mob movies of yesteryear. It's unfortunate that the low budget and tendency to stray far from historical fact undercut what could have been the most powerful crime film in years. Michael Shannon shines as the star psycho even brighter than he did in BUG. His presence radiates menace and introspection all throughout. It's worth a watch just for him.I'd like to see a SICARIO-style film about the Juarez Ripper, theoretically an American who exploited the nearly-lawless Mexican border city since the 90's and may have been the only maniac to ever outdo Kuklinski in terms of bodycount and sheer audacity. The issue there is that it's difficult to write an interesting story around a solitary murderer (if it was only one) with little personal interaction. Kuklinski had several accomplices and even attempted to start a gang of his own toward the end (having killed his own childhood gang off as a teenager). To me, this would have been a lot more cinematic, as well if they had tied in how he roped in one of his daughters' boyfriends into helping him dispose of the bodies and tried grooming him to become a hitman as well.I understand there'd never be enough time in a feature film to truly grant an accurate, in-depth analysis of Kuklinski's ""career"", but certainly feel this film could have been a whole lot more moving after another rewrite or two."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"This movie got some of the most deranged reviews I ever read on IMDb. Most people read the non-fiction book or watched a documentary about the real ""Iceman"" and complained about everything in the movie - from not being true to the ""real"" story to missing gory details. Maybe they are not aware that a movie and a documentary are two different things..Others complained about Kuklinski and the mob not being glorified enough, as in other ""cool"" gangsters' movies. I watched it as a self-standing movie, without any comparison to books or documentaries. As such, it gives a rather chilling but probably correct insight into the non- glamorous, sleazy world of real-life mafia.Kuklinski was a hit-man who managed to lead a double life for decades. Allegedly his wife and children never knew how he earned his life. Kuklinski was a brutal killing machine, associated with the mafia but also ""freelancing"". A true psychopath who killed over 100 people Kuklinski could inflict pain without any distress and his only motivation was money. Shannon plays the part chillingly well. Ryder was also good as the hypocrite wife, who knows something is going on, but find it more convenient to ignore it. Chris Evans was for me the star of the movie, playing with some vitality another psycho serial killer, without making him even slightly sympathetic.The main problem with the movie was that Kuklinski besides being a psychopath, seems to suffer from split personality. He is brutally cold and emotionless, but also a devoted husband and father. I did not buy that. This was gloomy and depressing, although reasonably well made. I regret having wasted time watching it."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Michael Shannon is tremendous in this role, he portrays this dark, cold, indifferent man, but still capable of love. The movie is slow - with dialogue that is hard to follow at times. I love a true story, though this one is tough considering how many this man killed. I like that they focus on the man, not just death and murder."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"This was a pretty good movie. Not that good, but pretty good. I love Michael Shannon, he plays such a good bad guy, so that is a pleasure to see. However while watching this movie I kept feeling like it was lacking a lot of what other mafia movies, and films in general, deliver. After researching the true story of Richard Kuklinski (""The Iceman""), I found that it is because the movie doesn't really tell you much of the true story at all. It gives you bare bones at best. It leaves out 97% of the real story. What a shame."
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"Never mind the true story the film is based on, the performances in ""The Iceman"" alone are reason enough to see the film. In this crime thriller, Michael Shannon plays Richard Kuklinski, a man who's married (Winona Ryder plays his wife Deborah) and has two beautiful daughters. They are completely unaware that he is a ruthless assassin for the mob and has been for years. The film follows the man's life from the beginning of his employment to the mob in the 1960's until his death in 2006.A word ahead of time, I'm basing my review solely on the film, not having done any research on the real-life person. If there are facts in the film that have been fudged, so be it. I'm talking about Richard Kuklinski as portrayed in this movie. That said the fascinating part of this film is Kuklinski himself. You get only limited glimpses into his past, but here's what you know: he's got a brother that's in prison for life, a history of violence (and perhaps even murder) and he had an abusive father. What I liked is that even though you follow the man for a significant part of his life (minus a few jumps in time) you're still left wondering who he is, but in a good way. The reason why they call him ""The Iceman"" is because of the way he froze dead bodies to throw off police investigations, but that nickname could have been used to describe his personality. The man is absolutely ruthless. He will kill anyone in the blink of an eye in a way that's almost reckless. It's as if he has no sense of self-preservation or control, except for when it comes to his family. One thing I hate above all when it comes to movies about killers is when they come up with a lame explanation about what makes them able to kill. I think back at Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" and how it did absolutely everything wrong because it over explained everything. Here, you get just enough to feel like you can kind of get close to the key, but not so close that you would be comfortable around him. That's the way to do it.Another element that I really enjoyed is the strange relationship that Kuklinski has with his family. Throughout the film, he insists many times that he does not care about anything aside from his wife and daughters. This man was not a serial killer because killing didn't seem to particularly excite him and it was not to get any form of attention, it's just that he was good at murder and since it didn't affect him emotionally at all, he just kept doing it. He is a strange paradox in the sense that on the one hand, he wants to have a normal life with a family and a house and in a way I feel like he would have wanted to have quiet life running or being employed at a regular place of legitimate business but he refuses to do anything but high-paying jobs that include murder. Because of his enigmatic nature and a fantastic performance from Michael Shannon, you are compelled to keep watching, even as you become disgusted by the man.This is a solid film filled with top-notch performances. Winona Ryder does well in the role of Kuklinski's wife, a mousy woman that falls in love with him and never suspects what her husband actually does for a living. Ray Liotta plays a mob boss, a role he's familiar with but is always compelling in. Probably the biggest surprise in the film is Chris Evans, whose character I don't want to talk about too much because it would be spoiling things, but the actor is nearly unrecognizable in the role. I found it very interesting, once the film was over to compare his character to Michael Shannon's, particularly towards the end. Did he think of Kuklinsi as a friend? Did he think they might be kindred spirits? Long after the film ended, the ""hero"" of this picture will stick with you and you'll want to discuss it with a friend. It's a little frustrating that the film feels like such a tiny glimpse in a rather infamous career (apparently there were at least a hundred murders committed by Kuklinski) but for the performances and the fascinating, if incomplete slice of life that we get here I wholeheartedly recommend you catch ""The Iceman"". (On Blu-ray, January 29, 2014)"
冰封重生之门,The Iceman (2012),,2012,2014.4.25,"The Iceman is a dreary, dark crime drama based on the life and murders of Richard Kuklinski, a seemingly every day family man that hides his homicidal tendencies from his family. The film showcases great performances from Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder and Chris Evans but never really gets on the actor's levels as a whole film. The sheer velocity of Shannon's performance on screen is amazing, however, his performance carries an otherwise B-rated film. The film, as a whole, works but you can't help but wonder what could have been if the film was in more capable hands. Nonetheless, the film does offer some satisfying mob violence in between some useless scenes between Ray Liotta and David Schwimmer (who is damn near unrecognizable) and some poorly written but well acted family drama scenes between Shannon and Ryder. The real stand-out performance other than our lead is Chris Evans. Evans transforms himself from Hollywood heartthrob to grimy criminal in this film and pulls it off in a way only he can deliver. The film's director Ariel Vorman seems off to the sidelines, letting his actors carry the film without even trying to levitate fantastic source material to something marvelous. Instead, the film does begin to lag towards the end and features scenes where the repetitive nature of Kuklinski's murder habits suddenly loses its entertaining value and even tries to trade it in for some family drama that seems half-cocked and lazy. Overall, the film works as a character study of a violent psychopath. Yes, this is a film that shows nothing new as far as mob films are concerned, but it does showcase some awesome performances that is worth the watch."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"As much as we love the 'Ip Man' star, we'll be frank to admit that Donnie Yen needs a hit – bad. Which is why his latest, which reteams him with 'Bodyguards and Assassins' helmer Teddy Chen, is such a huge sigh of relief for us – it packs Yen's signature brand of hard- hitting action with a compelling narrative to be both thrilling and moving at the same time, and is indeed as good a comeback as we could have asked for.The setup isn't complicated, and fuses the themes in a kung fu picture into a police procedural. A brief prologue which shows Yen turning himself in at the police station after killing his exponent in a fight frames the former, while the latter unfolds three years later with the emergence of a serial killer who is targeting experts in different martial arts disciplines, i.e. boxing, kicking, grappling, weaponry etc. Immediately after hearing a news report of one such victim, Yen's martial arts instructor Mo Hahou starts a prison brawl just to get the attention of its lead investigator (Charlie Yeung), proceeding to name the others whom he claims would be next.As it turns out, Yen's portents come true one by one, and he gets a temporary release from prison to aid in the manhunt. To be sure, there is no doubt on who that is – an unhinged psychopath called Fung Yu- sae (Wang Baoqiang) who has just lost his wife to cancer and now possesses only a murderous motivation to prove himself the best of the best. Unsurprisingly, the film builds to an ultimate challenge between Yen and Wang, the former's motivations and the latter's intentions more personal and intertwined than what you are likely to have thought at the start.Chan isn't a storyteller without purpose, and none of that seems lost in Lau Ho Leung and Mak Tin Shu's tight scripting from Chan's own story. Chan's character-driven tale depicts Yen and Wang's on- screen personas as two sides of the same coin, both of them highly trained pugilists tempted to use their skills to kill rather than to protect and whose personal quests for supremacy has blinded them to the consequences of getting there. It is a familiar conceit all right, but Chan's incredibly assured direction fleshes it out convincingly.His ingenuity doesn't quite end there; by placing such themes within the context of a modern day setting, Chan has truly accomplished a rare feat of making a contemporary martial arts movie; in fact, we'd even go as far as to say that 'Kung Fu Jungle' is the very embodiment of such a movie. The use of martial arts here makes complete and perfect sense, woven beautifully into the plotting and given a gritty down-to-earth polish that makes it all the more authentic. Chan's aim here is also homage, and eagle-eyed fans of the genre will have a field day spotting – among others – Mang Hoi, Tony Leung Siu-Hung, Tsui Siu-Ming, Yuen Cheung Yan and Sharon Yeung in cameos.Yes, many of these stars have paved the ground on which Yen's stature as a martial arts actor stands on, and their appearances – no matter how brief – has clearly energised Yen. His work as action director here is among his best in years, but it is probably no coincidence that he is joined by other luminaries like Yuen Bun and Tung Wai. Each kill provides an expedient setting for a quick burst of adrenaline, with trained kung fu actors like Shi Yanneng and Louis Fan in brief but memorable supporting roles that Wang challenges to a one-on-one fight to the death. Quick, clean but brutal – they pretty much establish the tone for the more elaborate setpieces to come, and it is in the latter that one is reminded why Yen is arguably the best active kung fu actor out there today. From a signature 'one against many' brawl in prison to a cat-and-mouse chase in and out of the stilt houses that form Lantau Island's fishing community to an exhilarating finish along the Container Port Road leading out of the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals, Yen impresses with his speed, agility and execution. In particular, the latter ranks as one of his best in intensity and inventiveness, especially with a wowing mid-section that sees Yen and Wang duelling with wooden poles.If Wang ever seemed an odd choice for Yen's opponent given his filmography, the Shaolin-trained Mainland actor finally redeems himself here. This isn't their first match-up – that ignominy goes to the atrocious 'Iceman 3D' – but seeing Wang fight the way he does here is truly an eye-opener, firmly putting to rest any doubts of his ability in a physically demanding role like this. Wang is also chillingly good as the snarling murderer whose hood hides a deliberately scarred face, but is equally persuasive when portraying the part of a loving husband to his dying wife. Yen's acting is in equally fine form as an honourable man wracked by his past demons and trying to stop a monster for more personal reasons than he is willing to admit to anyone.Truth be told, we weren't quite sold when we heard that Yen and Wang were re-teaming after 'Iceman 3D', and if you're having similar reservations, we're here to tell you that they are unfounded. 'Kung Fu Jungle' is a thrilling showcase of martial arts action and gripping storytelling, a shining example of a contemporary kung fu movie and an earnest and befitting tribute to a bedrock of Hong Kong cinema."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Granted, they had me at Donnie Yen, but then they gave me incredible production values, a fairly competent storyline, and met the action/fight-sequence quality of the first two IPman's. This was ranked 6.4 this morning, 6.5 this afternoon, and could be headed higher. It deserves it. It's a freakin' blast!The final fight is as good as the alleyway in Killzone, and a clear lack of the all-too-present drama silliness found in many of these HK action flicks. Some of the serious stuff is handled quite well. Albeit the fight scenes are still gloriously over-the-top(not sure what some were expecting reading some negative reviews - i mean isn't that wHY you rent a kung fu flick? Geesh).The ""filler"" is solid, decently acted fare that keeps at an even pace and keeps the audiences interested in the fate of its lead characters. If u want realism go rent ""the gunman"" and be bored to death with a more basic plot, realism, and seasoned actors. It will fry your brain and send u back to the redbox faster than ""Get Hard"". Or have fun watching a mindless, unrealistic kung fu flick - which flies by like an F-16, and is a 90-minute adrenaline rush. Highly recommend this! 65/100I will be purchasing this. You should know where u stand before u hit play. If u enjoyed ""true Legend"", the ""police stories"", ""supercop"" or SPL:Killzone.. Or any modern kung fu flick.. You will love this!"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"""Kung Fu Killer"" (aka ""Yi ge ren de wu lin"") is one of the absolute better Donnie Yen movies in years. I had very little expectations to the movie when I sat to watch it, expecting it to be little more than just another tough-guy-beating-up-all-the-bad-guys movies that Donnie Yen usually tends to make. However, I was more than genuinely and pleasantly surprised at the outcome of ""Kung Fu Killer"".What makes ""Kung Fu Killer"" a good movie is a combination of several things, which include the action, the martial arts, the story, the acting, the setting and the atmosphere of the entire movie. I was really enjoying this movie from start to end. As with all Donnie Yen movies, then the martial arts and action sequences are tight, precise and well-choreographed and equally so executed. And I am a sucker for Hong Kong movies, so of course it was a treat to be back on the gritty streets midst worn-down old and sparkly new buildings at the heart of South-East Asia.Donnie Yen does deliver his usual perfect set of fighting and action skills here in this movie, and he is joined alongside by Baoqiang Wang, whom I don't think I have noticed before. But wow, this guy was also quite amazing, and definitely a name to keep an eye on. There was a good feeling of brutality and honest, hard-hitting fighting throughout the entire movie, without excessive use of Wire Fu. Charlie Yeung also did add a good element to the movie with her acting talent.The story is about an imprisoned martial arts instructor whom is given a deal to work with the Hong Kong police in order to find and stop a particularly brutal serial killer who is targeting the best of the best of martial artists.The characters in the movie were a bit square, yes. And by square I mean that they were generic and as you would expect from a movie of this type. Nothing grandiose here or nothing innovative in terms of character building. But that is still alright, because they are enjoyable and well portrayed by the cast hired for the various roles and characters.It should be said that director Teddy Chan does follow a strict how-to-make-an-action-thriller by the book. And that is one of the downsides to the movie, because it does give it a bit too much of a predictability to it.If you enjoy Hong Kong cinema, then ""Kung Fu Killer"" is a definite must watch movie, especially in the latter years. I was quite surprised with how good the movie was, and am pleased to say that Donnie Yen is definitely back in top form. I am rating ""Kung Fu Killer"" a solid eight out of ten stars."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Old school style narrative for contemporary times.A physically challenged man who could be an inspiration to anyone (if he was not the bad guy) over comes his uneven legs to become a super strong Kung fu master with the goal of killing seven of the greatest masters of their styles.The legendary action movie star, Donne Yen plays a prisoner released from jail to find him and stop his killing spree.The movie is a who's who in Hong Kong action cinema with cameos from some of the biggest and best in the business like Raymond Chow, who was the only one I really recognized by face to go oh wow! (Some of these cameos are from action stars who date back to the 1960s, so they don't look the same)It's a real modern take on a classic style of Kung fu storytelling, with the Kung fu killer going from land to land village to village to find the masters and kill them, but now the village is the urban jungle of china. One of my favorite scenes is when the kung fu killer goes up against the master swords man, who is an action hero faking his blade skills on camera. Possible the best example in the movie of how contemporary the village has become. Everybody's Kung fu fighting, but it's also a cool police drama about hunting one the most interesting serial killers in cinema history. The Don does it again!!"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Leave it to Donnie Yen, to pay respect and make a movie that is sort of a tribute to a lot of Martial Arts heroes of the past. Acting martial arts heroes that is of course. And this movie does have a lot of them. But it does pay respect to almost everyone in the credits too (stay seated or watch them through if you are a fan).The movie also is a combination of different fighting styles. It's sort of a best of. The story is pretty decent for a movie like this too. The stunts action scenes are fantastic we knew that (if you've been aware of Donnie Yens body of work, if you'll excuse the pun). But it's also the story that you want to enjoy too. It might have a couple of bumps along the way, but overall a very good movie, especially for the martial arts fan"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"This film has got by FAR the BEST fight scenes of any other Chinese Martial Art film I have ever seen in many many many many many years. It's new, merciless, crude, intense, the bad guy is really scary (most, the 98% of bad guys in all films, are ridiculous), the quality of the choreography and of the fight scenes is superb, the thrill is sincere, you can really feel the bad guy is powerful and able to harm anybody, so you feel all the time that this or that character is really in danger. I have just watched the second chapter of the Tiger/Dragon saga, wire- fu, which by chance also sees Yen as one of the main characters. And, well, it can't even dream of competing with the level of this movie. I very highly suggest this film to anybody even slightly interested in martial arts, and to anybody liking action/thrillers."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"if you're a big fan of old-school kung fu flicks (i.e, stuff with Shaolin monks, Iron monkey, people doing fancy kung fu moves) you'll probably enjoy this movie. If not, your mileage may vary, and this movie may be a 6 or 7 out of 10 for you. Don't expect the more ""realistic"" fight scenes we've seen lately out of stuff like ""the Raid"", Bourne flicks, or Jason Statham. Even though this movie takes place in present day, it's in many ways a homage to classic kung fu movies of the past.Donnie Yen plays an imprisoned martial artist who's released on the condition that he helps the police apprehend a serial killer hunting kung-fu masters. The plot develops like something you'd expect from a kung-fu film taking place centuries ago. The villain chooses his victims based on their mastery of the arts. He wants to defeat the best kicker, the best grappler, the best weapon user, etc.. in order to prove he is the greatest fighter in the land. The action scenes are pretty good - fast and frenetic, minimal apparent cgi/wirework, and well choreographed. I should also note the producers do a nice job finding and designing creative set pieces for the action, with various scenes taking place on a busy freeway, inside a dinosaur museum, etc...Another plus is the characterization and portrayal of the villain (played by Wang Baoqiang). He's given enough depth and backstory to separate him from the typical one-dimensional baddies we've all seen, and Wang's earnest (although somewhat melodramatic) performance is one of the highlights of this movie.I think it's apparent from watching this that the filmmakers put a lot of effort into making this a quality kung-fu movie. Sure, maybe it falls prey to some of the usual action movie tropes (this ain't high art we're talking about after all), maybe there's cheesiness here and there, and Donnie Yen isn't a great actor, but it's easy to appreciate the little details and work invested into this film that elevate it above random xyz action movies that have good fight scenes, but are otherwise unmemorable."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,Very fun to watch specially if you like Kung Fu martial arts flicks. KungFu style and moves used here are very surprisingly jaw dropping stunts. It may look bit unrealistic but just for the fun and imagination that Kung Fu is a whole lot on a different level of fighting style you will definitely love it.If there's one thing I am missing on this movie is more challenging and long rival fights than easy to the top final match. Other rivals deserves something more too. Anyway but still this is really a good one from Donnie yen. A must watch.
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"For any newbies who may have stumbled on this film, here is a tip from a reviewer that used to watch these films in theatres in Chinatown (in Mandarin) back in the 60s ... because that was the only place to find them at that time.The final fight scene in a movie like this is a lot like the confessional --- all the flaws, sins, in the earlier part of the movie become clear, and, if the final fight is good, everything is forgiven.In this film, the final fight is spectacular -- using a highway instead of a cage, brilliant! -- and not only are all sins forgiven but the truth is there were very few weak spots in this production to start with.The first hour -- perfect. The notion of a martial arts expert killing other martial arts experts IS NOT NEW, seen it a few times before, but it has never been done with more polish and gusto. Rock solid.Off the top of the second hour we have a strange twist where the girlfriend of the protagonist decides to confront on her own the killer, a man who has been going through MA experts like a hot knife through butter.That single fight just feels wrong -- the only soft spot in the film -- but it quickly sets up the final fight scene and -- as above -- all is quickly forgiven.Highly recommended. Could be a cult classic for years to come."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Donnie Yen's modern day releases are always a treasure and KUNG FU KILLER is no exception. This time there's a mysterious kung fu killer - with an amazing scrunched up face - murdering martial artists using their own skills. Donnie is a former martial arts superstar in jail and all broken up about killing someone in a duel. Obviously the cops let him out to track down the killer. It's a simple but brilliant plot used as a springboard for a variety of super-cool fights across HK. Yes the whole thing is cliché - from the gal he has to protect to the cop ally whose superiors just don't understand her - but forgivable. To add to the charm, the production is packed with old-time HK movie stars in bit roles. The only let-downs are that the plot means that Donnie only gets in one big MMA mass brawl (when he takes on a whole prison gang) and that Donnie is once again a rather boring goodie-two-shoes (the ending is a message about how being No.1 is lonely so it's better to be part of a team, comrade). Still, how many other films feature a fight on top of an enormous plaster recreation of a human skeleton?"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"KUNG FU KILLER - aka KUNG FU JUNGLE - is the latest slice of martial arts madness from Donnie Yen, here playing a tough-as-nails convict who's released by the police in order to track down a serial killer who's been making it his business to kill Hong Kong's top martial arts fighters. What we have is a slim police procedural plot enlivened by tons of hard-hitting and well-choreographed kung fu fights.What you see is what you get, and there's little to disappoint here. The production values make for a glossy, high-spirited production, and there's also plenty of the human drama you'd expect from the storyline. Donnie Yen always plays himself, really; whether he's a cop or a criminal, he's always the good-natured, good-moral hero who you're rooting for throughout. Charlie Yeung's female detective provides a good opponent for him to butt heads with though.Really, though, the plot is just an excuse for the action, and it's plentiful indeed. Most of it consists of one-to-one bouts, although there's time for a riotous interlude inside a prison. All of it builds up to an extended finale in which Yen and the sneering villain beat seven shades of hell out of each other for what seems like an enternity, and it's all very entertaining, although not quite up there with the best of this genre (aka FLASH POINT and KILL ZONE)."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Kung fu instructor Hahou Mo (Donnie Yen) is serving a prison sentence for the accidental death of an opponent during a duel. When he sees a news report on the prison TV about the murder of a top martial artist, he believes that he can help the police to find the person responsible (who turns out to be a highly skilled fighter with a gimpy leg, as played by Baoqiang Wang).While not exactly boasting the most inspired or original of plots (the story is reminiscent of all those old school kung fu films in which a villainous martial artist kills the good guys to prove he's number one), Kung Fu Killer is still a case of Donnie Yen proving to his detractors that he's still got it. Almost two and a half decades after he wowed audiences in In the Line of Duty IV, he is more than capable of choreographing and performing jaw-dropping scenes of martial arts mayhem.I admit I was a tad doubtful at first, the initial fight scenes not grabbing me in the way I had hoped, but with each successive battle getting more and more elaborate and increasingly brutal, the film eventually won me over, the final showdown on a busy freeway being an incredible tour-de-force of kung fu excellence (with a truly wonderful spot of pole fighting midway). Admittedly, the fights are not without their use of CGI and wirework, but that's become fairly standard for modern action films, and the technology is used well in this instance. I for one am just happy to see Donnie still leaping about and doing what he does best. May he long continue to do so."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Just enjoyed the World Premiere of Kung Fu Jungle, it really is a return to form for Donnie. It was well directed and edited, so Teddy Chen is on form too! All the supporting cast helped to make this entertaining, inbetween the brutal action, so the story rolled along nicely and the 100 minute run time was over before I knew it! I'm really looking forward to getting the DVD so I can rewind those epic battles! Also enjoyed the q&a at the end with Donnie, his on screen partner, Michelle Bai (who is lovely) and the director, Teddy Chen. There is also a great number of old school faces to look out for, including a couple of unexpected ones! Wang Bao-Qiang was great in his role, definitely one to watch!Undoubtedly one of my favourites of recent months, even years!"

Starting from Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Stephen Chow, and now Donnie Yen, I love watching Chinese martial arts film since i was a kid. After the success of Yip Man. I began to realize his movie was quite enjoyable. I have been following his movie till now. It is a welcome back after ICEMAN. Kung Fu Jungle delivers great action film that is well directed. It gives me a lot of stunning and entertaining. The story is nice and I really enjoyed the epic one on one battles. I'm really waiting for the DVD & Blu ray release. This is definitely a must watch movie!!! Thank you, 谢谢."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"The trouble with Donnie Yen movies lately is they're becoming too familiar. The movies may be different, but they somehow make you think it's the same Donnie Yen movie you've seen from last time. It's mostly because Donnie Yen casts the same actors with him again and again, and he keeps having the same movie flaws that keep his movies from becoming great. The movies usually starts off with a very promising plot with well thought of characters and story background, but then in his effort to create a deeper story he tends to lose the plot with outrageous circumstances, twists, or drama in the middle. It's no different with Kung Fu Jungle. The good thing, though, is he's still able to pull it through at the end of the movie. I can't help but feel disappointed since Donnie has so much potential to really make great movies with great fight scenes without sacrificing the story, but lately martial arts movies from Thailand or action movies from Korea and Japan are doing way much better. But, I think it's the point he makes in Kung Fu Jungle that he also wants to point out in his career: he no longer vies to be number one, he's just contented doing martial arts with the other masters in the industry."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Wasted 100 min in my life. Everything is non-sense in this movie. Even worse than most of low-cost Kungfu movie.

功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"I'm always up for a good old Hong Kong martial arts action film, so when I found the Blu-ray for this movie in my library, I snatched it up. But as I said in my summary line, I found the movie somewhat of a letdown. It's not a BAD movie; it does have some genuine merit. The production values are excellent, from the cinematography to the sets. And the fight sequences, particularly the climatic bout, do have some genuine excitement. But all the same, I felt the fights weren't as good as they could have been. They have the unfortunate trademark of many modern day Hong Kong martial arts movies - quick editing and the camera zoomed in really close. The best Hong Kong martial arts movies step back to see the performers in long takes. Another problem was that I didn't think that there were quite enough action sequences - a couple of more would have helped. This may explain why I often thought the plot to be slow moving, as well as lacking urgency. Die hard fans of Hong Kong martial arts movies might get enough out of this (not just with the many cameos of famous Hong Kong movie figures), but I would not recommend the movie to more casual viewers of Hong Kong filmmaking."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"I stumbled across this movie while channel surfing so I missed the first 30 minutes, but it had me hooked. Fantastic fight scenes with outstanding choreography! Some small amounts of wire work, but plenty of action showcasing the physical abilities of the actors, The final fight scene is one of the best I've seen in many years and had me transfixed from start to finish. i would happily watch this again multiple times."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"The Grandmaster of all martial arts movies, Liu Chia-Liang, died before this movie was made yet makes a cameo during a quick cut to a movie playing on a television set. Liu Chia-Liang added brief moments to his films that would seem unimportant or even out of place to the casual viewer. However, if you practice martial arts for more than a few decades and know the history and watch hundreds of other martial arts movies then you get the point. For example, a man does not say ""Thank you"" after his wine cup is filled but instead taps his fingers three times on the table. Some of us know exactly what that is all about but most watching the movie do not. The Grandmaster put moments like this into his movies for the real martial arts practitioners and the real fans of these films. Donnie Yen does the same thing in this movie. He shows he knows where he came from, where he is, and where he is going. Thank you, Donnie, I get it! Perfect 10/10 rating."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"For every good Yen film there comes ten of these. I don't know whether the other reviews were written by people involved in making the film or 5 year old's who buy in to this type of utter nonsense.Action - Over the top, unsubtle wire moves, completely wrong for the urban, contemporary setting. When someone gets hit they fly across the room as though made out of paper. Ridiculous use of cgi. Why the hell am I even seeing cgi in a movie with Donnie Yen. No cgi is required. The continuity, oh my god the continuity. Someone will be kicked into a rack of shelving, the shot then cuts to the actors fighting in the center of the room no where near the shelving. Acting - I don't watch Yen action movies for the acting or plot line but why am I reading reviews that bang on about how good the drama is. It's a Yen action movie, the whole clichéd list is there. Clichéd female cop check, evil kung fu killer check, Donnie Yen playing Donnie Yen check. Nothing about the acting or the characters has any depth to it. The only thing I can say about this movie is it is highly stylized with some nice shots of the city. Those expecting another flashpoint, special id or Ip man will be disappointed, just more Chinese nonsense here written by children, for children, ignore the 6. rating, don't take a chance with it just avoid at all costs."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Another thrilling cop movie starring by Donnie Yen, Michelle Bai, Wang Bao Qiang, and Charlie yeung. It was so well directed by Teddy Chan, the formal director of 'The Accidental Spy' (2001) starring Jackie Chan, and 'Bodyguards and Assassins' starring Donnie Yen and other famous Hong Kong celebrities. In my opinion, this is the best action movie that i ever seen in 2014! This movie is full of brutal Kung Fu actions which involve punching, kicking, grapple, and usage of weapon. (Donnie Yen) also known as Ha, was actually a formal police martial art instructor, he was imprisoned for 5 years for accidentally killing a Caucasian (to be exact) martial art exponent. And this was shown at the starting part of the movie. Slowly, it moves on to after 3 years, when Ha was in jailed, he saw a death case from the TV which caught his eyes, since he is one of the top martial art exponent, he suspects that the death might be linked to martial arts terms and saying. Therefore, he insist to find the head investigator Luk (Charlie Yeung) and he mentioned that he could help the police for investigation to solve the case. Ha seek help from the prison guards whether can he helped out and meet inspector luk, unfortunately he failed to do so. In order to catch the guards or even inspector luk attention, Ha purposely went into a brutal brawl in the prison to 17 prisoners. Isn't it amazing?The brawl stopped until more security guards arrived, and Ha was bring to the interrogation room by inspector luk and one more male police assistance. Ha started to say out some kung fu 'formulas' example like 'energy is formed' and things like this when inspector luk asked how he could helped out in their investigation about the death case. And Ha only promised to help out, provided if the police set him free. However, she was not convinced by what Ha mentioned and continues asking him what other information he have. At this point of time, Ha have spoken out 8 names from his mouth and mentioned that one out of the eight people will die, but she just walked away and thinks that it doesn't help much with the given information. And coincidentally, one out of the 8 names which Ha mentioned died afterwards. Followed by a few martial arts exponents were killed by Fung Yu Sae (Wang Bao Qiang). Fung was a serial killer and he wanted to be the first in the world by killing every top martial art masters. He tried to kill the first exponent which is specialized in punching, and then by leg kicking, grapple, weapons, and so on. Ha and inspector luk were puzzled and do not know how to find Fung, until Fung himself called the police station and wanted to look for Ha, from there the police tracked down the location of where Fung called from and started to move out and catch Fung. Fung was very smart and fast in escaping which prevent the case to be closed. Until the police force, inspector luk and Ha managed to find Fung house, they saw the bone ashes of have Fung's wife. And they make a good assumption that Fung definitely will come back to pay respect to his wife, and prepare guards, dogs, and boats to get ready for a raid once Fung is found. The part of raiding was fantastic, as the whole police force is tracking on Fung, and suddenly, the officer which was above Inspector luk have saw a video which displaying Ha and Fung was chatting on phone when Ha was in jail years ago. The officer suspects that Ha might be in cahoots with Fung. And Inspector luk point her gun at Ha and asked what relationship he have with Fung, and Ha of course we know he get rid of the situation by fighting back and ran away to catch Fung in order to prove Ha's innocence. Boat raid, fights and chasing scene were awesome and you only can experience it in the movie itself. Lastly, Fung and Ha managed to get away from the police force, and Ha managed to stop Fung from killing the next exponent, and mentioned that Fung must kill him before he can moves on killing more exponents. Fung were thrilled and full of excitement because he knows that Ha was serious is challenging him. And last part was the most jaw dropping and brutal scene out of the whole fight scenes from the beginning. That's about all I can summarize. Of course there are parts that which I missed out as no point telling the whole true story by words, might as well spent the money to watch it yourself. :D it is really worth the price even though it is expensive as it just came out recently. If I were to compared with his other movies, like special ID, Ip man, flashpoint, and killzone, I can say that Kung fu jungle in terms of plot and fight scenes, its more brutal and realistic than the rest of his past movies. Hope that my review is useful to people who have not watch it yet and definitely won't disappoint you."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Hahou Mo (Donnie Yen) is the world's best Kung Fu fighter. He is in jail for killing his opponent. When a high profile murder occurs of a Kung Fu fighter, Hahou offers his services to capture the killer as he names the next victims. When one of those names becomes the next victim, Hahou is sprung and helps out.The serial killer was done orderly. There were no real twists, although the film could of had one, it simply isn't in the nature of the Chinese film makers. The fighting was realistic as compared to the silly grunt style and anti-gravity style of other films. The film asks the question of martial arts being outdated for killing.The only real question left unanswered was why does UPS model its uniforms from Chinese prisons suit?"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Always loved Donnie Yen's work and especially the character Ip man which he played 2 times in recent years.This is not that good but rather a nice contribution to an action packed movie with an adequate story to keep it all going.The some what over the top scenes did not fit the film and dragged the totality of the film down.It has the feel of a big production and it wanted to do to much with all the genres they messed up in writing an interesting story.All the characters feel some how ""off""in this movie and did not seem to matter,because in the end, they all get redemption anyway.If you like action or martial arts than this is your flick.Combination with thriller and drama was a let down according to me but some one might also see that as a plus.I enjoyed watching it.it has a good entertainment value.You should at least check it out if your a fan.I like Donnie Yen movies can't wait to see the next 1."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"MOVIE The movie is story heavy which is a great thing. You get to know all about the protagonist and antagonist. The characters are fleshed out though we don't get to know anything about the victims who died, but all you get to know is that they were best at a particular martial arts.The fighting is solid, you get to see fists, legs, grapple, sword and my favourite MMA. Donnie Yen does fight in this, but the disappointing thing is we get to see more of the antagonist fight MORE in the movie rather than Donnie. He only fights at the beginning and towards the end:/ The fighting choreography is good, you get to see some of the moves CLEARLY, no camera cheap tricks. One of the moves I like was when the antagonist does this movie to Grapple's face+chest+stomach, that was indeed badass because the camera focuses pin point to what you need to see.This movie may not be as amazing as Flashpoint, or some other's favourite SPL. But definitely it is a well worth title, I can rewatch this over again. It is certainly a refresher because Donnie's latest movies have been disappointing: 14 Blades, Special ID, Wuxia, Monkey King, Ice Man -__- (some of them were not that bad but they can't be re-watched again). But this movie proved fans wrong.VIDEO video is very nice, they used a nice camera in this movie. I love the river village, you get to see the waters ripple so clearly and sharply. That is where the HD really shines. For everything was crystal clear and vibrant. But mind you, all other scenes were great in HD.AUDIO poor! I am using Tritton 720+ and I used Movie Mode. The audio which was in 5.1 DSA MA (however you spell it), was fine. The sound effects were nice however audio dialogue was poor. Because you couldn't hear what they were saying, you can hear, it is just that the audio effect is louder than speech audio. It felt like Matrix Bluray encoding:/EXTRAS terrible!!! completely terrible! No nothing! Just movie | subtitle/sound | scenes. a quick cash grab by Signature distribution company. greedy bastards!Verdict. if you have a multi region bluray, I say get the Asia version because that must have extras. If you only care about the movie, get this version. If you want your money's worth, I say you should WAIT until price drop to low!In fact I think I am starting to dislike buying UK release martial arts movies on Bluray, because they are cheap knock offs! Sony did an amazing job with Ong Bak 2 on UK Bluray release because the audio quality was better than Magnet's Ong Bak 2 Bluray release. Man of Tai Chi was a pis's poor terrible blur ray release in UK, it had no extras! Shame the US version is not region free."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"After watching Drug War I decided to check on Shudder to see what other Chinese movies they have. Knowing him for Rogue One,I was happy to spot a Donnie Yen title,leading me to get set for some wicked Kung-Fu.View on the film:High- kicking the killer karate chopping up a body count, the screenplay by co-writer/(with Tin Shu Mak and Ho-Leung Lau) director Teddy Chan takes the enticingly odd outline of a serial killer who murders with his Kung-Fu skills,and sadly sands it down with a miss-judged,too serious tone, hacking back to the ghosts that haunt criminal turned investigator Hahou Mo, rather than going for the more off-beat offering of the killer targeting people who are each experts in different forms of martial arts.Twisting out of the straight line style of the script, director Chan & John Woo's HK-era cinematographer Wing-Hang Wong unleash a barrage of ultra-stylised,peculiar action set-pieces,crunching bones onto and inside a human skeleton the size of a T-Rex dinosaur fossil (!) and the final,full-on fight between Hahou Mo, (played by a great, no nonsense Donnie Yen) and the killer sliding between slick wide-shots catching the duo use the environment around them for weapons, and burning red close-ups on Hahou unleashing killer Kung-Fu."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Just when I thought Kungfu movies could no longer be good, Donnie Yen surprises me again. In Kungfu Jungle, Yen plays a troubled convicted Kungfu master out to stop a crazed Kung fu killer. The story proceeds like a thriller, and the villain played by Wang Baoqiang is convincingly menacing. Teddy Chen portrays the characters as two similar people who chose different paths. The movie slowly unveils more about the antagonist and what drives him. It helps that Wang Baoqiang is able to be truly menacing and prove his immense skill because he has more fight scenes than Yen. In the final showdown between him and Yen, I was not disappointed. Though there were bad CGI and obvious wirefu going on, it helped enhance the fight scene and did not feel odd. Yen is still able to show he can kick serious butt, and uses his trademark lightning fists, and hard punches. Wang Baoqiang also shows that he could go toe to toe with Yen, just like Wu Jing and Sammo Hung in Kill Zone. Louis Fan also has a chance to show his awesome skills this time, unlike in Ip Man, where he only played a comical role. The fighting style in the movie is Kungfu at one of its hardest and most brutal forms. The techniques are less dance-like and lethal, unlike the old Kungfu movies. Even Bourne and Batman would know better not to mess with Yen's character whether it's hand to hand, or weapon to weapon."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"If your a Donnie Yen fan, this film is an absolute must watch. He always delivers in the action scenes, but this movie also has solid characters and an interesting story.Kung Fu Killer (or Kung Fu Jungle) is essentially about the quest of two men to be the best fighter alive. The villain is very overt in their quest of dominance, but the heroes journey is clouded by questions of conscience, family, honor, and pride. This gives each a destiny discovered through a series of fight scenes. The two inevitably end up pitted against one another in a test of skill, strength, and willpower. I really respect the use of the fight scenes to add depth to both characters and story.If your watching this movie, it will be for the action. The martial arts is really well done, and while there certainly is some wire play and superhuman moments - the scenes follow their own stylistic rules which do not stray absurdly far from realism. Each dual features a different style, and the variation of techniques will be appreciated by the seasoned martial arts fan. I am especially fond of the fight highlighting weapons - especially it's introduction, style, and nod to the film industry.The story isn't perfect, and this is what holds this movie back from being a true kung-fu classic. Everything is in the right place - Haunted villain, damaged hero in need of redemption, love interests, and surrounding characters trying to uphold the law. But it takes the viewers imagination to make all the pieces fit perfectly, and while I don't mind this myself, I certainly understand how someone who needs the all the roughed up puzzle pieces perfectly smooth would be left somewhat disappointed trying to fit it all together. I'd like to say the lessons learned make the ending perfectly epic, but really the films moral falls flat in comparison to the action, and the depth of the main two characters.The villains character is especially deep. He overcomes both physical and mental anguish to become a master, but as a result of his life trials, is too damaged to be anything but a killing machine. The hero finds he has a choice in his destiny, which is one of the biggest points the film has to make.Production values are very good. The camera work is especially well done, and the fight scenes gain a lot from this excellence. Always nice to see fight scenes from far enough back to really witness the action unfolding, and minimal edits to watch the actors preform their craft and stunts.If your looking for an excellent martial arts movie with great characters, memorable fight scenes, and a solid story - then by all means, watch Kung Fu Killer.Way above average: 7 out of 10"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"I love kung fu movies and was really looking forward to this, in no way is it a bad movie.. i love the storyline. would have prefer it to not be dubber in English. But thats just personal preference..My issue is kung fu with wire work and CGI.. And i can't be the only one that feels this way.. I would rather watch 100 bad 70's kung fu movies with real fighting (and bad sound effects) over these wire fests. On the upside this movie isn't so bad with it. but it does take away from it.For fighting i believe dragon blade did better for a newer movie. But once again.. just opinion.. although this storyline is way better than dragon blade"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"This is a superb kung-fu flick that integrates generic kung-fu ingredients including a detective investigation revolving around murders and fighting. And the protagonist fighting for what he believes is right. But it does it well enough and entertaining enough to make it a worthy sit through. Donnie Yen is in his 50's and still killing it. The story is really comic book like, but I mean that in a good way for a movie such as this. Since it was immersive from start to finish, because of how they connected the story to the fight scenes. Even if there is quite a bit of plot holes. The plot is about this kung-fu killer that goes around killing other martial artist and the mystery surrounding the case and the motives why. It isn't a amazing story, even for a kung-fu flick standards but it works. And the actor that plays the antagonist role was the right pick in my opinion. He just does that believable expression of the man with nothing to lose who is filled with rage and has that psychotic vibe going for him. When it comes to the plot, they needed to pick the right actor to play the villain, because a lot of fight screen time is with him more than Donnie Yen. The fight choreography is very well done and brutal, you can actually see what is going on without any close shaky cam. And it still added the gripping feel to it. The cinematography is also crisp and clean, and really brings out the vibrant aspect of it all. Overall, this is a movie that is enjoyable. It isn't a mindblowing Kung-fu movie but it's still a kung-fu movie that shouldn't be missed if you like martial arts movies.7.4/10"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,Pretty decent kind of over the top right scenes throughout and I really enjoyed the storyline. Then the final fight scene and ending 20-30mins really is very good. Def watch for Donnie yen n martial arts fans
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Here we find the qualities and the defects of these movies from China and Hong Kong. In the qualities there are the fights which are here rather violent and spectacular, because they exploit the settings, whether they are indoor or outdoor. Moreover, the film culminates with the confrontation sequence between the bad guy and the good guy on a highway where big trucks are driving. Very spectacular sequence of the final confrontation between Donnie Yen and Baoqiang Wang (perfect as a psychopath).Another quality element of such a product: the fights that punctuate the film in a regular way and allow the viewer to wake up thanks to the violence and especially, because what happens in between is a colossal bore.The standard defects of these productions we find a direction of actors and a catastrophic interpretation with actors who grimace and overact to the limit of the tensing of spectators.The plot is very simple: a serial-killer kills, in combat, the different masters of Kung Fu. During very violent fights with a particular order that will allow the police to find his trace. And of course, the ultimate fight will be against Donnie Yen, Kung Fu master in prison at the beginning, but who gets out to help the police.So, in summary: the sense of scenery and violent and spectacular fights at regular intervals to frame a story that we do not care, we must admit."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"If there's any film that can be on par with Donnie Yen's Ip Man, I think it will be Kungfu Jungle. When we talk about martial arts, it would often be period movies. Even in Donnie Yen's previous movie (Iceman 3D), he came from the Ming Dynasty to the present world. But in Kungfu Jungle, the script writer managed to combine the various forms of Chinese martial arts into a pretty decent storyline and it doesn't feel odd at all!So if you are wondering what are the highlights of the film, and if you've watched Donnie Yen's Ip Man and remember his classic one versus ten men fight, you will probably want to watch the Kungfu Jungle and witness his one versus seventeen men this time. He's fighting against a bunch of prisoners this time round, in order to get the attention of the lead inspector.In terms of love, be it (Donnie Yen) Xia's love for his junior or (Wang Bao Qiang) Fung's love for his wife, they were rather subtle.It's rather ironic given that the two martial arts experts had used the ""power of love"" to push their skills to the extreme. Xia did not exactly expressed his love through expressions, and it is easily mistaken as poor acting skills. But me being biased, will rather take it as an awkwardness of an boarish man who is not good with his words and actions.In comparison to Donnie Yen's semi-cool and controlled behaviour, Fung was someone who was bold in showing his emotions. His love for his wife was shown in a very unique way – performing martial arts while she chants the mantra for him. It was a very scary thing to watch him move from one expert to another, and very sadistic to watch the way he killed them. I was cringing half of the time watching his amazing but cruel fight scenes...Besides the great fighting scenes and the fantastic cast, this movie is not without surprises. I was impressed how the film managed to capture the duo personality of Xie (Donnie Yen), his fiery and ambitious nature through his fight scenes; his calm, loving and nurturing personality in jail (by using his skills to ...Read on: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/10/29/kungfu-jungle-movie-review/"
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"I added this movie to my list on Netflix and finally managed to watch it. Lately I have been really wanting to watch an Asian movie on martial arts, and Kung Fu Killer hit my eye because of the name and because the plot actually seemed more intriguing than what I was expecting for movies of this type.The plot might have been intriguing, but the way it was carried out was closer to some kind of TV show, especially in the start. It developed into something that no TV show could achieve - at least not in one episode. First the killer is introduced and he's very distanced from the viewer, but the more is revealed about him, the more interesting he becomes. The same goes with the main character Hahou Mo, and pretty much every character, who shows more sides of themselves as the story progresses. While the story is simple, it keeps the viewer interested and entertained, and the main characters are more than a tool for the story.Kung Fu Killer is visually astonishing. It's colourful and every shot looks great. The set is well designed, and many of the locales are so detailed I'd just want to go there to have a look around for the details. The fight scenes are well choreographed. They look amazing and differ from each other - especially how the killer searches for masters in different fields: boxing, kicking, weapons, etcetera. Every fight is different, considering the people taking part in it use different styles. It's also easy to see what the fighters are doing. In short, the fights are extremely enjoyable, even though they are of course violent.From the kung fu films I've seen so far, I really like Kung Fu Killer. Of course there are many ways to improve the plot, but the characters, fight scenes and the visual side of the film all work well. It's worth watching, if you like martial arts themed films of course, otherwise you might feel watching this would be a waste of time."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Donnie Yen is one of the best Chinese action stars working today. He's not as famous in the West as Jackie Chan or Jet Li, but he is in the same ballpark with those gentlemen. He's not a great actor, but his work is solid, and he's an excellent fight choreographer. His films offer consistent quality viewing for action fans.""Kung Fu Killer"", as it's called in its American release, is one of his better efforts. It's got a decent police procedural plot, borrowing an idea or two from the Kurosawa classic ""Stray Dog,"" but it has very good action scenes. The final fight against the serial killer baddie is a real tour-de-force.The film is clearly intended as an homage to the Hong Kong action film industry. Just about every single surviving performer from the '60's and '70's classics has a cameo here, including Golden Harvest founder Raymond Chow. Be sure to stick around for the closing credits.Recommended for lovers of action cinema."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,I really am sick and tired of these kung fu movies with all the wires and CGI. I was just Googling today to see if Jet Li had ever made a movie with no CGI nonsense? I couldn't find one. I would rather watch any Bruce Lee movie with bad dubbing and fight noises with actual fighting over most all the nonsense of today. The Ip Man movies one and two were really good about that but it seems for some reason they are all hung up on this horrible wiring idea and stupid CGI. Just be realistic. Nobody gets hit and flies 20 feet across a room. Nobody jumps up to do a roundhouse kick and throws 7 kicks in between the one main kick. Just keep it real! I don't think I'm the only one who finds it ridiculous and annoying!Keep the wires out of kung fu! Don't ruin it. Still worth the watch just because of Donnie!
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"A solid martial arts movie elevated by the lead performances, Kung Fu Jungle (Kung Fu Killer in some areas) boasts some serious fight choreography. Donnie Yen stages some next-level fight scenes while giving a great starring performance at the same time.Donnie Yen is undoubtedly one of the best kung fu stars out there. He's actually a good actor, and that, coupled with his amazing fighting skills, make him a very bankable action star. His knowledge and skill in martial arts takes center stage, with some incredible fights, many of which showcase different styles of martial arts. Baoqiang Wang is actually really good as the antagonist, managing to appear imposing and intimidating despite his small height. He also displays much skill in martial arts, and he and Yen both do some great stunt work.The story is ok, and basically just a standard serial killer thriller plot with a kung fu twist, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. It was enjoyable though, and held my attention.The fight scenes are way cool. The prison fight scene is excellent and very well-staged, and the many fights between Wang and his victims were all really slick. There were also some cool chase scenes that were tightly shot and well-edited. The final fight is a treat for martial arts fans, and Yen and Wang give it their best. Pure kung fu mayhem.I strongly recommend this to Eastern cinema fans, and kung fu enthusiasts. You get what you came for, which is Yen and Wang, and lots of fighting. Nothing more, nothing less."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"Kung Fu Killer aka Kung Fu Jungle is an absolutely brilliant Martial Arts Thriller. The film is awesome and also is loaded with very tense and great action and has absolutely brilliant fight scenes. The fight scenes are fast, extremely powerful, absolutely amazing and brilliant and I just loved watching them in this film. The final fight scene with Donnie Yen against the extremely dangerous, malicious and insane maniac Fung Yu Sau was fast, absolutely brilliant and awesome. The fight moves were awesome to watch and see and I loved watching them and I really loved watching this film. This film also had some excellent acting by Donnie Yen, Baoqiang Wang, Charlie Yeung, Michelle Bai, Alex Fong, Louis Fan and Yanneng Shi. Donnie Yens films have some absolutely brilliant and extremely powerful fight scenes, are absolutely brilliant, and should not be looked down upon Not too long ago I watched the Donnie Yen film Flashpoint and I loved watching it and thought it was an absolutely brilliant film and I also think that this film Kung Fu Killer is an absolutely brilliant film."

He does what he does best.. action.. y'all might as well go back and watch them 60-80's kungfu flick where they fought slow as hell and the action was bogus as hell also.. I mean sure Donnie used CGI in this film, BUT he did it fantastically, not like some of the other works people put out there where you can notice the cgi without having to really look at it. I mean sure it could have been a tad bit better, but this is a great film... Like majority of the reviewer, I'd recommend this movie 100% if you love action movies and donnie yen.Ps: don't come barking up my door, y'all could have left it at ""this movie isn't really my cup of tea,"" But y'all had to go trash it..."

功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"The story is good but the action is 10/10, perfect choreography, just a mix between classic martial art with moderns moves."
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,Nonsense story...really bad acting...I saw things in Star Wars more believable....
功夫丛林,Kung Fu Jungle (2014),,2014,2014.10.31,"I went into this expecting not ip man 1 or 2 but flashpoint, killzone type fight scenes...sadly I wasn't given that the fifth scenes were choreographed great at certain points, but they held back to much I didn't get the face crushing action I had hoped, little too much wire work without an Aggressive delivery of pain to add to wire fighting with unnecessary CGi, great story with incredible homages to the greats of the genre, just wasn't the Donnie Yen movie I was expecting, great cinematography of the city and glorious high definition but just not the face crushing jamboree you'd expect. Still a good watch but don't have your expectations too high"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"I don't know why people haven't reviewed this movie yet. Like other South Korean movies I've seen, this one didn't disappoint.The movie starts with Sang-Hoon coming home from having some drinks with his work colleages, when he gets home he hears a woman's scream, when he looks put of the window he sees a man hitting a woman with a hammer. He is shocked and doesn't know how to react when the murderer makes eye contact with him.The next day the woman is found dead and the police is investigating the case. Since he might be the only witness that night, he decides not to tell the police anything, but the murderer saw him and is now after him. Now Sang-Hoon will have to protect his family from the murderer.The movie is packed with action and suspense moments. The actors are great, did an excellent job. The murderer's character is a bit undeveloped what we know is that he likes to kill. But well, it's nice to find a movie that uses different ideas, hammer instead of guns, storms, snow.The movie was overall really good, entertaining, nice way to want to spend 2 hours."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"With a killer on the loose and The Witness paralyzed by fear this movie is as much an indictment on the false security and anonymity of modern living as it is a crime thriller. This is a crime movie, but it is more than that as a man discovers that everything he aimed for and wanted to protect was taking away his humanity.With a killer easily evading what seem to be efficient but disconnected cops the story seems a bit contrived but overall worth the time to watch and the action continues from start to finish."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"This film is about a man who witnesses a murder from a window of his home.While I'm not interested in giving a long drawn out review, I will say that this was worth the watch. The story is relatable. The film is well made and the actors did well with their roles. It isn't without a few flaws but nothing that couldn't be overlooked. If you like dramatic thrillers, you'll probably be please with this. It ended up being a great find for me and I really enjoyed it."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"In the United States, we have a ""traditional"" urban-legend-like story, if anything in the United States could be called ""traditional"", which relates the ""bystander effect"" or ""Genovese syndrome"". The through line is that some violent crime occurs, such as a murder or rape and usually against a female victim, in close proximity to a private housing facility such as an apartment complex, in plain view, where the residents of the complex fail to give aid in any meaningful way.This story tradition began with the March 13, 1964 protracted murder, taking approximately 1/2 hour to complete, of Catherine Genovese, (""Kitty""). The story is half apocryphal because, while the basic facts of the murder itself are known to be true, the media got involved and harped incessantly upon the idea that a large number of people knew what was going on and chose not to get involved. As recently as 2004 news articles have continued to appear questioning that there was any evidence that there were 38 witnesses or that anyone actually observed the murder and chose to remain inactive. In short, while the murder itself is undisputed, the circumstances surrounding it are highly questionable. IfStill, at least 2 notable things were the direct result of the murder and the perception, accurate or inaccurate, by the public of the notion of widespread unwillingness to render aid during an observed criminal act. Firstly, the story contributed heavily to the creation of the 9-1-1 emergency phone system. Secondly, the birth of the ""urban legend"" of criminals acting with impunity in the face of public inaction. Certainly, beginning with an episode of the PERRY MASON television series, this general plot line has appeared in innumerable television shows and movies.THE WITNESS, the title of which is shared across many movies of exactly the same name, tells the same fundamental story but with a South Korean social/psychological perspective. The basic through line has the same, typical, notion that people are morally reprehensible for not getting ""involved"" and leaving some innocent, defenseless female alone to face her terrible fate at the hands of a reprehensible attacker. What makes THE WITNESS's version uniquely interesting (to my Western viewer's eyes) is the collection of South Korean sensibilities that contribute heavily to the content of the story.To be sure, some of the ""usual"" thematic motivations that act as a barrier against witness involvement are present: instinctive fear, desire to protect one's family against the repercussions of involvement and so on. But interestingly there are some South Korean social and even legal issues depicted that a potentially altruistic witness would have to overcome in order to be willing to ""get involved"". Bizarrely, and even unbelievably to us in the West, engaging in any behavior that could be considered defamatory, ACTUAL TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING, is heavily proscribed and,... wait for it... ""South Korea is the only country in the world where an individual can be found criminally liable and imprisoned for damaging another's reputation by publicly revealing true facts.""In other words, in South Korea, just because the things you say or write are actually TRUE, they are not protected against civil and criminal liabilities if those things you say or write damage another's reputation or ""face"". So publicly proclaiming something like, ""I saw Bob kill Alice"" or ""Sam raped me"" can wind up costing witnesses (AND EVEN VICTIMS) tens of thousands of dollars in fines, prison time, and exposing the witness to additional civil liabilities to the actual criminal.As noted in the legal literature, simply reporting the criminal to the police authorities is not grounds for witness liability in and of itself. But should the criminal manage to beat the charge, then the witness is back to being liable again.So, unbelievably, in South Korea, the notion of getting involved when someone is being victimized not only has a moral/ethical calculation that has to be made by the potentially altruistic witness, but there is the practical calculation of the potential criminal and civil liabilities that you may likely face for simply doing the right thing.A wonderful illustration of the downstream practical effects of this sort of legal system are wonderfully illustrated in some scenes from THE WITNESS. Because talking to the press or the police with any information by potential witnesses living in the apartment complex closest to the crime scene could lead to the damage of the positive reputation of the owner-occupied apartment complex (and concomitant loss of property values), the tenants of the apartment complex get together and create a document for all of the tenants to sign agreeing not to talk to the press or the police about the crime.Do something like that in America and y'all gonna end up in jail and being forced to testify to boot. In South Korea, that's normal, reasonable and customary behavior. Watching the police get frustrated by it, AND NOTHING ELSE, is surrealistic to watch. You also get a sense that the police are more irritated by the fact that it makes their job more difficult than they are by any possible moral/ethical implications.What these defamation laws illustrate is the astonishing regard many Asiatic countries have regarding reputation and face. It's not that crimes like murder are unimportant; it's just that crimes like murder are apparently culturally less important than maintaining reputation and face. So important is reputation and face in South Korea that these cultural notions have been codified into civil and criminal law. Philosophizing about the right and wrong of this in this context of cultural imperatives is a meaningless activity since right and wrong are cultural constructs. Watching such behavior unfold from an observation point of a culture where such behavior would be considered appalling and into a culture where it's considered perfectly reasonable is definitely a new experience. If you're one of those people who obsessively values multiculturalism then you can't sit in judgment of this kind of cultural value. Valuing multiculturalism means valuing cultural perspectives like this, too. You have no moral justification for picking and choosing.While the South Korean ""Genovese syndrome"" representation presented in THE WITNESS may have the same underlying moral message (you should value a victim's life and you should just eat the potential consequences to you personally), it's a bit more strained that it would be here in the West.THE WITNESS is a good movie, well-made and well-acted with good production values. Additionally, it offers a unique perspective on the whole Genovese syndrome issue that Western viewers might never have considered. An interesting watch. I recommend it."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"This film is just a marvel for my virginious search for good south korean movies. its a murder and a witness. harrison ford did something similar in a blockbuster, but this is even more convoluted than that. the first 10 minutes were just raw, near bestiallic in its grueling performance.the filmography are extremely good, and so are the editing, and use of lightsettings,to boost the shivering terror of the deeds done. the score are well made and smittens over on you like a virus.i still dont understand the korean language, complete kauderwelsh to me, but the actors are brilliant and very well spoken, so they would for sure dress the grumpy old man with invisible silk verbally so have a shot on this one, good action thriller!"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"If there was ever a character that I wished would be murdered it is the main protagonist of this movie. Along with many of the other tenants. Gutless, spineless simpering coward. OMG how I wanted him to die.This movie really made me uncomfortable. How can people be like this? Sadly this actually probably reflects reality more than our average heroic Hollywood movie."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"It is easy to say what one would do. Like if you and Hitler were alone in a room and no repercussions to be followed no matter what you do. In this case, let's say you witness something (hence the title), what would you do? There is a right thing to do and I understand if some people may feel no sympathy for the main character. But if you indulge and accept that flaw, you will see quite a suspensful movie, that works on many levels.Because apart from a thriller, it is also a social commentary. It is what most people are probably doing and what effect this can have on others. It's not easy doing the right thing, it takes courage. Of course as mentioned not just the main character is flawed, but also the movie itself. But while it is not perfect it is entertaining and might be able to give you food for thought too"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"The Witness is an excellent South Korean psychological thriller. The story revolves around a man who kidnaps a young woman who manages to escape but gets beaten to death in front of a modern apartment complex. A young family father witnesses the incident but is seen by the psychopath and feels too scared to intervene. He keeps the burden of that terrible secret for days and is often close to crack but realizes that the psychopath is stalking him and menacing his wife and daughter. A woman who saw the murderer on the night of the killing and a mentally challenged adult who is strolling the area are soon getting murdered as well. Our helpless protagonist must decide whether he should remain silent and protect his family or tell the truth and confront the psychopath.This movie includes lots of bleak social criticism and especially the final scenes are brutally revealing in that regard. It's easy to point fingers and criticize the protagonist for failing to inform the police about what he saw but the way people around him react make his motives easier to understand and even evoke some empathy. The shocking truth is that some people care more about the reputation of an apartment complex than about a human life.The Witness doesn't only offer food for thought but is really suspenseful from start to finish. The silent but pitiless antagonist is the most dangerous psychopath since I Saw the Devil almost a decade earlier. The way the antagonist stalks, observes and menaces his victims is absolutely haunting.The acting performances are credible, diversified and fascinating. The audience cares about every character involved for one reason or another.While the beginnig of the movie is a creepy psychological thriller, the second half quickens up the pace, increases the body count and features tough action sequences. If you like conservative whodunits, this movie isn't for you. You need a solid mind and stomach to fully digest this masterpiece.Anyone who is looking for an intense psychological thriller meandering between realistic drama and horror elements can't get around this overlooked masterpiece however. This movie is the greatest of its type in many years."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"I'm not saying that ""Mok-gyeok-ja"" (""The Witness"") is a must-see, but it does does tick off a few boxes that makes it worthwhile. Suspenseful? Check. Twists? Check? Deliciously violent? Check. Good acting and cinematography? Check. What are it's weak points? Mainly character development. The lead guy, the father, is the most spineless, ball-less coward under the sun, but at the end, suddenly grows a pair so large his gonads are the size of basketballs. Completely implausible. The filmmakers tried but the development was just uneven. Still, given the very nice ending, I do recommended this film."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"The movie is well made technically but the characters are acting in unrealistic, unrelatable and implausible ways from beginning to end. Maybe if you can suspend disbelief you'll be able to enjoy it, but unfortunately I couldn't."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,I loved this movie. The acting is flawless and the storyline gripping from beginnng to end. It even has a very important message at the end about helping each other when something is not right. Would totally recommend
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Another South Korean movie doing very well in the suspense, arresting you, distressing you, you feel like your own witness, afraid, between your role as protective father and husband or doing the right thing morally, which in this case is more than being brave, it can also be suicidal ... Lindooooo clash, everything in a light, relaxed, fun and witty way ... I love the oriental humor, with these huge doses of anguish, persecution, it gave despair ... Interesting ending, I had the same doubt... Wonderful..."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,This is not the best thriller/suspense movie i have ever seen but it is pretty decent. The man playing the witness did an excellent job potraying the anxiety filled feelings and emotions of a witness. The movie had a few flaws here and there but overall it is a good movie to watch although it goes on a relatively slower pace.
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,A Korean movie filled with cringe is a rarest.You became a prime witness to a murder. What will you do then? Obiviously you DON'T REPORT TO POLICE. At least that's what the lead in this movie does. Eventhough it's justified a bit... So its a little okayish. The killer who's now trageting all the witnesses murders one infront of the lead. So what he does again? Another oblivious non cooperation with the police. Duhhh..... The killer is killing one of the witnesses and the lead still believes in that guy. The best part of the movie is killer trying to kill the female lead and her kid and at one point she was able to hammer his leg almost breaking his leg. Now what would she do? OBIVIOUSLY drop the hammer near the killer and try to runaway. Simply fantastic.
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Was going to give this a 7 but the very last scene was so poignant & really got to me so I gave an extra point.The lack of response by the apartment residents to the cries for help, the unwillingness of the witnesses to come forward, & the inability of the police to guarantee protection to those witnesses that do come forward, are all realistically depicted.To digress briefly there was a similar occurrence (sans murder) in my building where my elderly neighbour was yelling for help from her balcony as she had locked herself out. Luckily my mum heard & asked me to check it out & I ended up ringing emergency services. Only after the firies came did much of our neighbours start coming out of their apartments to say they thought they heard someone yelling for help & asking if they could offer any help.Getting back to the film, I thought the pace was great with never a dull moment, & the final scene of the witness standing where one of the victims had succumbed & yelling for help at the unresponsive buildings packs a punch."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"A killer who isn't shy to kill in public places. The film took a while to warm up to, but it got pretty good eventually. The killer was cool as with most Korean thrillers. The protagonist really grinded my gears at times, just a total wimp and honestly should be locked away for accomplice to murder. Worth a one time watch."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Another superb serial killer thriller from South Korea. There's a strong whiff of Hitchcock about the plot which sees an ordinary man, no hero, a coward even, who witnesses a murder and then finds himself pursued by a serial killer. The background offers plentiful social commentary, particulary on the obsession with property prices and the lack of neighbourly spirit in the modern world, but the focus is always on the suspense and action of the main story. A committed cast work wonders and the fast-paced and constant twists and turns make this an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"A very boring film, very slow and acting was extremely sub-standard. very surprised because Korean films are usually pretty good. I suppose there's an exception to every rule and this one is it!"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,The protogonist saw a murder and that killer also saw him and warned him..later police investigate that murder and suspect the protogonist as a witness...Antogonist acted very well and screenplay also very fast...Some people say unbelieveable scenes but it gives more thrilling than ordinary scene..Must watchable movie..!!
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Such an suspenseful thriller, it kept me on my heels throughout the entire time.The story line slightly bores me out in the middle, but things sure took a crazy rollercoaster turn for the second half. It was very realistically filmed as it took place at a usual apartment complex in South Korea, gives you chills that anything could happen within a building.I wish that there was more back story about the murderer, as well as more script lines instead of appearing out of nowhere again and hit someone with a hammer. Action scenes were very intense towards the end when the witness fought with the murderer in the pouring storm inside the woods. Those two actors did amazing sacrificing their body and expending their energy rolling on the mud soil that the scene came out well.Definitely recommend this to anyone who wants thriller that satisfies your excitement. South Korea really does well on thrillers such as this one."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Thriller Movies from South Korea have often a Interesting concept/Idea however a interesting concept and Idea doesn't make a movie good. The Witness is one of these movies , It has a Interesting Story that sounds like mix between Psychothriller and Hitchcock, but the end result is disappointing , illogical and sometimes slow and boring. In the end it is a very generic Thriler/crime Story that thinks It is a very smart Film , the main actor is just mediocre and the villain is a very characterless and empty because we don't learn much about him. I can not recommend this Film , watch I Saw The Devil or Oldboy Instead."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Excellent pace, building horror and suspense throughout. You ask yourself 'what would you do' in this situation?Some real tense clever directing and building up moments that are on par with Hitchcock movies."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,Awesome movie - Worth watch - Dont Miss - Was engaged throughout - Amazing background score which couldn't be witnessed in other korean movies - Climax was good as well as Sad - This movie makes sense as always - No non-sense scenes in between - The frames which were really the need of the hour were only included.
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"A good Saturday night thriller, packed by great acting and haunting plot. Not a native Korean thus I saw using subtitles.. A fast pace movie and really entertains as the plot unfolds.. many scenes bring in real fear which one can come across in daily life. In a nutshell the movie describe a man who gets selfish to protect his family but later fight for the cause. All in all The Witness will keep you entertaining if you like Thrills... Go for it !!!"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Don't listen to the overall rating of 6.5 the movie deserves so much more.The movies is brutally thrilling and captivating, at the same time playing a psychological mind game. I was at the edge of my seat until the end. Throughout the movie there were several small plot twists.10/10 can recommend."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"Well, The Witness disappointed me on a lot of levels. At first I was intrigued by the premise of the story, but just a little bit into the film I slapped my head already half a dozen times watching this pathetic excuse of a protagonist constantly taking the wrong decision and thereby hurting a lot pf people. It was really excruciating as there was no real reason for his behaviour other than a hard to understand sense of pride / irrational fear of things that wouldn't happen in the first time when he just did one action right. Well, after two thirds or something he finally manages to do the right thing once and - guess what? - now every other important character acts unbelievable dumb and incompetent from now on. After a lot of horrendous scriptwriting, the ending is just the top of the cake. The perp has an insane amount of luck with what he manages to get away with.The only positive thing is the cinematography, but I had a hell of a time watching this without wanting to throw the remote at the screen every few minutes in disgust of the bad characterization.Ultimately disappointing."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,It started off very gripping but the amount of stupid decisions just became too much to bare that I didn't even care who died. It was a shame because the storyline was so interesting.
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"For me with most movies set in another country it's as much the way of life and locations as the movie itself that entertains .This is a good Thriller that is definitely worth a watch it's more 7.5 as a score . The cast is great , it's very well shot . Recommended ."
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"All protagonist was a total a**holes specially those stupid policemen and the main protagonist...this was supposed to be a good movie, but the stupidity of the main cast was totally got me...😕😕😕"
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,SIMPLY ITS A MUST WATCH BEFORE YOU DIE ONE OF THE BEST HIDDEN GEM BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FROM ME IF YOU LIKE KOREAN THRILLERS THEN ITS A TREAT FOR YOU ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE.......
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,The movie was supposed to be good until all non sense came! Such a waste of time! KILLER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND A BUSY NEIGHBORHOOD??? THE POLICE ALREADY KNEW THAT THE KILLER WAS AFTER HIS FAMILY AND THEY DID NOTHING?! THE KILLER ONLY USED A HAMMER AND NO ONE HELPS??? A HAMMER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT? WITH LOTS OF PEOPLE? REALLY?!
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,It kept me tho whole time at the border of the coach. A lot of suspense and action with a great message at the end.
我是证人,The Witness (2018),,2018,2015.10.30,"This was my first South Korean movie, so I can't tell if an over dramatic storyline and acting is considered the norm but this was over-the-top bad. All characters had no introduction into the story and especially the murderer's motive was left unclear. The story itself has so many loopholes which turned the initial thriller into a comedy film. To top it all of, the producers decided to finalize this mess of a movie with the poorest CGI they could find from the 80s."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"This year's Chinese New Year is packed with Festive Films, from Monkey King 2, Vegas to Macau 3 to Mermaid.After watching all 3 of them, I have decided to only write a review for Mermaid because it is the only one worth the effort and time.The great thing about Mermaid is that while it is a comedy that brings the whole family together, it manages to bring in an underlying plot that teaches us important values about ecosystem and a life lesson about money and materialism.While not on par with Chow's masterpiece like Kung Fu Hustle or Shaolin Soccer, Mermaid is better than Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. The slapstick style of comedy of Chow is evident throughout the movie, and the laughter by the audiences can be heard echoing throughout the cinema halls.A number memorable scenes provide some of the biggest laughs – such as when Shan made numerous botched attempts to assassinate Liu Xuan with various means and weapons from the sea.Newcomer Jelly Lin is the latest in a long line of ""Stephen's Girls"". Chow has the knack of discovering an illustrious list of talented actresses that include Karen Mok, Cecilia Cheung, and Vicky Zhao. Lin is the latest muse to channel Chow's range of rubber-faced physical comedy and deadpan delivery of killer lines. Jelly Lin is reportedly cast from auditions with over 10,000 hopefuls.While this film will not play extremely well with critics, it undoubtedly will have a good word-of-mouth as it is an entertaining movie with the right balance of humour, touching moments and good acting.After watching so many movies is this Chinese New Year, I can say that Mermaid is easily the best movie of them all.I look forward to Stephen Chow's next movie, and the opportunity for him to step in-front of the camera once more."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The Mermaid feels like a mix of random elements. I'll start off with the good; I did laugh at some parts. This movie is selling itself to be a Comedy through some advertisements and I believe the script handles the comedic actions well. Also the cast ensemble helped pull some of the funny aspects in the film as well. The first 2/3 of the film could be enjoyed merely as a Comedy; just something to have fun with and nothing really to over criticize or to over examine to the point of scrutiny. The last 1/3 is where this movie messes up; I mean really messes up. From comedy this film turned towards a very dark direction; showing the effects of us humans to nature as well as environmental issues, the film is even bold enough to exhibit real life footage of animals dying and being slaughtered and destruction of sea habitat. There's a lot of violence and blood, all the comedic atmosphere present in the first 2/3 suddenly wiped off and the result becoming a serious, imminent warning. Here's the thing; I don't mind dark elements being mixed in with humor. But the way it's done here makes us ponder what this film, in the end as an entirety, really wants to be because the way the light and dark are meshed in together here isn't done very well honestly. It felt random and the addition of the CGI (which I personally believe was poor) didn't help the serious undertone of the film trying to promote the protection of animal life and their ecosystem. Instead it made the film look goofy.So there's a romance in this film regarding the main character and the mermaid. First, it looked completely unrealistic since the chemistry came absolutely out of nowhere with the 2 characters dating all of a sudden (plus the random marriage proposal some days after they met). And in the end, the main character decided to help ""save the environmental life"" by donating all of his money and from destroying it he suddenly changed character to wanting to preserve it. The reason behind this was just because of his undying love for the mermaid which is part of that environmental life; I find that preposterous. There can be a lot of other reasons this film could tell us in its message on why to stop destroying ecosystems that can sound far more convincing and realistic instead of some stupid romance that has no chemistry or any of the sort.I'll commend this film for some of the humor it showed in the first 2/3 and how it tried to show environmental issues, but in the end, The Mermaid felt like wasted potential since the mix of the serious drama and the comedy didn't really work well. It felt unorthodox and wholly unrealistic especially when we look at how it portrayed several elements throughout."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"In this environmental activist comedy from Stephen Chow, mermaids whose environment is being destroyed by an evil developer plot to kill him, using a pretty mermaid as bait. The complications are unsurprising.While lacking any comical martial arts, the movie still has Chow's usual slapstick humor and weirdness. This includes a very funny scene of a series of hapless assassination attempts, a goofy singing duet, and a cool special-effects driven scene involving splashing water into objects. Some scenes are a bit too dumb, but overall this is a reasonably amusing movie, although nowhere near as funny as Chow's masterpiece, Shaolin Soccer.The plotting doesn't make much sense. The developer unconvincingly shifts from fairly cartoony awfulness to general sincerity, and the mermaids are, weirdly, more concerned with vengeance than with fixing their problems. But within its silly, slapsticky world, this isn't a huge problem.What is a huge problem is the shift into violence towards the end. It's both upsetting and nonsensical; a classic example of a movie that makes its villains evil to the point where they do terrible things that not only don't benefit them, but that would seemingly work against their interests. This whole part of the movie is pretty terrible, and to some extent ruined it for me.One last note. I had a dual audio version of this, and started off watching the English dub. I'm not someone who automatically rejects dubbed movies, but I strongly suggest that you do not, under any circumstances, watch the English dub of this, because it is horrendously bad. I think it's a shame that a successful director's biggest hit of all time doesn't rate competent English actors. If I were rating this based on the dub, I would take another star off. It's an embarrassment."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"I started to like Stephen Chow's movies since Shaolin Soccer. In order to maximise my enjoyment, I go for this movie without reading any reviews, especially from those who are always quick to write a review like a book. Anyway, I can trust that a Stephen Chow movie needs no reviews and quality is guaranteed. So being impressed with the poster, I set my hopes high. In order not to spoil anyone's fun, I will not describe the story or details. Generally, one can see that Stephen Chow's aim in this movie is to smash all China's box office and he did it successfully, with some good messages as usual; about love, humanity and environmentally friendly here, filled with romance, comedy, action and even a good old song. What else do you need for a movie to sell well ? Nothing else. For China audience who have not seen too much of Stephen Chow and where people do not have too high demand on artistic values, they are sure to enjoy it very much. For me, I don't like this style of ""mo-lei-tao"" comedy and I find them too much here. Much of the jokes are also old and predictable, although done in a good way. The male and 2 female leads are good. Most of the other supporting casts are poor. The 2nd male lead just cannot act and his face just don't match the role. Using that great classic HK song from the 80s is obviously to please the Chinese but made the movie less creative. This movie don't deserve any awards unless they give it for the same reasons like Titanic. Overall, I find this movie not as good as his last 4 because it doesn't give me much surprises."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Nice movie, better than I expected. The film's main message is about saving the environment. Scenes can be quite disturbing as they show real life footage of marine animals like dolphins being caught, sea birds covered in oil and the attack on the merpeople... There was lots of comedic moments throughout the film as expected. Special effects were obviously not as realistic as Hollywood films. Movie storyline started off light-hearted then gradually become grim. Shows how greed can destroy our world. Last few scenes made me cry. Love the way they portrayed the relationship between the mermaid and the guy. 7/10 stars. Several inappropriate scenes not suitable for children."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"""Mermaid,"" a science fiction comedy directed by Stephen Chow, tells a modern fairy tale with adult jokes and restricted blood scenes while never losing the genius comedian's charm.It is the story of a playboy businessman (Deng Chao) who falls in love with a mermaid (Lin Yun) who had been sent to assassinate him. The plot line seems to be a mix of ""Lust, Caution,"" an erotic espionage thriller directed by Ang Lee and ""The Cove,"" a 2009 documentary film directed by Louie Psihoyos.It also has an environmental protection theme, as Chow gets the mermaid to declare, ""if there's no clean water to drink and no clean air to breathe, what can you do with all this useless money?"" It reflects Chow's ambition and vision to tackle an issue of global concern. Actually, he used the same words when he attended the annual local session of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Guangdong.Deng Chao, notorious for his previous low-rated and flatulent comedy performance, benefits well from Chow's direction. This should remind people of his great acting skills and even earned him a Best Actor Award at the Shanghai International Film Festival in 2015.Lin Yun, as a new actress, also flourishes under Chow's guidance. However, as she proclaimed in a dialogue line at one point in the film, ""I'm not a professional actress, I can't do it,"" she still has a long way to go.The comedy partly comes from the weird, ugly and distinct supporting actors cast by Chow, as he has done before. Taiwan singer Show Lo, who plays an ""octopus mermaid"", is some kind of incarnation of Chow, evoking most laughter from the audiences.Though the director does not take part in any of the acting, it's obvious he has clearly taught every cast member, no matter whether they are leading actors or supporting ones, to act like him and follow his vision. In many behind-the-scenes clips, Chow actually acts until cast members can mimic him.""Mermaid"" also has some dark and cruel scenes that are not appropriate for children to watch, and the special effects are far from stunning and satisfying. Chow even used many classic Chinese music compositions that have appeared in his classic movies before, such as ""Daring General"" to put the seal on the film with his own characteristics.It is no wonder some critics called the film a mere repetition of old and clichéd tricks and offering no groundbreaking progress in his artistic evolvement. However, this is still the Chow many have loved.The film has a simple and strong message to deliver: Love can transcend race and other barriers. You could hardly expect to see such a pure fairy tale and such a clean theme in blockbusters for a long time, but Chow has done it with a pure and childlike heart. He seeks to the complicated into the simple, trying hard to make it beautiful and understandable.==============* My review is also selected and published on China.org.cn."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"This is from one of the renowned filmmaker from China, Stephen Chow. The film holds the numerous records, including the highest grossing Chinese film of all time. So anybody would be curious enough to check it out. This is highly inspired by the western fairytale 'The Little Mermaid', but totally a Chinese. It carries a strong message about the marine life and pollution, especially that coming from China is obviously not usual. A great theme for a Mandarin film to get exposed to the International stage. An appreciable effort with the decent graphics, but it's filled with lots of negatives than leaving a good impression on the viewers.The story is very important for a film and this is a very simple and short, but the remaining is packed with the comedies and stunt sequences. The film opens with the introduction of a multi- billionaire Xuan, who unveils his new sonar project on the coast Green Gulf where marine creatures consider it as a paradise. On the other side the shrunken to a very few, the merpeople plot to kill him. So they send their finest young mermaid, Shan to seduce him, but instead it creates a chaos when she falls in love with him. The final standoff between the man and merfolks set to reveal who will be the victorious at the end and the fate of Green Gulf.If you are a die-hard fan of Stephen Chow, be prepared for a big disappointment. He's out of his comfort zone here. Thankfully, he did not star in this crap. His strength are comedy and martial arts, but this film was none of them. I mean it is categorised as a comedy, but those parts were too sensitive to call them jokes. You won't be laughing much because of the killing, hurting, tortures, kind of upsetting events draws us away from enjoying it. So if you think it is a cute mermaid love story aimed for children just like CJ7 and if you allow them to watch it, you might regret it later.""Love has no law. It is beyond any rules and boundaries.""I don't know what is the rating for the domestic release, but this is definitely an R. It is certainly for adults and not everybody going like it. Looks like a film made for the local market only despite the influence of the western fairytale. It might have done well in Chinese box office, but the rest of the world does not consider it Mr. Chow's one of the best works. I think he should stay away from such project in the future, instead make a sequel for CJ7 or for the 'Kung Fu Hustle' where his fans are very eager for the official announcement.If you had seen all his film, especially the directed ones, then you might enjoy some of the jokes from this which is his trademark. The romance was underdeveloped and then the event followed by it that brings the grand finale was too violence. That is when this fantasy-comedy turns an action-thriller without a forewarning. I was shocked for such kind of transformation in the story. I wanted to like it, but could not because I expected something like a Disney film, but it was more like a semi Tarantino film.The addition of a cecaelian character was good from the comedy perspective. But just one from its kind makes him the last survivor and have sympathy than as he's the centre of the comedy in the narration. The overall story as well as all the main characters were never established to its full potential. I'm disappointed with the writing, the director is known for genuine screenplay, but he terribly failed to please his international fans. Of all, I only hope there won't be a follow up to it because we want the old Stephen Chow. He's better than this and I'm sure he will come strong. I can't recommend this film for children or the families, the youngster who are not very sensitive might be the right audience.4/10"
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"This may not be a Stephen Chow masterpiece.It is not because this is a bad movie, it is simply because Stephen Chow has set a very high standard in classic like Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin soccer.Comparing to what is available in the cinemas since beginning of the year, this movie fares well. Complicated movie like Hateful 8 may be critic's favorite, but this movie does what a movie fundamentally should do, that is to entertain its audience.Stephen Chow prove yet again a good director needs just to able to tell his story well, to make a good movie.His visual sense is driven, not by a need to appear artistic and confusing, but to resonate with audiences.The result, a well made movie that is entertaining and a simple story told well by a gifted film maker.Chow has a gift for spotting talent and using them well.Not only he is brave in casting a newcomer to lead role.He is able to spot the that Deng Chao (better know as the Running Man) will be perfect as a comic male lead.He is likable, even when he is acting like a greedy spoil rich brat. He certainly oozes charisma.Under Chow's direction, he is able to master the act of comic timing and delivery. Best scene has to be the ""failed assassination scene"" where the interplay between Jelly (mermaid) and Deng Chao result in a stomach ripping experience for the audience.I used to think his wife (Sun Li) is the only credible actress in his family, after watching Deng's performance here, I am convinced he is more than a Running Man."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Stephen Chow is one of my favorite directors in China, I have seen many wonderful films directed by him like KongFu Hustle, ShaoLin soccer. An outstanding characteristic of Chow's film is tricking of comedy ( I don't know how to describe that style accurately). However, this film, The Mermaid, is very different compared to the other two mentioned above. To conclude it in a sentence, that is a wonderful mixture of comedy, love, science fiction and environment. Environmental protection is heavy point of this film, but unlike many other directors, Stephen Chow shows it in another way, which is love and comedy.This film inherit many characteristics in Chow's old films, like 'XiaoQiang' and 'WangCai' and so on. Though Language comedy has intrinsically regional difference, many tricks can be conveyed from the simple actuation. Stunts seem to be an fatal drawback of Chinese films, may be investment is the major problem. But stunts in this film is very nice, e.g. the tail of octopus and arresting of the mermaid under water.Overall, this is a wonderful movie which will catch heart of a very general range of audience. I strongly recommend it."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Mei Ren YuThe Mermaid is written and directed by Steven Chow. I was unaware that going into this movie. To be honest I knew nothing about this movie other than the English title and that it was a Chinese film. You might recognize Steven Chow's earlier work: Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer. I'm beginning to understand why this movie made half a billion US dollars.The store is about a group of near humans who want the business that is endangering their homeland to go away. Sound familiar? It's the same premise as Avatar and Furn Gully. Once you get past that it's much different, tonally. This is a goofy comedy that hits it's mark sometimes and on others is just bizarre.Lin Yun plays Shan the young, innocent and beautiful mermaid. She's obviously new to acting and her role seemed to be perfect for her. Unknowing of the outside world and how to handle luxury. She wasn't believable in scenes that didn't involve her innocence.Chao Deng plays Liu Xuan a wealthy beyond means businessman who endangers the merfolk. He was the best actor in the entire movie and when you look at this track record in China it's not a surprise that he could draw a crowd to see the film.Show Luo plays the Octopus-man in the film is and is by far the funniest part of the film. Since it's easier for mermaids to hide among the humans it proves funny and near impossible to hide the fact he's a huge octopus on his lower half. The direction of the film is well done and I had been meaning to look up who had directed it since the start of the film. Good direction can make up for some bad acting by supporting characters. Much of the dialogue seems to be lost in translation. I felt that some of the funny parts must be colloquial or maybe my sense of humor is too strict. Verdict: Watch if you enjoy foreign films or Steven Chow. The first act is really slow and some of the supporting actors are off. The humor is either really goofy or clever."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The film is a romantic comedy. Lui Xuan is a real estate developer. He has sonars around his island, ""The Green Gulf"" to keep away protected species so he can develop it. Unbeknownst to him, it has trapped and is killing off the local indigenous mermaid (and men too) population. Shan has been assigned to lure Mr. Lui so she/they can assassinate him. Lui courts her as this turns into an odd Chinese version of Romeo and Juliet involving two different species. Shakespeare sells.The film has English subtitles. The comedy was good. It made me laugh out loud. The police scene was a riot. The sound track fit neatly into the film using mostly stuff we hear in American and old European films. The opening scenes of a side show scam artist sets the comedy mood. The film also has action. It hits on all cylinders.Guide: Quick male butt showing. Implied topless scene. Use of SOB and frequent ""bitch."" A large tentacle is where manhood should be. Shooting and killing. Even the music has subtitles."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The Mermaid is excellent.This movie is very funny and has a serious, exciting and entertaining story with interesting characters.The mix of comedy drama fantasy and romantic goes perfectly together. Quote: ""Just imagine, there would be no clean water and no fresh air on this earth. What sense is there then to have so much money?"".Perfect movie."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Stephen Chow is known for his consummate ability to pay homage AND lampoon his cinematic influences to a degree which exploitation film ""auteurs"" like Quentin Tarantino can only dream of.And since moving his movie productions to mainland China in the 22nd century-- beginning with Shaolin Soccer(2001) --Stephen Chow has been earning new fans and losing old ones as he increased his presence behind the camera and broadened the range of his film subjects, all the while showing up all the lame Chinese directors and scriptwriters still using mainland Chinese censorship as an excuse for their inability to tell a coherent story with a meaningful message for more mature audiences.But now, after Stephen Chow has paid homage to and parodied the horrors of ""The Shining(1980)"" with ""Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons(2013)"", he has even gone so far as to pay homage and parody the ecological documentary ""The Cove(2009)"" in a mainstream romantic-comedy and urban fantasy using a modern Chinese setting.Structurally speaking, ""The Mermaid(2016)"" is basically ""Lust, Caution(2007)"" + ""The Cove(2009)"" (fans of Disney or Han Kristian Andersen, please see yourselves out)-- but tonally it remains a Stephen Chow slapstick-comedy and social farce, complete with a no-surprise ""tacked-on"" ending.So this is one of Stephen Chow's more ""indie"" projects, like ""CJ7(2008)"", where the ""big moments"" are few and far between-- but therein lies his genius: the movie sails by so smoothly that Chinese audiences did not even realize that the last Chinese legends about folks who were half-human and half-fish were recorded in the ""Mountains And Seas Classic"" over 2000 years ago... cos the scene-stealing Grandmistress Mermaid (appearing to strains of traditional Chinese music) could not have appeared anywhere else but in a Stephen Chow movie (made/set in mainland China).The only real criticisms that can be made about this movie are the ones that were also leveled at ""Monkey King: Hero is Back(2015)"" last year: it's too short, too simple, and it's production values too mediocre (for a ""blockbuster"" movie)-- but why do you think audiences left theaters wanting more (story/character)? Stephen Chow ""gets it"" that movies are not really about how much effects work/ world-building or how many twists/ ideas you can stuff in them, but just how much you need to do so that the audiences ""get it"".Personally, I am glad that Stephen Chow gave up on the Hong Kong/ International market and is just making movies that he has a genuine interest in-- cos when a mermaid/ merman asks in genuine confusion/ frustration: ""what's the point if there's not a drop of clean water left?"" or ""who gave you the right to destroy our homes?""... I realized I've just been preached to in the most ""natural"" way possible.Recommended for those who have heard of, but are too ""cool"", too ""chicken"", or too ""clever"" to watch ""The Cove(2009)"""
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Ruthless land developer Liu Xuan is planning reclamation project for Green Gulf. He's using powerful sonar to drive away dolphins. He takes on Ruolan as his business partner. The playboy Liu Xuan calls up cheap floozy Shan after being ridiculed by Ruolan. Only they don't know that Shan is actually a mermaid. She is part of a community being driven out by Xuan's sonar. Shan is told by Brother Octopus to assassinate Xuan. After many failed attempts, Shan wins over Xuan with rotisserie chicken. Shan is conflicted about killing him but a conflict is inevitable.This is Stephen Chow's very broad brand of comedy. The museum mermaid is hilarious. There are some funny bits with Shan. There are lots of funny with a good helping of environmentalism. However, there are some uncomfortable violence especially the climatic battle. Chow is obviously heavily influenced by documentaries such as The Cove. It's awkward to have such vicious violence trying to coexist with the broad cartoon comedy. There is a difference between cartoon violence and brutal horror violence. He needs to cut down on the horrifying."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Still you could say that the humor may still strike a nerve with young ones. Most of the humor that is. If you don't know the director by now, you will have a template of his style and comedy after watching this. If you do know him, you know what to expect. And while it does have quite some flaws, it still was a lot of fun.So it may feel weird to be entertained to the level you are entertained, especially because some of the jokes are really set low (some even below water ...), they still hit their marks mostly. It has to do with timing and good execution (this time no pun intended). Good fight scenes, but also predictable story. The charm lies elsewhere ..."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,I laughed probably once every hour which is not very much given this film is only around two hours long. I don't understand how they managed to pull all that money from Chinese film goers. Did they give them all free bottle of beer before they watched the show.I think you probably had to be drunk to really enjoy this film.I understand the Chinese cultural slapstick comic nature of the film however I though they tried way too hard to be funny. Chinese comedies do not do subtle humour.The characters in the film are totally ridiculous(but really that's just Chinese comedy in general). The relationships that form between the cast are nonsense. Its just a craptastic adventure.
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Over all, I liked this movie.I rarely watch Chinese movie. I actually watched this one because of its box office.The movie is definitely a good comedy. You will laugh a lot and sometimes it will be difficult to stop! Specially the scene in the police station.But the special effect & visual graphics is very weak what will annoy you. Not to mention the underwater scene(s).Story is not that deep but you cant complain because its a comedy movie.But you will definitely be entertained."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,What happened with Stephen Chow? This is his worst movie I've seen. Bad CGI & stupid romance! And not even funny at all unlike Shaolin soccer or Kung Fu hustle! Dissapointed!
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Which is not a bad thing. ""The Mermaid"" is a very funny movie that showcases all the strengths and weaknesses of Chow's movies: it is funny, it has lots of slapstick, it is way overacted, has lots of cameos, it is has problems of pace (from frantic to coughing and sputtering), it has a plot as thin as an atom. And its CGI is subpar.The story is simple: The mermaids (and all the fish) are being killed by a sonar that has been put in the sea by supermillionare Xuan. Xuan is your typical new rich that believes everything can be solved by throwing money into someone's face. Lead by half-man half-octopus... Octopus and the oldest surviving mermaid, the mermaids decide to put a plan in motion: they will send Shan to seduce Xuan and kill him. Cue lots of slapstick, sillier and sillier moments, amazing overacting, and a tongue-in-cheek tone that makes the movie highly enjoyable for all its running time.Chow is not going to change now, so for someone who has not enjoyed his previous movies, ""The Mermaid"" will probably not change his mind. The plot is non-existent, just an excuse for the silliness, and at the beginning the movie has problems with pace. However, with so much enthusiasm and love for its style, it overcomes its shortcomings and ends being lots of fun. With a little bit of a side dish message about the environment and the importance of relationships and love instead of money."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"""Mei ren yu (Mermaid)"" (2016 release from China; 94 min.) brings the story of Liu Xuan, a real estate developer. As the movie opens, he wins a bidding war at an auction for the Green Gulf conservation area. He plans on converting it into a development of some sort. Meanwhile, we learn that an old ship wreck on Green Gulf is the place where a bunch of mermaids live. They decide Mr. Liu needs to be eliminated, and send their cutest looking girl mermaid, Shan, as the honey trap. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is directed by well-known Chinese actor Stephen Chow. Here he brings an all-too obvious story line that provides some laughs at times, but for me the movie is simply too ""politically correct"" (too much money: bad! hurting the environment: bad! etc.). Thankfully the chemistry between the two leads (Chao Deng as Liu Xuan and Yun Lin as Shan) is palpable and that helps a lot. The first hour of the movie is heavy on the rom-com, while the last half hour is bigger on the action scenes. I rate the movie 6/10 because I feel it's an okay but nowhere near a 'great' movie, as seen from my (American) perspective.In case you hadn't heard yet, ""Mermaid"" is the all-time highest grossing movie in China. The movie opened this weekend on a single screen here in Cincinnati, and I was curious to check it out, to see what the hoopla was all about. The Saturday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (better than I had expected). I was the inly non-Chinese/Chinese-American in the theater I might add. There were some jokes and scenes that were well received by everyone besides me, making me think that there were quite a few 'inside' jokes that simple went over my head as a non-Chinese. ""Mermaid"" is worth checking out for the cultural phenomenon that it has become in China."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.So here's the story. An estate project involving reclamation of the sea threatens the livelihood of the mermaids who rely on the sea to survive. So they dispatch one of their own to seduce and kill the project manager. The director here is Stephen Chow, who has also acted in many films. His more popular directorial efforts include Shaolin Soccer (2001) and Kung Fu Hustle (2004), but two of my personal favorites are From Bejing With Love (1993) and Journey To the West: Conquering the Demons (2013). If you're familiar with his work, you will know what to expect with Mermaid. He gives us a charmingly wacky, high energy film that moves at a brisk pace from start to finish. There are tons of jokes that are consistently peppered at the viewer; some work better than others, but it helps to keep the viewer engaged throughout.The premise itself also allows for some unorthodox character interaction, which is especially entertaining. How many comedy movies concern a nutty mermaid who is attempting to seduce and assassinate someone? I always like it when a movie is a bit different, and this one certainly is. Like some of Chow's other films, there are some rather serious and violent moments that are introduced, but they work well despite resulting in some tonal shifts. The reason I feel this way is because this film makes its lead characters likable and you don't want to see them get physically harmed. So that's a positive.The lead actress here is Yun Lin, who is a newcomer, but she dominates the proceedings with a very expressionistic performance. When she shows up for the first time, her make-up is all messed up and she's practically screaming her lines. You're saying to yourself, ""Is this the lead actress?"" Acting like this can get extremely annoying, but I have to say that she nails it very well. To give a performance this energetic and yet still be funny and likable is quite an accomplishment. She was definitely good in this. The lead actor (Chao Deng) is also very good. He plays off of Yun Lin properly and they have good chemistry together. Finally, I have to point out that the supporting actress (Kitty Zhang) could very well be the most beautiful woman on the planet. My goodness! The first time I saw her was in the very romantic comedy ""All About Women"" (2008) and really liked her performance in that one. She's just as good in Mermaid. At one point during the later half, she gets quite serious and she's entirely convincing. I do not want this woman getting angry with me.With all of that said, however, I would not elevate Mermaid into quite the same class as the previously mentioned movies from Stephen Chow's filmography. But at the same time, I'm not exactly sure why I feel that way. Maybe it's the environmental theme and characters, which are basic and not particularly nuanced. So in some sense these qualities limit the overall depth of the film.Also, the special effects are low grade and cartoonish. There's a lot of mermaid and tentacle stuff going on, which is not particularly convincing from a visual standpoint. This flaw is limited to being a minor distraction due to the light overall tone. For some reason, I easily forgive lackluster special effects in comedy films. And to be perfectly honest, I think moviegoers place way too much emphasis on special effects nowadays. If the film itself is immersive, low-grade special effects can be perfectly fine. Clash of the Titans (1981) is a great example of that. I love that movie.Regardless, I definitely enjoyed Mermaid, and it could very well move up my ratings list after a second viewing. If it plays in a cinema in your area, check it out. It is not yet available on DVD, but there is a good chance at a wide release given the popularity of the director."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"One of the most visible traits from Stephen Chow is his lead female is always quirky and far from generic beauty, thus the mermaid here is definitely not your average princess. The style of mixing comedy and drama is incredibly and bizarrely compelling, often depicting light nuance and then jarring grim tone hand-in-hand. However, it works perfectly for the drama as well as delivering its eco-friendly message with approachable means.Liu Xuan (Chao Deng) is a businessman who ruins environment for profit, little did he know that a group of mermaid is hell bent on stopping him. It's a rather simple build up, although the simplicity is strikingly presentable. This is a love story that is littered with silly antics in expense of its own characters. It's nicely done without being too cheesy and having good female lead Yun Lin as Shan who is adorably unlike supermodel can be uniquely charming.The comedy is spot-on, as expected from Stephen Chow. His signature stupid series of unfortunate events are ridiculously infectious and effective in delivering laughter. Those wanting classic slapstick from Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle will not be disappointed. Its transition from comedy to drama and even slight horror can be jarring, but no one does it better than Stephen Chow. The mixed tone plays smoothly, sometimes having sad and funny moments at the same scene.Unfortunately, it's not without flaws. Its usage of CGI can be sketchy, Chinese film has a certain juvenile style of CG, which might fit some movies theme, but here it is often poorly done. Still, the movie plays its nature premise pretty well, using it as subplot and also an integral part of the movie.The unique fairy tale is attractive in its own way, with slapstick humor and oddly riveting drama."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The first star: environmental protection is the theme of the film. We lack of the idea of love for wild animals, how to live with wild animals in harmony is a difficult problem for all of us. It is worthy to explore the relationship between human and nature through comedy form. Unfortunately, the film only convey the idea a little bit, did not cause audiences think deeply about this idea. In other words, the theme of this film lack of depth. The second star for all the efforts at director Stephen chow, but I have to say that many skills he used in the film is out of date. All stuffs he tried to make me laugh is also very low, which let me feel he is repeating his wits, but poor, no new ideas. For example, in order to cater to Chinese audiences' nostalgia on Hong Kong TV series, he used a piece of original music from the 1980s, but the music can only lead us excited for few seconds. In general, the script is very poor, unless you are a first time to watch Chow's movies, otherwise, you won't have any surprises. In other words, we may expect for Stephen Chow too high. Fortunately, former works directed by him are very good such as ""Kung fu"" is my favorite. The third star for cast. Chao Deng is working very hard. The supporting actress Yuqi Zhang is very sexy. She is the best clothing model in the film. But the overall actors' perform level is amateur. ""Kung fu"" is my first time to see director Chow's work. Up to now in retrospect, many aspects of ""Kung fu"", such as special effects and actors' perform can make up for the inadequacy of the screenplay. Besides, all amateur actors in this film is very good coordination with professional actors, they can complement for each other and show characters is also very bright, which give us a lot of surprise. In comparison in this movie, amateur actors perform as if to take home video, there is also nothing special brilliant acting given by professional actors. More frightening is Yuqi Zhang's tone color, as if her throat covered with a layer of Kraft paper. When she read her lines screaming, I always feel suffocated."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The highest grossing Chinese film of all time is an absolute bonkers of a cinema that nicely blends the elements of comedy, fantasy & romance into one utterly ridiculous, batshit crazy & delightfully entertaining feature while also packing in surprising level of heart & a thought-provoking message concerning our environment.The Mermaid tells the story of a money-minded businessman who purchases a wildlife reserve for a sea reclamation project, and uses his sonar technology to get rid of the region's aquatic life. The plot follows a young & beautiful mermaid who's dispatched by her folks to kill him but both of them end up falling in love with each other.Co-written, co-produced & directed by Stephen Chow (best known for Shaolin Soccer & Kung Fu Hustle), The Mermaid has all the craziness of his previous works, be it absurd moments of hilarity, idiosyncratic characters or corny CGI effects which further enhance the oddities of his flicks. The laughs are plentiful yet after a while, it runs out of fuel.It does make a statement against environmental pollution in its own wicked manner although what actually surprised me was the tragic turn the plot takes in the second half, which was unexpected but still a welcome move, for it gives the story a sense of direction while showcasing that beneath its farcical surface lies a rich, thoughtful & somewhat sensible tale.The cast does a capable job of illustrating its whimsical characters, and the chemistry between the two leads only gets better as the story progresses. Camera-work is energetic, always trying to keep up with its maniacal moments. Editing does let its comical aspects fetch a tad too far. Visual effects is cartoonish as mentioned before, while the background score fails to heighten the emotions & is incompatible for the most part.On an overall scale, The Mermaid is another whacky entry from Stephen Chow that promises loads of laughter but everyone won't be able to get on board with its eccentricity, for few will find it quite annoying while others will enjoy it for the same reason. It does work as a comedy, is touching as a romance & is overly fanciful at times yet Stephen Chow's latest would've been more rewarding if it had settled for a more balanced narrative."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Playboy business tycoon Liu Xuan (刘轩, played by Deng Chao) purchases the Green Gulf, a wildlife reserve, for a sea reclamation project, and uses sonar technology to get rid of the sea life in the area. Unknown to him, the Green Gulf is the home of merpeople, and the sonar has caused many of them to die or get sick. The few survivors live in an abandoned shipwreck in the gulf, and want to assassinate Xuan for his deeds. The merfolk send Shan (珊, played by Lin Yun), a beautiful mermaid who's trained to walk on her fins and hide among humans, in a ""honeytrap"" plot against Xuan. On the night of Xuan's party celebrating his success, Shan, pretending to be a dancer, gives her telephone number to Xuan.Xuan, thinking that Shan is a prostitute, calls her number in order to make his business partner jealous. Shan goes to Xuan and tries to kill him but her attempts keep backfiring. In the end, Xuan decides to send Shan back home, and along the way Shan takes him to a funfair that she works at. While there, Shan tries to show Xuan there are more important things than money, and Xuan is impressed with Shan's simple, funny antics. They spend the day together and develop feelings for each other. When Xuan finally takes Shan home, Shan quickly sends Xuan away before her people can kill him. The next day, Xuan takes Shan for another date and proposes, but Shan rejects him.That night, Xuan goes to Shan's house to talk to her, and discovers the truth that she and her family are merpeople. Against Shan's wishes, the others capture Xuan and tell him how he's killing them with his development project. Xuan is about to be killed when Shan helps him escape. Xuan returns home and, after the shock has worn off, decides to investigate the effects of his project. He turns off the sonar but mistakenly tells his business partner that Shan is a mermaid and where the other merpeople live. The merpeople are attacked, and many of them are killed. Xuan arrives in time to save Shan before she's killed, and sends her back into the ocean so she can escape.Three years later, a student arrives at Xuan's home to thank him for setting up a scholarship for research into environmental protection. The student asks Xuan whether merpeople are real and the story that he fell in love with a mermaid is true, but Xuan denies it. Xuan then introduces the student to his wife ""Lucy"", who is actually Shan."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"My wife and I wanted to see this because of the high IMDb rating and also because there is a large Asian population in our town due to the local state university. Frankly, we were also curious if the Asian kids would be as disrespectful of their own ethnic movie as they are of ours. Very often they will use their smart phones during top movies of all kinds and it's been appalling to us. It's hard to believe they're unaware of how badly that makes them look but much easier to believe they don't care.Well, we weren't disappointed, most of the audience was Asian, as expected, as it's in Chinese with subtitles, and some did use their cell phones during the movie. I suppose it could be we don't get the top notch kids, but the university insists they are.Anyway, the movie itself dragged in the beginning, but started to pick up about a third of the way through. It finishes strong and pleasantly. The early parts revolve around a feckless rich and unattractive playboy who is in the habit of getting what he wants. And what he wants besides prostitutes is to develop an island and make a lot more money. In order to have his project pass muster, he scares away the (apparently protected) dolphins living there with constantly playing loud sounds.It turns out there are more than dolphins in the area, and, in fact, there are genuine mermaids who have long stayed out of sight. The story concerns one of them played by Jelly Lin, I think it was, who is sent to kill the playboy because his sonar is causing huge damage to the marine life including the mermaids themselves. This is good as the more the mermaids and an octopus get screen time the better the film becomes. Jelly Lin makes for a delightful focus who doesn't mind getting into some broad humor. It eventually all becomes a rollicking, almost slapstick comedy folded into a surprisingly touching love story. The effects aren't quite as good as in Shaolin Soccer, but they're tolerable and occasionally very effective. The message is clearly and honorably pro-environment in the end. Too bad the violence gives the movie an R rating because Asia does not enjoy a good reputation for conservation as the dolphin, whale and rhinoceros killing has, to my knowledge, hardly abated, despite numerous complaints. And what could be better than to have their kids watch someone like Stephen Chow, the director, promote conservation?"
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"'THE MERMAID': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A Chinese sci-fi/comedy fantasy romance; co-written, co-produced and directed by Stephen Chow. It tells the story of an extremely wealthy playboy, who falls in love with a mermaid that's sent to kill him. The movie stars Chao Deng, Yun Lin, Yuqi Zhang and Luo Show. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's became the highest-grossing Chinese film ever made! I found it to be just a little too strange, I like strange but I didn't like parts of this (for whatever reason), but I still enjoyed it (mostly). Liu Xuan (Deng) is a very rich playboy businessman, that purchases a wildlife reserve for a sea reclamation project. His company then uses new sonar technology to get rid of all of the sea life there. What Liu doesn't know is that the area is inhabited by merepeople, and his sonar technology has killed many of them (and caused the others to get really sick). The surviving merepeople want to kill Xuan because of this, and they send a beautiful mermaid, named Shan (Lin), to assassinate him. The two then start to fall in love instead. The movie is obviously very different than Disney's 'THE LITTLE MERMAID'; Hans Christian Anderson's original fairy tale was the main inspiration for both films though. It's violent, at times very dark, and R-rated (I think it's probably considered a family film in China though). It's also very bizarre, and weird. I respect those things a lot; but not if I don't actually like what they create (like a lot of the weird slapstick comedy in this). I do like the movie overall though, and I respect it's originality and awesome creativity.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/bryytrjyDdI"
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"I growing up watching Stephen's movies. This might be one of my top three favourite movies from him.Personally I have enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Not a dull moment to me (A bonus if you are a Chinese viewer as there are tons of hilarious one liners). Well, if you don't understand Chinese and were reading the subtitles whilst watching this movie, you might not get all the jokes. There are a lot of reasons why this movie is breaking records everywhere in the mainland and Chinese speaking cities. I think the most important reason behind the success of this movie is the meaning behind this comedy/fantasy film. Yes the visual effects might be totally silly to some but the environmental messages behind this movie is immense. If you have no idea about the infamous annual practice of Japanese whale/dolphin killing in a cove near Taijii, Japan, I strongly encourage viewers to watch that documentary before viewing The Mermaid. Watching this movie is like a roller coaster ride to me. The first 90% of the movie were filled with tears of laughers, whereas the last 10% portion of the movie were filled with tears of angst, heartache and despair. P.S. I rarely give 10/10 these day simply because nowadays all the blockbuster Hollywood movies were simply rubbish and without any meaning behind all those cliché plots/special effects. Considering this massive comeback of Stephen coupled with an important message, this is definitely a movie worth multiple viewings.P.P.S. A lot of heartfelt bloody scenes of ""fish"" killing/slashing, not suitable for children. But expect more from the documentary The Cove (2009)."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The Mermaid is something completely unexpected; incredibly funny for moments with some very violent scenes and a clear message about damage being caused to nature and the world; to satisfy the greed of a few.The story is simple; a clumsy mermaid disguised as a normal woman; tries to seduce a greedy tycoon who is killing marine life where she and her community lived. She falls in love with the guy (and he with her) and tries to protect it. However thinks get more complicated (and violent) when people find out about the mermaids community.As usually happens; foreign movies; particularly the successful ones; are punished by the MPAA with a ridiculous ""R"" rating that basically kills younger viewers and of course the movie itself.The movie has some violent scenes; particularly ones showing people killing whales, dolphins and some mermaids. There are some depicting of mermaids burnt by the powerful sonar systems using to ""study"" marine life but those scenes are meant to show the human cruelty.There are other goofy violent scenes; but are playing basically for fun.This is an Stephen Chow movie (the guy that created Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer among others. This is in my opinion his best movie. Very fast paced; funny and cruel when it has to be.In brief; see it and recommend it. It is time to star seeing good movies instead of crap like Avengers (or the last X-MEN) that basically take over all USA cinemas."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"It's so bizarre and exaggeratedly comical (at least it tries to be) it could turn out to be good, for someone, I couldn't win, I lost interest in the opening minutes, I didn't get it back, and I let it roll at random..."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"From the man who brought us such favorites as Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer comes The Mermaid.It's a story about a billionaire who can do anything and has everything, thanks to his cash. Becomes a target of an assassination attempt by a group of mermaids whose home he has been destroying. Making matters more interesting the billionaire falls in love with his would be assassin who harbors the same feelings.It's a funny comedy that you would expect from Stephen Chow filled with hilarious slap stick gags and outrageous physical feats down for comedy effect.The main characters were fun and interesting to look at but I did find the supporting acts not as funny and a little bit of a waste.I have to admit it's not his funniest comedy, and there comes a point where the film gets really dark in it's message on how humans are destroying the environment, but otherwise humorous."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,The movie is about a love story between a human and a mermaid set up in modern day China. In terms of review the concept of the story is good but could've been executed little better. As far as acting is concerned lead characters are great specially Deng Chao as an arrogant businessman. Zhang Yuki is impressive in negative characters. Show lo is very impressive and surprisingly good. Lin Yun as mermaid wasn't much convincing and could've been better. Direction and screenplay is good. Location is ok. Movie is entertaining but still you will feel something missing. Overall a good entertaining movie
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Not sure why the low score but I guess I give extra to movies that are creative, funny, full of action, great cinematography, and have a great ending. So glad we purchased the bluray we will definitely watch this annually. Great for the whole family it even has a great message."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The whole film can only be rated well, and there is a strong sense of irrelevance. The length of the film is too short, there should be many transitions, some abrupt before and after."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The mermaid is a Chinese sci-fi fantasy comedy.The movie is produced and directed by Stephen Chow. The movie got his brand of humour. It is a bit silly.There is the human and mermaid love story. There is also a marine conservation /environment protection message behind the movie.Basically it is about a rich playboy tycoon Xuan played by Deng Chao who has bought over a piece of land and try to reclaim land from the sea, he must first drive out the dolphins and other marine wildlife by sonar power. These angered the mermaids which send one of them Shan (played by Lin Yun) to seduce n to kill him. They gradually fell in love. This angered Xuan's ex and business partner Ruolan (played by Zhang Yuqi).There is little chemistry between the leads. Zhang Yuqi is sexy compared to Lin Yun. The movie also starred Show Luo."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,This film was to short in length. I didn't covered romance part well. I think romance between them didn't develop between them and the climax comes. Its to early to fall in love specially when you are play boy. It was very hard to digest that he quiet his ways so easily. Comedy was not so comic. I didn't like the pairing was odd. She looked like a kid in front of him.
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"When you know who is director you will know this movie gonna be laughable. Like Stephen Chow always do, don't expect the ""GIRL"" is normal and normally will be happy ending.Fun is how they keep humiliate Lin Yun in the movie, like small eyes, baby fat etc etc. May be that is the way you protect your artiest been attack by public after the movie been release. Cause as you know Chinese people jealousy are damn high.By the way, this movie proved Show Luo not just can sing well and dance well, he also can act well in comedy movie.About the plot, you may have some old story. A guy meet a girl, thought that girl must be same like other girl. However is not, he fall in love in her but doesn't know she was try to kill him and BLA BLA BLA.Talking about CG, it do look terrible in trailer. However it was acceptable in movie theater, not too bad. Just don't compare the CG in Hollywood. Anyway the background setup in the ship scene is excellent.For me the laughable joke is when Lin Yun try to kill Chao Deng, having roasted chicken and singing the classical Cantonese song. Lastly is Show Luo legs been cut off for cooking or by Lin Yun.The last 20 min in the movie was take my breath away, all the ship chasing, hunting, shooting, magical fish tail attack, escaping was marvelous. Is a great movie and should go theater watch it."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"I appreciate the movie's attempt to stress on environment protection. Yuqi Zhang is very beautiful. Deng Chao made an effort to pull of a comedy.The story is weak and does not make sense. There is not much material with a lot of cliche moments. The next moments are very predictable. The jokes are not too funny, although tried fairly hard. There is not much acting either. Overall meh."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Some sequences in this flick will leave you in stitches. Chow is here at his finest, mixing comedy with lots of heart and an ecological message. Reminded me of the best of Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. Movie takes a dark turn but makes a point."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"'Mermaid,' the new offering from director Stephen Chow is a breezy fantasy romantic comedy in which a group of mer-people (the sub-titles only refer to them as ""Mermaids,"" even though some are clearly men) decide the only way to save their lives is to assassinate the mega-tycoon behind the exploitation and destruction of their undersea home. They teach one of their young, erm, school-members, how to walk like a human (sort of) in order to turn her into a honey-pot trap for the tycoon, and the plot is off and running. This movie features some hilarious slapstick comedy as you would expect from this director, some beautiful visuals, sets and locations, and not an especially subtle pro-conservation/anti-whaling message. However, it's still fun enough that you don't feel you are being preached at the whole time, at least."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Firstly, why do all Chinese movie romances have the guy yelling angrily, ""I love you!"" like it's a bad thing? They make me think that Chinese culture promotes the man being stoic and then loses his mind every once in a while while the girl is usually non-serious and goofy. I've never found the chemistry between Chinese leads to indicate a simmering romantic heat and I can't help but conclude that Chinese are a bit prudish. They try to make romance too innocent and childish and when they have a kissing scene it seemed awkward. Not hot.In addition to a lame romance, Stephen Chow tries to use his slap stick physical comedy but most gags were not even remotely funny. Major physical elements didn't work at all. e.g., the rich dude trying to explain to the two cops his encounter with the mermaids. Also, the tentacled dude getting his tentacles cooked at the chef's stand didn't work either. The girl playing the mermaid love interest had a few chuckle worthy parts where she was singing. What is up with all the insults she has to deal with from everyone though? She just laughs and agrees? Weird.I liked Kung Fu Hustle a lot but this was not even close to that film which to me is like the Chinese Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I give ""The Mermaid"" 5/10... +1 for the environmental message... 6/10."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Probably this is not a masterpiece of Stephen Chow's but I liked this plot. It is a simple movie . But genius Stephen Chow proved his talent by making it an excellent . Of course it was not as funny as Shaolin Soccer but it holds an excellent message which touched my heart . Only Chow can do send message through comedy . This movie made me laugh , made me sad and made me amazed . The legend Stephen Chow narrated the whole story in his own way and I admired it . If it was not Stephen Chow the whole movie would feel simply boring . But Chow showed his talent . Hat's off Chow. You are the best ."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"I hardly write reviews and I was never a Stephan Chow fan even when I was growing up in Asia. But this film impressed me a lot, especially when I was very disappointed with the quality of many Chinese films in the last few years. The Chinese films now have more budget, but a lot of them have no soul. And sadly, some Chinese directors who I used to admire are now making rubbish.This film is very refreshing. It is rare to find a film that is funny, well made, but at the same time makes you reflect on the environmental problem. It does not do it in a way that lectures you, but rather you came to that awareness among the laughter. That is very valuable, which is why I gave it a 10!"
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"Stunning cinematography and a cool story. Nothing really mind-blowing as far as the story and characters go, nice to see a different take."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"The following lines (also theme song) from the movie pretty much sums it up nicely:Being invincible is so so lonely. Being invincible is so so empty. When I'm alone at the peak, cold wind constantly blows. My loneliness - who can understand?Stephen Chow is referring to himself and the unmatched box office success of the movie. He is invincible, and so is the movie. And it is lonely at the top..."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"If you're watching this on Amazon, note that there is no English dub track (which is probably a good thing), but unlike another user I read the subtitles flow okay without timing issues. I wished whoever did the subtitles would have toned down the sexist language here, maybe instead b--ch they could have just said ""crazy woman"" or something?Anyway, this is a typical Stephen Chow movie -- which means it can be very funny with loopy, oddball characters and performances -- and often nice unguarded moments when Chow lets the actors be dumb, real human beings. Still, his movies lately are very uneven. As another reviewer pointed out, the movie gets violent towards the end and you wonder maybe he could have conveyed ""threat"" in a different way. Although I love Chow's style and humor, I just wonder who the audience really is for this movie? It seems like certain concessions were made to produce it -- you wish that it could keep 1 tone and stick with it."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,I felt extremely touched watching this movie. The humanities in this movie are really good
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"It was through random circumstance that i even found this film but i am so glad i did, without knowing much of anything about it i sat and watched what is definitely a gem of a film for anyone who likes their fantasy with a good bit of comedy, and after finding out the director is Stephen Chow it makes even more sense as perhaps one of my fave films of all time is Kung Fu Hustle and this film has that same kind of quirky humor that makes Chows films brilliant!I will admit things move...a little bit janky at times and suddenly it can be full speed ahead but for me personally it just makes me with this had been a series instead, as it also left me wanting to know more about Chows world of mermaids..in particular it made me REALLY wish there was more about the elder Mermaids past.The wacky comedy mixed with a honest serious message makes it a great film that akin to the story it gains its inspiration from will only get better with age, then again these kinds of film are my bread and butter so i may be a little biased.It doesn't kick Kung Foo Hustle off the top of my movie list but it's definitely one i will remember and recommend to others!"
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"I very like to see thisSome argue that Stephen uses a lots of old jokes and routines in this movie that makes it a little bit weak on the script. However, I think it's one of his best. He doesn't make as many dirty jokes as usual, but you can really learn his philosophy through this two-hours movie and have a very good laugh at the same time."
美人鱼,The Mermaid (2016),,2016,2016.02.19,"It gave me laughs throughout the film from star to finish. Mixing opulence, disney elements, gags, over the top magic and romance between a tycoon man enriched the story. Less tragic compared to classic disney films like Lion King the death of mufasa (but is another story)one of the few comedies that fulfill my expextations to the top."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"It's a mystery to me why Wolf Warrior became one of the most successful cinematic franchises in the People's Republic of China.The acting performances are cringe-worthy at times and especially lead actor Wu Jing has stiff body language yet overacts whenever he expresses himself verbally which makes for an unbalanced contrast. The special effects look as if they had been made by a company specialized on video games in the mid-nineties and the movie constantly exposes these flaws. The two worst offenders are the bullet fired in slow-motion in the beginning of the movie that had me laughing out loud and the pack of wolves that doesn't even look remotely close to real wolves. The story is also forgettable and unimaginative. The locations are equally bland and mostly limited to some exchangeable fields and forests. The movie also includes an unhealthy dose of Chinese propaganda but that often comes along with military action films.Still, after a weak start, the movie still manages to end up being solid. The action scenes are intense and will keep the audience on the edge of its seat towards the end. The lead character who can be described as a resilient non-conformist with a soft core is easy to empathize with and his tough but tender female sidekick is also sympathetic. The film doesn't overstay its welcone with a concise length around ninety minutes which can be considered a strength these days.In the end, fans of military action movies can give this solid average film a try and will get exactly what they can expect. The movie is comparable to franchises like Rambo and might sit well with a larger audience. In the end, the movie however fails to be innovative enough to stand out. Before revisting this film, I would rathet watch some old Chuck Norris movies again. These film have more charm and less fake animations."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Leng Feng is a harden super-sniper in the Chinese Army. His unit takes down a drug operation. He disobeys orders to kill the gang-leader. He is reprimanded and is assigned to the special unit Wolf. Meanwhile somewhere southeast Asia, police tries to take down ruthless drug-lord Min Deng, the dead gang-leader's older brother. He coldly has his western mercenaries massacre the police and sends them to avenge his brother.This is a Chinese military action thriller. It's a lot of action. Some of it is solid but it's rarely realism. They are literally fighting a pack of wolves at one point. Compared to Hollywood, the effects are slightly inferior. There is an impressive amount of real military hardware. It's better than most B-action movies but not quite at the theatrical level. Way too often, the soldiers are standing too close to each other. I guess it conveys something visually but it looks cheesy bad. Overall, I give the action a good passing grade.The leading guy is hard which could be interpreted as stiff but that's the character. He takes some comedic turns which are quite jarring. The evil plot is questionable at best. It needs to be better written. It should be a simple revenge plot and not that hard to figure out. The good aspect is that the western mercenaries are formidable foes. There is also a cheesy battle over motivations. All of it adds up to a nice fight against tough villains. There is a fine B-movie here but a few stumbles keep it from being good."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"A fervid display of Chinese nationalism & jingoistic propaganda, Wolf Warrior treads the same route that countless Hollywood action war blockbusters have walked, and packs some expertly choreographed moments of action as well. However, the story has no meat on it, its characters are dull, the CGI is lame, and the pacing is tedious throughout.Co-written & directed by Wu Jing who also stars as the lead, the film establishes its tone rather well with its stylishly photographed opening segment, and also makes it abundantly clear who its intended audience are. But once it tries to build a narrative around its primary character, the shortcomings in the script are effortlessly exposed and turns this 90 mins story into a chore.Not a single character is worth caring about which keeps us detached to everything that unfolds on screen. The action picks up in the second half but it is predictable & uninteresting. Wu brings a physicality to his role that helps keep things afloat but its nationalistic sentiments are overplayed. Scott Adkins plays the baddie and does his usual shtick. And that romance angle is an absolute cringe.Overall, Wolf Warrior is a bland, boring & blatant propaganda piece that attempts to remind its citizens of their duty & responsibility to their nation but the execution is all over the place. There are a couple intense & captivating scenes of martial arts face-offs where it redeems itself to an extent yet for the most part, the picture remains an unexciting & unstimulating affair. A forgettable, lifeless & uninspiring actioner."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I personally enjoyed this movie a lot. It's rapid-paced, intense and quite entertaining. I've also read that some of the action sequences are actually coming from real Chinese special force members who invented them and put them in use in reality. It's also a milestone in Chinese movie genres. Chinese movie is famous for action genres but this one is the first hybrid of genres of action and military. And it's not tradition Chinese martial arts which is mainly for the purpose of performance and exercise, not practical combat. The actions in this movie are a reflection of, but a little glorified, modern military combat. However, I'd say the directing is the biggest weakness of the movie. It's understandable, because the main protagonist directed the movie himself. He admitted in an interview that he really didn't want to direct the movie because he was not a professional director. He was just an martial arts actor. But he spent a lot time and efforts trying to find some professional directors to direct this movie and investors to invest but in vain because no one thinks this genre would be popular. He had to do everything by himself and invest in the movie out of his own pocket. So the movie took 7 years to make. It turned out to be great success at the Chinese box office. If there were professional people helping him refine the plot as well as directing the movie from the beginning, this movie could've been a lot better. Given all these reasons, I gave it an 8 out of 10. On a side note, by looking at some of the reviews here, I am amazed by how many people have ridiculous double standards. When it comes to a Chinese military movie, it is just Chinese propaganda so it's lame, untrustworthy and worthless. But when it is Black hawk down or American Sniper or any American patriot movies, it heroic, righteous and meaningful even if the movie is about a western country engaging in a war that causes many civilians to die on other nation's soil. In contrary, China, no matter how bad it is portrayed in western movies, it never incurs any war in other countries. Chinese army is built to protect its people from invaders, not to invade. It's funny that how many westerners are brainwashed by their biased media and ""propaganda"". The world is big and every story has two sides. People should get out of their home and take a look at the outside world. Only by this way can a person form a more objective, mature outlook of things, especially when it comes to political affairs. I believe I am entitled to say this because I myself has 10+ yrs living experiences in both China and USA and I know how media are manipulated and twisted in both countries. Now I don't fully trust either source solely. Rather, they complement each other pretty well to give you a quite clear picture about what is the truth about everything and how media only serve the interest of their own country, even though at the expense of sacrificing objectivity and authenticity."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"It wasn't too long ago I saw Donnie Yen's Kung Fu Jungle, which offered a triumphant display of frenetically paced, vicious fight sequences, that continuously delivered in originality and entertainment. To say China is renowned for delivering outstanding martial arts movies, would be an understatement – sadly though, Wolf Warrior, does not continue the tradition. Though the words 'breathtaking martial arts' appears on the top of the box I purchased, let me assure viewers of this statement's inaccuracy. It is unfortunate the fight sequences failed to convey anything original, however, the addendum that these scenes only comprise less than five minutes of the feature's entirety, only adds to the disappointment.Lead actor Wu Jing, who was involved in writing and directing this production, clearly sets himself up as an action hero, his character surviving a number of confrontations that would surely kill any ordinary human being. However, despite even this, the film seldom enthralls. A particularly entertaining scene sees Jing running from cover to cover, avoiding an enemy sniper's fire, however, even this moment is rather dull in contrast with how outstandingly tense it could have been.Leng Feng (Jing) is a brilliant sniper, whose reckless behavior, in order to save the lives of his fellow soldiers, results in his military career being called into question. Long Xiaoyun (the beautiful Yu Nan) sees Feng's potential, and recruits him into a secret Special Forces group – the War Wolves, a collection of some of China's most accomplished military personnel. During a training exercise however, the lives of all participants are plunged into jeopardy, when drug lord Min Deng (Dahong Ni), in his desperate attempt to avenge the loss of his brother during Feng's last mission, recruits Tom Cat (Scott Adkins), and his band of mercenaries, to kill all involved.Viewers will be quick to notice the antagonistic force, comprised of muscular militia, are all of Caucasian/European origin, while the protagonists are all Chinese. If anything, the film appears to advertise the strength and courage of Chinese forces, and it is here the film excels, much of the dialogue used in these sequences conveying empowering notions of patriotism, and despite the fact I am not Chinese, even I was impressed by how the Asian super power's military was spoken of. At the same time though, the film incidentally contradicts this with the sheer number of Chinese soldiers that fall like flies against the oppositional forces.The occasional heroic dialogue however is usurped by the often uninteresting conversations, a number of which are quips at the expense of Xiaoyun's character. A high-ranking female in the Chinese military who commands the War Wolves, you would imagine that she demands respect. Instead, she is the subject of many sexist lines from Feng, and other men, and rather than punishing their insubordinate behavior, she appears content with their unsatisfactory conduct.Despite the front cover of the film I purchased showing a man with a minigun, please don't be fooled into thinking, like I was, that this weapon will be used in a particularly exciting scene – believe me, it's not. Wolf Warrior has the ingredients of a great action film; however, the recipe goes disastrously wrong, the tension between Feng and Cat being very under-exaggerated, while the villains themselves, despite their bravado, prove to be nowhere near as threatening as an action fan may hope. Furthermore, the lack of depth and attention provided to many of the characters, especially the villains, prohibits the audience from connecting with them, and though the film strives to emotionally involve its viewers, these attempts feel forced and out of place.Jing and Adkins are clearly adept martial artists, and it would have been great to view them in a film where their talents are proficiently captured – sadly, this feature does not serve as the venue for such excitement. In short, Wolf Warrior has all the hype of an action film, but none of the flavor, and though the end hints at a sequel, we can only hope that if China decides to make a franchise here, the sequels prove to be immensely more entertaining."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"So let me rewrite that plot for you: A bad guy hires 10 super mercenaries to capture the soldier that killed his brother, during a raid on a drug factory. The mercenaries decided the best way to capture him was during a war exercise, where he is surrounded by 1000+ soldiers.And after writing that, i just realized, the plot is the best part of this movie."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Wolf Warrior is a Chinese military action romp with a dash of nationalistic fervor. This is a mostly very watchable action film. It has a strongly military flavour, with a discernible thread of Chinese nationalism, that reflects that nations emerging role as a military superpower. As such, its enjoyable but also a bit corny at times, as films that mix entertainment with nationalism and patriotism, tend to be. Wolf Warrior is well paced and chocked full of action. Its interesting to see the Chinese take on a military action flick. The cast is a mix of local talent and foreign actors who take on the role of the bad guys threatening China's boarders. All in all quite worthwhile if you can accept this film for what it is. Certainly its no better or worse than the nationalistic films cast in the same frame from other countries such as the US and UK. Seven out of ten from me."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"After learning about the humongous business the 2nd part of the movie is doing in China, I decided to watch the first part. And oh man, how boring was it!! Extremely poor acting, inconsistent story, actions which are neither believable nor fun made it a below average flick. Maybe the nationalistic viewpoint and the positive portrayal of the armed force made it a commercial success in China but the appeal ends there. The worst of all was the sexist tone of the movie. Dialogues like a woman cannot be the commander of elite troop or a soldier asking her out were definitely demeaning."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Although I like Scott Adkins, this film is unfortunately an utter nonsense not interesting on any level and looks more like a Chinese military propaganda action film. For those who like Scott Adkins and his martial arts craftsmanship, please stay away. There is like two minutes of fighting in the whole film and the rest is just shooting and even that is so unbelievably ridiculous that there is no point in watching this flick. Most of all, the wolf attack scene is so ludicrously digital like something taken from a Lorenzo Lamas movie. Adkins should play Boyka and not wasting his time and energy on stuff like this. My overall rating is 3 out of 10 and I really think I am being generous here."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Awful in a good way. Spoiler the main character gets shot in the heart (they never say heart, but the hole is next to his nipple towards the center of his body) Heart? With a 30.06 caliber rifle. Does not even faze him, nor do grenades, mines, knives anything really. This guy is a machine. This film is supposed to show off all Chinas great military hardware. But when everything they use was originally from, the U.S. or Great Britain or S. Africa, it winds up being a big 'up yours world we steal it all.' kind of feel. No military hardware in this film is not a copy. The acting bad, effects o.k.. The dubbing is so bad it is GREAT. The attitude for loss of life and a persons value in China is clear when, the lead asks the love interest if she has a boyfriend and everyone laughs in the C3 room, As dozens of Chinese soldiers are dying. Also women are treated as decoration. All in all, if you want to laugh see some cool stunts and see whites as villains this is for you. If you want a serious military action drama, skip it. If you want see three guys fight off about fifty cg wolves watch. This movie sucked in the good way."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Well the reason i tried to watch this movie was only because of Scott Adkins..but i guess you cannot make a movie work only with big names and script and logic also goes hand in hand. And latter was nowhere to be found in this movie.I apologize to any person if my words here offend any one but my review is only related to the movie, it has nothing to do with any one's belief about their country or society. so here it goes, The acting is nowhere to be found; many scenes in movie do not make any sense and it looks like the director had no clue about how to make a scene work when there is no action taking place. So foolish dialogues and weird logics keep coming up. I did not felt the emotion or intensity behind the voice so acting is not the forte of the main lead. so i thought it's fine because in most of the action packed Chinese movies people expect amazing stunts and that compensates the weak acting skills but such is not the case here.This movie does not delivers in terms of action as well..only the opening sniper shootout scene was bit creative but i kept hoping for more and realized this scene was the only attraction of the movie..and even the finale fight was not up to the mark..the fight scene looks plain and lacks innovative camera work that made Hong Kong movie industry famous and a recent example would be The Grandmaster (2013) if you know what i mean by that.The movie is like an instant noodle pack with great packaging but far away from being what it has been advertised as. The movie does not make sense at times and appears like story was written while filming the scenes (Pun Intended). I have seen many Chinese movies over the years and being a non Chinese i still found many flaws with this movie..and recommend to watch it on their own risk as any quality movie fan will not like this. This movie is not a good movie and it can be watched for one time only and would recommend to straight away skip to the climax as only there you will see Scott Adkins in action..rest of it from beginning till end is a pathetic experience.My rating 4.5/10. Some people may not agree with my review but this movie is also not average. so watch it on your risk because you have been warned."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I'm all for movies with gunfights and wouldn't be disappointed in an old Clint Eastwood for example to have him just shoot it out and not get involved in some good old martial arts. When you've got actors like Jing Wu and Scott Adkins however I'm watching the movie because I know these guys can bring epic fight scenes if they want. Sure they did a bit of hand to hand but it was almost a drop in the ocean relative to the whole movie. I also know that its a military movie but when has that stopped a good martial arts movie from being made just by throwing in some reason why they need to fight unarmed. Perhaps I'm being harsh I just feel that the martial arts potential of both actors was wasted considering how athletic they are. I wanted to see ""Boyka"" vs the ""Legendary Assassin"" not a generic blink and its over a few stars above a Bruce Willis fight."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"This movie tells the story of Leng Feng, a man struggling against the system and the corruption... Ah, who I am kidding! This movie is a sad excuse for showing that Chinese men (and in particular its army, and also the hero of the story, actor-director Jing Wu) are strong, capable of taking the lead, and all those things men are supposed to be and do. And it doesn't even do an acceptable job in convincing the viewer of its purpose. The action is lame, third-rate left-from-a-Steven-Seagal- movie scenes, with only a couple of jumps that would cut the mustard in a school play. The fights are risible, with zero tension or show of workmanship. And the dialogue and acting... better not get into that. It also best not to say anything about the kind-of-love-story, or what the bad guys are trying to steal (it being another reminder of the purpose of the movie).""Wolf Warrior"" is just bad. Plain and simple."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Story isn't bad, has a few funny parts. The actors are likable, and the action isn't half bad. It's directing isn't on par with any American stuff, but it's not going to chase anyone away either. It has some hilarious Chinese propaganda sprinkled throughout, all and all it's ok."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I have read other reviews on here and found they are fairly unfair but each to there own.This movie is full of action even though a bit over bearing in some of the action scenes where men are on the verge of crying for there comrades which isn't realistic, The story line is good and you have the typical goodies and the baddies. In all I found this movie entertaining even though it had undertones of Chinese propaganda I found it no different to the American propaganda that we generally see at the movies,I had to download the subs from a different site, but I found this movie well worth watching and recommend to others who like action movies to watch it.One area I did not understand was where the wolves come from and why, what was the reason they were there.? this is something to watch for as its all action, it left me rather confused.out of 10 I give this movie a(7/10)"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Watching this so-called Chinese Special Force crap is like getting the root canal dental treatment without anesthetic procedure. It's very painful to watch a film spent so many manpower and money for nothing. I often thought why most of all the mega-budget movie productions out of Asia, including China, Hong Kong, India and other Asian countries always turned out so lame and so childish shallow and pathetic. I think mostly it's because their screenplays sucked big time, the dialog sucked, the casting sucked, and worst of all, the directing sucked.Why after having borrowed so heavily from many foreign movies yet still turned out so lame? 1) Just like the stupid ""Strike Back"" TV series, a camera seemed to be always followed every movement of the characters from so many different angles for the control center to monitor so easily. It's just looked so unconvincingly stupid.2) In order to tone down a fully macho testosterone crappy movie, the stupid production would so stupid put one totally unnecessary, highly impossible female character in it. So in ""Blackhat"", we got a totally useless and purposeless heroine to play a very absurd unnecessary role. This ""Wolf Warriors"" is even worse, they put a woman with bee-stung lips to play as the leader of the so-called toughest of all toughest Chinese military forces. Give me a break, will you? 3) When you in the hot pursuit of the unseen enemy in the jungle, why a) everybody still holding their assault rifles in front of their eyes? How this stupid gun holding gesture would speed up their chasing speed? b) they never spread out but grouped so tightly together, making them such an big easy target and never got a chance to react? 4) Why once all of the Chinese military films would inject so much unconvincing patriotic slogans? 5) Why the stupid production team would be so stupid enough to add computerized wolf pack attack the so-called 'Wolf Warriors""? Where's the brotherhood, man? 6) Why all the cameo uniforms looked so new? 7) It's very tiresome to watch what we have seen in this movie, like the realistic Chinese military forces, endless trainings, rehearsals, would-be imaginary fighting, small or large scale; or even computerized strategic rehearsals are always and the only stuff that Chinese military forces are doing everyday. It's so formulaic and so painful to watch again and again.8) The soundtrack was over-the-top annoying and unnecessary most of the time.This is another self-indulgent, self-righteous, self-pompous...a B movie styled film trying so hard to glorify the Chinese Communist 'Liberation' Army."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Must admit it is simply a propaganda, and it's just for Chinese people. Not surprised to see such a low rate for this movie on IMDb while it is generally rated high on Chinese film reviewing websites. I AM disappointed to the poor story and CGI of this movie but I think it's already not only a movie for entertainment to most of the Chinese people. You probably have no idea what Chinese kids are like today in the country. Most of them set their life goal to move aboard, seems like our country is too weak to compare with other developed countries. Their heroes are Hollywood superheroes, and every time they hear something about our own country they only see the weakness and just laugh at it. This movie, I say, is to build up the faith, the self-confidence to our country. It is to show the kids that our country is much stronger than they imagine, and to show them that every time when they're in danger, it is the country that will protect them from it. As a 17-year-old Chinese kid myself I can strongly feel what I get from this movie. It probably is not a good MOVIE, but it has the power to move all the Chinese people. Go watch Wolf Worrior II. Much better than this one as it can at least be called a MOVIE."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"This may very well be several army rehearsal footages edited together and guest starring Scott Adkins for about ten minutes. It severely lacks plot and realistic cinematography, instead the movie resorts to outdated macho cliché and military gung-ho basically from start to finish. With Scott Adkins collaboration with Chinese production, one would expect visceral combat, but Wolf Warriors doesn't even deliver on that regard as well.Story is flimsy at best. The usual renegade cop is transferred to a special unit where he must stop a terrorist group. It's highly exaggerated and filled with 80s action movie gimmicks. The leads, both male and female look unrealistic. Not to mention there's a lot of goofy reactions that are meant to be intense but presented over zealously.It often depicts the entire command headquarters cheers like they are NASA from Armageddon or WWE crowd as the lead does something dramatic, or stop entire operation to mourn a soldier, even giving ceremony on the spot. I don't mind some patriotism element, but the approach is too heavy handed to be taken seriously. Screenplay is mostly soldiers marching, it doesn't fit the scene yet they just run around theatrically, brandishing guns and bullets excessively.Martial art fans will be disappointed too as it barely presents any fight scene. The best it can do is five minutes with Scott Adkins, and it's not even as good as his scenes on Undisputed series. Not to mention the movie tries to shoehorn CGI which looks incredibly stiff. There are a lot of shootouts, but they are mostly likely numbing than interesting.Beneath all the fireworks and loud macho gargle, Wolf Warriors is a bland military movie without thrill on action or plot."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"soo..im not good at English..but i really hate this movie.. just want to tell others DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP This Movie is total Chinese Military Propaganda.. not worth it.. The Actor was good tough...but not the script and effect CG Effect really cheap just watched it for like 10 minutes and i cant bear it to watch it any longer the first scene after that factory raid that is worst enough already but that river rescue scene that are really the worst.. i remember watched that kind of scene in Act Of Valor.. total Copy Cat ohh and the first scene there is somekind of iron man ""jarvis"" tech at the desk..of course with lowly cheap CG Effect"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,Wow... it's a world where the Chinese communist government are heroes and America's capitalist free market system is the enemy. The 1984-esque change of Chinese history has begun.
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Leng is a cocky sniper who disobeys a direct order and does some fancy snipering and takes out the leader of the smuggling group. For his efforts he gets thrown in jail, draws the attention of the smuggler's older and more successful crime boss brother, and gets recruited into the elite special forces detachment called the War Wolves. The crime boss hires a group of mercenaries led by Scott Adkins who plays an ex-US Navy Seal named Tomcat.The action set pieces are well choreographed but nothing overly impressive. The climax fight between Jing and Scott is decent but quite underwhelming, considering how much of a good fighters the two actors are, the sequence should have run a bit long. The film also features one scene with wolves, why? Because you know, there's ""wolf"" in the film's title. To make matters worse, they used a very cheap and silly-looking CGI to bring them to life, I could do without the sequence, truth be told. The in-your-face patriotism is quite annoying and melodramatic and could use some subtlety. The main character Leng seems a little invisible, during the forest sequence he was clearly shot (in the left chest) but this guy continues running as if the bullet gives him more adrenaline and why does he always sweats profusely? It feels like a good third of the running time of this film is spent doing close-ups of his sweaty face.All in all, Wolf warrior is an ok action flick with entertaining action and average story."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,To be honest even we Indians would make a good movie with half of the budget of this movie. Only reason I took this movie to watch just because sequel of this movie is biggest grosser in history of Chinese cinema.
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"It's also very patriotic and it has Scott Adkins in villain mode/role. The Chinese language is only interrupted when Adkins and his men are on screen, who talk in their native tongue of course. If you don't mind subtitles then in between all the action that is going on, than you will have an action packed movie, that knows its stuff.There is of course not a lot of acting going on and there is even time for a bit of romance on the side and in between all the mayhem that is going on. Wolf Warrior might not be what everyone dreamt becoming growing up, but it sure looks like a great ad for the Chinese army and some of the values it says it represents. If you get over that fact, there is enjoyment to be found here"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"What crap movie? ? ? Can China stop being self-righteous? ? ?Those movies that say China is strong just disappeared for me! ! !I beg China not to just think it is, okay? ? ?"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"The IQ of the film has fallen below the human bottom line, and some have even reached the point where they can't bear to look straight. For example, in the red and blue military exercise, hanging a green screen and then hitting a few keyboards can invade the enemy command system. Is this an information war in a science fiction movie? As for the wild wolves that appeared in groups at the scene of large-scale military exercises, did your military first clear the exercise venue? There are also so-called special forces in the special forces, crossing the river in rows and advancing side by side, so they are blown up by mines and mines. Can the marching distance in the jungle be so close! Please, you are special forces, don't you know how to maximize the combat capabilities of individual soldiers?"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"WOLF WARRIOR is another military-themed slice of Chinese propaganda designed to show off the Chinese special forces at their very best. They're on the trail of a team of international mercenaries operating at the Chinese border, but the plot is merely an excuse for lots of flag-waving propaganda and furious action sequences typically involving expert sniper Wu Jing battling the bad guys. Truth be told, this is a deeply flawed film with some ridiculous moments; the CGI wolf attack is the nadir of the whole thing and the first half, concerned with training, slow and confusing. It's nice to see Jing playing the good guy for a change and very good he is too, although I could have done without the endless romance with Nan Yu's extraneous character. The good news is that the woodland-based action in the second half is very fine indeed, as is the frenetic opening sequence, and it all builds up to an exhilarating fight climax with the one and only Scott Adkins playing the baddie."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I don't get the hate for this movie. Ridiculous people saying this is just ""Chinese propaganda"", etc - who cares?? Every year movies are made about the American military, patriotism, etc. Why can't the Chinese do the same?I went into this for Scott Adkins, and even though he's an unlikeable (although not nearly as unlikeable as in Triple Threat) side character and there were only two hand to hand combat scenes with him, I was not disappointed. There was pretty much non stop action, it was exciting, and even funny at times.The movie is not without its issues. There were some very obviously unrealistic things that I was baffled by. The way some characters of different ranks spoke to or interacted with each other was very far-fetched. There were times when I didn't really know what was going on or how we got to where we were. I was paying attention, so I don't think I missed it, I think there were just some holes in the script.I watch all of my movies and TV shows with subtitles, regardless of the language. This is the first time that I can remember where I struggled to follow the dialogue (I've seen a good bit of foreign films). I don't know if the issue was with Vudu or it's like that on blu-ray/DVD as well, but the subtitles were moving too fast and I kept having to rewind and re-read many parts, even multiple times. It was very frustrating.All in all, it's a very entertaining action movie, as long as you can not focus too much on the flaws and you keep your remote handy."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Good action + military movie.There is a lot of improvement to make, but this is a breakthrough for non-US made movie in this category.There are a lot of implications to China and other countries, but this is in most movies made by US.I personally love this movie, despite some political part of it.Generally the movie is very real and CG is up to standard of 2015, which is much better than most movies from China or other countries.When US makes it, it is not a propaganda. When other country makes it, it is."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"After seeing so many pro-American fighting forces movies, I was interested in seeing for a change a foreign movie that cheered on its own fighting forces, and the Chinese movie ""Wolf Warrior"" certainly did that. Seeing that the movie got the support of the Chinese government and military, it has a substantial amount of propaganda... though then again, so do Hollywood movies that get the support of the American military and government. But what about the entertainment portions of the movie? Well, it's kind of mixed. There is some decent action here and there, though it's mostly confined to the second half of the movie; the first half is kind of talky and could have used some more action. I do wish there was more martial art sequences, seeing that they cast the great B movie action star Scott Adkins as the chief mercenary. And while the movie never looks seriously cheap, it's obvious that the budget was not as lavish as a major Hollywood studio production. (The attack by a pack of wolves has some really crummy CGI, for one thing.) Personally I found the movie interesting enough, though I can understand the viewpoint of other IMDb commenters who didn't find it their cup of tea. This is one movie that you'll probably have to judge for yourself instead of relying on my opinion or anyone else's."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Part military action film, part government propaganda, Wolf Warrior shows what blockbuster films from China have become as they expand their film viewing audience. The story is about Leng Feng (Jing Wu), a skilled sharpshooter who uses his sniper skills to take down drug lords. He disobeys orders to kill the brother of a ruthless drug lord Min Deng (Dahong Ni). Despite his disregard for authority, he is invited to join the elite Wolf company. Min Deng swears vengeance on Leng Feng and escapes arrest with the help of his group of mercenaries lead by Tomcat (Scott Adkins). The wolves go on training with a large military activity that includes cyber warfare and advanced weapons showing off the might of the Chinese military as well as their intelligence with computer hacking.Coordinated by Long Xiayun (Nan Yu), the wolves are able to outshine their competitors and win the first practice fight. The drill becomes dangerous when an actual pack of wolves attacks the soldiers at night and they have to fight them off with live bullets and bayonets. On the next day, the drug lord's mercenaries strike and kill one of the wolves leaders who had a daughter. The mercenaries escape but not before showing off their advanced weapons that can take down a helicopter. The wolves get very patriotic as they load up from a weapons drop and head out to fight the mercenaries. They are ambushed and suffer more losses.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"...because those CGI wolves were really lame.Other than that, I've no complaints about this movie. It's a popcorn action flick about a one-man army, similar to many of those mindless Stallone and Schwarzenegger flicks. Not necessarily my type of movie, but it's one of those films you'd want to pop up on a lazy Friday night when you have friends over and are enjoying some pizza and cold beer.Note: Yes, this film has some China-nationalistic overtones, but it's no different from every other action flick that Hollywood likes to churn out. If your ""evil China-propaganda alert!!"" is being triggered by this movie, then you've obviously been brainwashed by one too many anti-China 'news' report and this movie is NOT intended for you."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,Most idiotic stupid movie that I've watch in my entire life.
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I like this line in the movie best. The place we are going to protect is desolate all the year round. Without this fight, we may not come here for the rest of our lives. There are no mountains and rivers, no gold and silver treasures, but in the eyes of our soldiers, this is the most beautiful place, because it is the border line of the people's Republic of China, which we must defend with life and blood"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"There have been many remarks on here about how this is a flag waving, pro-Chinese movie. Yes it is, but there is nothing wrong with that. I throughly enjoyed the movie. It was full of action, the story was engrossing and it did what it was supposed to do . . . entertain me.I see nothing wrong about another country taking pride in their military. Why is it okay for the Hollywood to put out crap like The Hurt Locker (and it won an Oscar???) but doesn't get criticized for being pro-American and bad reviews? Other US movies like Independence Day (a great movie), Captain America and American Sniper (I really enjoyed this one) are also flag waving.Highly recommend giving this movie a try."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Some of what is shown is what we actually do in U.S. Army Special Forces, I am surprised more people (Actors, Extras) did not get Seriously Injured, even doing ""Stunts"" as Stuntmen.During Vietnam, a U.S. Army Special Forces Team if pursued by Vietcong (V.C.) and North Vietnamese Army (N.V.A.), would do some of what was depicted, area denial weapons (anti personnel land mines), claymore mines, two hand grenades with the fuse cut to zero and the pin almost out and pins connected with thin fishing line ""trip wires"". The Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army learned the hard way not to pursue us, because what we normally did was as we were (Creedence Clearwater Revival Song) ""Run Thru the Jungle"" we create an L Shaped ambush for those in pursuit.The effectiveness of the U.S. Army's Semi Automatic Magazine fed M21 or M25 Sniper Rifle (a modified M14) is shown versus a bolt action sniper rifle, as to why we used the M21 or M25 instead of the short range M4 or M16 at both Afghanistan and Iraq (also Syria, Libya, Yemen). Snipers from Training do not stand up, prone or at the most kneeling only, the only time a Sniper stands up, is during urban warfare near but not at the window of a building (being at the window provides counter snipers a silhouette target).What we are trained to do regarding anti personnel ""landmines"" is, dig around the landmine, slide a tourniquet (or belt) under the landmine, loosen boot laces, buckle the tourniquet over the boot and the landmine, tighten the tourniquet, slowly remove foot from boot, tighten the tourniquet more as your toes leave the front of the boot. After you have your whole foot removed, tighten the tourniquet a few inch pounds more, then step away quickly. Just hope you don't step on another landmine close by (as how they are normally used, just feet away from the blast radius of the landmine you just got away from). Sometimes this does not work depending on the type and model of landmine, as many have ""anti tamper"" secondary triggers located underneath the landmine.That landmine that launched from out of the stream is a ""bounding"" landmine, previous versions were called a ""Bouncing Betty"".They had to have lots of cooperation of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Navy (P.L.A.N.) to show off their Military Capabilities and New (2015) and future weapons.Most people will automatically classify this movie as Chinese Propaganda, then tune themselves out. Without realizing that this kind of movie gives some insight into how and what Chinese are thinking and doing, as different from the U.S. and U.S. Allies."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Awesome Chinese action adventure thriller!! Brilliant production, effects, photography, acting and music.Action and excitement from beginning to end."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Most of the review here are calling this pro-Chinese propaganda. I however, would like to suggest that this is actually anti-Chinese, whatever the intensions of the writers were. Throughout this movie, the only people who are worse than the Chinese special forces are the Chinese mercenaries. The special forces, and the even more elite special forces walk into trap after trap, and are beaten very easily by the international mercenaries. The PLA looks completely incompetent, save for the main character, who just happens to be the director of the film. Whether he made the rest of the special forces look useless so he would look better in comparison, or if the writers just have no idea of any sort of tactics that might be used so just have people run headlong into gunfire is unclear, but it does stand out.Other aspects of this film are equally poor. The acting and writing are terrible, even accounting for things that are lost in translation, and cultural nuances I might not have picked up on. The sound is also bad, with sound effects I'm pretty sure I've heard used in podcasts incorporated here to represent are character being kicked. The CGI hardly even needs to be mentioned, as I wasn't expecting much from it, but a scene with dozens of wolves attacking soldiers does stand out as especially bad.To say something positive about this film, the stunts are impressive. No, not the highly promoted martial arts, but there are a lot of explosions in this film which looked like they were very close to the stunt performers, so I want to give kudos to them and the stunt coordinators.Overall, this film is not worth watching if you're in the West. It is just bad, and not even in an entertaining way. At best, this might give people an idea of how certain Hollywood films look to international audiences, but that is about it."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Calling out nationalist pride is kinda dumb, American movies do it too, but having mercenaries choose to attack someone in the middle of a training exercise surrounded by hundreds of soldiers is just idiotic"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"....Then watch this.People who give bad reviews to this type of action movie must be into Shakespeare,Art House flicks and the odd Rom-Com.Here,you get what you expect,action,with some nice weaponry thrown in to boot. Scott Adkins makes an excellent bad guy. Gun play and a tiny bit of martial arts thrown in for good measure equals plenty of fun. If you enjoyed,""Operation Red Sea"",then you will love this."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,The PLA is more and more like US Army. But the spirit is different. What are the soldiers fight for? USA: freedom and democracy? CHINA:motherland and the CCP? The USA culture encourage the people to question the government and limit its power. The Chinese culture consider the government as home master who will look after the people and make the people's life better. home and country are connected in Chinese culture. This is why western people can't understand why the Chinese soldier can do crazy things in Korea war and push them back to 38-line. This spirit empower the people and soldier which scares the western. Now the western want to use its own culture to eliminate the eastern culture to soft the eastern people.
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"I had heard this movie was highly rated so was really disappointed by it.It has a poor story and worse acting. Sure, it's only a $12m budget but the CGI is laughably inept. The wolves scene is as bad as the surfing scene in Escape from LA, completely unconvincing.It's a propaganda film for the People's Liberation Army, that's why it did well in China, like Rambo First Blood Part II or Rambo III in the US, but those were made 30yrs earlier.If this is what is considered a great Chinese movie, I'll stick with films from Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, etc."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Alright, alright. I understand you guys blaming this movie for plots, effects or something. Let me tell you some about this movie from an aspect of a Chinese. About the plots, effects, even dialog, you're right, they're not satisfactory, even crap, but no one cares! That's the point, no one cares, because it's really hard to see a military movie involved with present armament in China, we don't propaganda our army as much as you do in USA,no need, we're not in any war currently. So this movie is really a good opportunity to see the latest attack helicopters, the latest single soldier equipment and the latest upgraded 59 tanks(it's a pity that no 99 tank in this movie) And the actor Jing Wu, he took the training as a real special forces soldier for 2 years for this movie, so his move is pretty close to what a real special forces soldier does. Remember he loads the pistol with his shoe then blows that sniper's head? That's a real skill. So for people who don't quite know China, they might focus on the fake stuff in this movie, but for Chinese guys, we focus on the real part. By the way, for people who blame the action, Jing Wu has his best fights in some Hong Kong movies, go find them if you want to, they won't let you down."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Look, I don't know what everyone else saw, but this film is a Chinese big budget movie, AND their attempt at an 'American style' military action movie. THE TROUBLING THING IS = despite all of the lame special effects and poorly replicated action sequences, this movie goes out of its way to depict American military as the bad guys. Not just the opposing force, but unethical, immoral, despicable bad guys. If you want to watch a movie where the enemy/antagonists are US military (Navy SEALS to be precise) who do horrible, inhumane things, and the movie's heroes' are the ""awesome"", upstanding, morally superior Chinese army, then yes, you freakin' traitor, have at it. Screw this movie and everyone involved."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,Worst Asian movie I have seen! I was hoping it would be good but wishful thinkingActing and special effects were terrible.They need to learn from the Koreans !
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"This is one of those films where you really have to look past it's patriotic jingoism to enjoy it for what it is: entertainment. The story is about a reckless, loose cannon PLA spec ops sniper being taken out of prison to join the Wolf Warriors, a Chinese special forces group, and battle a force of foreign mercenaries.I can't hate on this film too hard (despite who made it and it's message), because it's honestly pretty entertaining. The action sequences are well done and the characters are sympathetic. Overall, I enjoyed it. If you're looking for a different type of perspective in action cinema, I recommend Wolf Warrior."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Awesome action film and a nice little look at the ""other side"" - where the baddies are Western and speak English, and the goodes are Chinese and call each other ""Comrade"". I liked it anyway, and here is my review:This awesome action flick has all the classic tropes and cliches we've come to expect - the goodie who is a bit of a wild card but always comes up trumps, the baddie who is a complete dick, the baddie's boss who wants to destroy all of China by creating a bioweapon (or something, I dunno), the homo-erotic showdown, the techno-death spunking gadgetry and cool war machines, the deadline to kill all of the baddies in an hour and a half or the General will bomb the crap out of everything - it's got it all!The Wolf Warriors are China's bestest and specialest of all the Special Forces - Very Special Forces, if you like. They recruit only the baddest of the bad-asses, in the case of our hero directly from the military prison, where he's languishing for killing a bad guy against orders. Their boss is a hot lady and they have respect for her, because she keeps them in line, and is awesome! And the baddies are, ohh, they're so bad, such bad lads, that they broke into China just to... but that would be telling, let's just say it's to do with the whole reason our hero is in the Wolf Warriors in the first place OMG!If you go in expecting Tropic Thunder levels of silliness, you'll actually be quite pleasantly surprised by how not stupid this film is. I mean, it's propaganda, but so was Rambo III, sod it. The baddies are bad, the goodies are good, and the action is awesome. Not to be missed! (as long as you like stupid action films)"
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Politics is people being polite, or impolite, and everywhere. Movies as entertainment reflect in varying degrees the politics of their creators. I disagree with Mayijie that America bad, China good. We are different and reflections of our histories. The PLA is the military arm of the PRC and is built for that, not just defense. When and if China becomes the premier world superpower, their foreign entanglements will mirror those of America, Soviet Union, Britain, Germany, Ottoman Empire, France, Spain, Rome, Greece, Persia and beyond. All of which can be made into entertainment and propaganda.Conversely, I was sad to read another review about the disaffection of Chinese youth and that this movie was blatantly meant to address that. Aside from the fact that Chinese youth have much to be proud of, feel good movies are as an integral part of entertainment as tear jerkers and political (internal) exposes. It's made in China, it should be ""Chinese"". I prefer smarter viewers to censorship. To me, awareness of context reflecting history overcomes the biased themes.I liked the action. The final fight sequence with Scott Adkins, the ending plot twist, the realistic tension in the land mine scene, and some of the fight sequences made it a worthwhile watch. Since my Wing Chun training didn't include Cantonese, I do wish it was dubbed. I always have to watch twice so I don't miss the movie for the subtitles. And as I speak some foreign languages, I realize how bad subtitles can be.Btw, watch the outtakes, they are great."

战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"The movie conveys an idea that a Chinese passport may not be able to take you everywhere in the world but it can take you home from anywhere in the world if there is a war or other disasters. Unfortunately, during the pandemic, the passport can take you nowhere. With the ridiculous restricted policies, the over-complicated application process, the rocket sky high flight price and intentionally stirring up hatred in China against Chinese who went back to China, it is a Sisyphean endeavour.The movie is giving people an illusion which leads them into a world where there is a blind worship. The difference between fantasy and reality, once people see it, could be devastating. I think the movie is wrong to spread incorrect ideas and give people false hope when there isn't any."
战狼2,Wolf Warrior (2015),,2015,2017.07.28,"Seriously, it is that bad. And I'm not even talking about the propaganda aspect of the movie. I'm talking about the movie itself. It's just horrible. Maybe if you REALLY love military movies you might manage to watch it until the end (not that you gonna like it any more than I did), but for me, it was just painful."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Honestly, I don't understand the bad reviews. Chan is older, but he still has the moves. The film producers didn't have American millennials in mind when they developed the script. Their target audience was China and India and I am sure the people there loved it. The film, even with its flaws of melding Chinese, Indian and English dialog, is still fun. The car chase in Dubai was incredible and Chan discovering a lion in his car was hilarious. And, in this age of crude and prurient films coming out of Hollywood, Kung Fu Yoga is a good popcorn film for the family."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"A fun, picturesque film that explores different cultures.It's like Jackie Chan meets Indiana Jones, in China, Iceland, India, and Dubai!Some reviewers are slamming JC for making this film, but hats off to him for going outside his cultural expectations and comfort zone.I have to give credit to the amazing cinematography and location sets, I'm guessing this must be one of JC's bigger budget films.All in all this movie was just plain fun. The car chase scenes with all those expensive cars in Dubai was off the hook, almost Fast & Furious like, but with more expensive sports cars.It's a shame for all the hateful reviews... JC still has the moves and is still funny and entertaining as always! Oh, and 'Little Jackie' was also a blast, I hope his stomach has settled lol."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Jackie Chan is twelve years younger than Harrison Ford, and can still pull off some impressive moves, but both actors are well past their prime in terms of action movie star power. Ford's last CGI-laden Indiana Jones movie was so bad it gave us the phrase 'nuke the fridge' to describe a scene that is beyond ridiculous. As if to prove he can go one better (or should that be 'worse'?), Chan has given us the Raider of the Lost Ark-inspired adventure Kung Fu Yoga, which is incredibly dumb and almost as much computer-generated as it is live action: it starts off with a really bad CG historical prologue, and just keeps on going with the not-very-convincing digital trickery, delivering CG car stunts, a CG lion, CG hyenas, and CG snakes, frequently against CG backdrops.Chan plays Chinese archaeologist Jack, who is approached by Indian princess Ashmita (played by drop-dead-gorgeous Bollywood babe Disha Patani) to help find a legendary treasure. Also trying to get his hands on the riches is Randall (Sonu Sood), descendant of the army general who hid the hoard. Or something like that. The plot doesn't make much sense at times, the emphasis on OTT action, not logic. Director Stanley Tong, the man behind the enjoyable Rumble in the Bronx and China Strike Force, delivers one or two 'nuke the fridge' moments of his own, the most outrageous being the high speed chase that sees Chan playing chauffeur to a CG lion.Not content with just being inspired by Indiana Jones, Tong shamelessly steals iconic elements from Spielberg's movie: there's an attractive female student at one of Jack's lectures who flirts with the professor by drawing love hearts on her eyelids; one of the characters says the line 'I hate snakes'; and the location of the treasure is revealed by sunlight shining through a diamond attached to a staff. Hell, there's even a character called Jones! Sadly, it says a lot about the overall quality of an action film when the most enjoyable scene is the closing, tongue-in-cheek Bollywood dance routine performed by the whole cast (definitely NOT taken from Indiana Jones - I can't see Harrison Ford pulling off any of those moves).3.5/10, rounded up to 4 for dishy Disha Patani: terrible actress but great to look at."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"In 647AD India, leader of the elephant legion Arunasva revolts against his ruler Magadha. Magadha sends General Bhima with treasure tributes to guide Wang Xuance back to the Tang Dynasty to request for military assistance. Bhima and his men are lost with the treasure. Wang makes it back to China and returns to India to rout Arunasva. Professor Ashmita is from present day India. She arrives in Xi'an to recruit Chinese archaeology professor Jack Chan (Jackie Chan) to find Bhima and the lost treasure. The group finds the lost army in an ice cave only to be attacked by Randall leading mercenaries. He's trying to clear the name of his rebel ancestor and steal the treasure.This movie is problematic for several reasons. The action is OK but the movie struggles whenever the action stops. The movie starts with a big CGI battle. It looks too video-gamey. The inferior CGI is excusable but it's not a good start. It's also a lot of exposition to unpack. It doesn't need to be when the audience is willing to follow a lost army without learning the Sino-Indian history.There are some beautiful people but there are also some limitations on the acting. It doesn't help that the writing gets stale at times. I love Jackie Chan but he should be more Indiana Jones. Starting as a professor with all the tech gadgets make him less appealing. Instead of an action hero, he starts too much as a bookish techie. Then there is the treasure hunt. It goes from one place to another on flimsy excuses. There's no reason why Magadha would send a key to the underground treasure to China. The movie ends in a Bollywood dance off. I understand the attempt but it sucks out any remaining tension. This has the potential of an action adventure but it suffers from ongoing stumbles."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Well, not all Bollywood. Not enough dance routine to make that claim ( Unless like me you count Jackie's Kung Fu fighting as dancing) I herd some Bollywood director was suppose to film it but backed out leaving Chinese cinema veteran Stanley Tong to fill the void. It's a great action adventure film (with a bad title) in what looks like it could be the sequel to Armour of the Gods or Operation Condor (which in America would be considered Armour of the Gods 2). Jackie Chan plays Jack Chan (Really?) an archaeologist looking for a treasure that connects Chinese and Indian culture, and when he finds it this ultimate Bollywood Archetype comes after him for it.It's not Jackie at his prime but he's at his best mixing humor with action. You'll See him do little stunts like jump through a luggage carrier with style (most of us half his age can't do that) and you'll see him do some really good old school kung fu moves like he did in Fearless Hyena.But he's too old to be breaking bones for our enjoyment. Instead, he provides us with typical action movie fluff. Not to say that's bad. There is a car chase in the movie that is pretty fantastic. This was an excellent return to the Jackie from yesteryear."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Kung Fu Yoga is as stereotypical as its title might suggest but despite average acting performances, artificial special effects and a weak plot, it's an entertaining, fast-paced and quirky movie that mixes stunning fight choreography, exotic settings and an intriguing mixture of Arab, Chinese and Indian cultures.The story revolves around India's lost Magadha treasure in Tibet that is searched by three different parties: Chinese archaeologists, descendants of Magadha royalty and a ruthless group of mercenaries led by another descendant of an Indian royalty. The plot has a few minor but overall predictable twists. While the story is overall of an average quality at best, the movie focuses on fast-paced action- adventure elements in the key of the Indiana Jones movies. Short humorous passages and mythological elements add to the genre potpourri. There are a few truly memorable scenes in this movie. The opening animated history sequence is quite unusual and starts the movie on an original note to give the audience some background information. The closing dance choreography as well as the vivid soundtrack are also quite entertaining. The best part can however be found in the middle of the movie and consists of a spectacular chase through the streets of Dubai involving a vomiting lion. Despite the ridiculous idea, I haven't laughed that hard in quite a while which means that the makers of this movie have accomplished their mission.Kung Fu Yoga doesn't take itself too seriously and that what makes its charm. It's an entertaining movie that works best when you switch your brain off and try to enjoy the ride. It offers a colourful, exotic and explosive change from your everyday life. It also marks one of the few major collaborations between Chinese and Indian cinema and I hope to witness more occasions where these two countries join their forces. Kung Fu Yoga isn't an essential movie but an entertaining action- adventure movie for young adults and teenagers in particular."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"The biggest nonsense I have ever seen. There is no worse CGI in any film. Embarrassing fake friendship from China to India. Super bad acting. All the actresses are models. Top! Jacky Chan looks like 100. When the Chinese resort to Tibetan armies in the Middle Ages, you know about the propaganda level. Only playable in India and China."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I can't believe it, Jackie Chan is a LEGEND, he knows how to make action, he knows how to make a good story, but this?! THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IS THE CGI, look, I know Jackie is trying to go new school with the CGI because he is getting older but honestly this is NOT the way to do it, this was some of the WORST CGI I have ever seen especially considering that Jackie Chan is pretty much considered an ""A List"" actor.Here is what gets me though, Jackie Chan knows how to make a good story, want proof? Well he directed ""Police Story"" and ""Project A"" movies like that way back in the 80's and even more recent ""Who Am I"" in 1998...After that I feel like he's been trying to depend on CGI just too much, I don't really know what to say, it's like the movies he's recently made feel too rushed? Skiptrace, Railroad Tigers, and Kung Fu Yoga ALL FELT LIKE RUSHED HALF ASSED MOVIES...I don't know what Jackie Chan is thinking... Before around 2010 and below it felt like his movies were perfect, no rush but now since after that it's almost like he's just pumping out movies just for the money and little to no care is gone into them...Jackie you are from the golden age of cinema, DO NOT ADAPT the CGI, I say just go back to how you used to make movies in the 80's and 90's EVEN THOUGH you can't do the stunts you used to be able to do just use doubles when necessary... YOU CAN STILL DO YOUR FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, there is nothing stopping you from doing that, people just want to see you doing your stuff and you have a lot to offer just in hand to hand choreography anyway that does not require CGI or any doubles!But what the hell do I know? We are living in a CGI world now unfortunately...P.S the only reason I rate this 2 out of 10 is because there were quite a few good fight choreography moments"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Why? Seriously, just why? Jackie Chan once again delivers a boring adventure movie that doesn't even come close to the heights of his early career in the 80s and 90s. Kung Fu Yoga is boring, dumb, way too cartoonish, and not that fun.I have the same problem with this that I did with Chan's other 2012 action/adventure project, Sap ji sang ciu (2012). Both movies focused way too much on the adventure plot, with way too little of a focus on why everyone loves Jackie. Yes he's funny and likable, but we want to see him fight and do stuns and there is painfully little of that here. The girls' roles were obnoxious and not well fleshed out, and the scene with the hyenas was ok, but a little annoying. The villain is not very evil, and too OTT. He's annoying, and seems like a villain from a Disney movie. The ending has to be one of the weirdest movie endings I've ever seen. Like, the entire cast does this big choreographed dance, and they sing. Seriously, what?Stanley Tong, obviously trying something new, should stick to his usual action territory. This movie's marketing made a big deal out of him directing, which is fair as he's responsible for some of Jackie's all-time best vehicles. Here though, he abandons everything everyone loved about his previous works for this strange, strange movie.There are some fun action scenes. The fight in the ice caves, the street fight, the fight with the briefcase, the car chase (in which Jackie drives a car with a lion in it), and the final fight. The long climax in the caves with the artifacts is very derivative of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), and while the final fight is ok, it's a little short.I can't recommend this one, and even Jackie Chan fans should exercise caution. It's not very fun, and much screen time is given to people we don't care about. It seems here that Jackie's losing his edge for the action scenes, but he proved that he obviously still has it with The Foreigner (2017) in the same year."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"The overall plot is that Chan teams up with an Indian archaeologist who is interested in a historical legacy that is shared by India and China. Chan's team is devoted to the respect and preservation of this joint history and its ancient roots. (No Spoilers, but things are not quite what they seem.) Another great action film featuring Jackie Chan, here a modern version of Indiana Jones with the added touch of his classic kung fu moves. (In fact, Indiana Jones is referenced directly at one point in this movie. (No spoilers!)) Several humorous scenes mixed in with the usual combination of action scenes that are typical in Chan's movies, and as usual kung fu saves the day. It's refreshing to have a family-friendly film. Choreography is great throughout, but most especially in the closing scene, which is meant to emphasize the unity Chan's team strives to discover. Great use of costumes and technology throughout the film. Intricate set designs and a few scenes showcasing the beauty of modern India and classic artifacts from both cultures. (Whether the ""artifacts"" are authentic or fictional, I can't say for sure, but the effects are brilliant.)(It would have been great to have cleaner subtitles, though, which is really the only negative about the film.)"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"First, I must say that I have been a big fan of JC for many many years, from his early films to the current. For his sake I give this 2 stars. Otherwise this film is really a low point for him. Its great to see him still involved with cinema while we understand that he is getting up there as his best trademark stunts and martial arts years are behind him. However...whew..this one really blows chunks. From other reviews I've read there seems to have been a reason fro him to engage in a Chinese-Indian collaborative effort, but the result was lame and laughable at best. Could this mess truly have costed $65 mil?? Lets begin: The story arc of having to piece together historic clues to search for long lost artifacts that proceeds to become a treasure hunt running around to various locations that leads to another ""final"" treasure is soooo cliche, Indian Jones formulaic and just poorly done. Especially with ""actors"" that obviously have no chemistry between them or just seem so out of place within the whole scope of the film. It starts with a low-qual CG cartoon and ends in cartoon-ish style with the ""villain"" seemingly filled with a spiritual revival joining the the cast in one of those horrendous and awkward Bollywood synchronized gang dances as they all bow down and worship a statue in true pagan style. Wedged in between all of the noodnickery is an exotic car chase (with the only brief laugh of a CG lion stuck in the back seat of JC's vehicle), and some of JC's kung fu antics sprinkled about to seemingly remind us of his legendary prowess. The whole movie has lacks originality as well as even the minutest amount of quality acting. It's as if a chef with no culinary knowledge just tosses a bunch of disparate ingredients into a large pot and then serves it up hoping that he actually made something edible. Another solid entry into the Netflix menu of unpalatable, torrid-tasting indigestible sea-chum that has no redeeming value or reason to be remembered. Compliments to the chef."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,Hi Jackie Chan.. Everyone loves you in India.. but please stop acting in lame movies like this. I recommend you to act in next part of rush hour or..even reboot Armor of God franchise.. Please.. we do not expect you to do such low budget bad movies.. this is very disappointing.. this is a really bad movie and a poor choice.. you are a legend.. why would you accept such lame movies? I don't understand this.. please do something new.. Entire world loved Armor of God franchise.. you should make more squeals of that one rather then such dumb movies.. It is really sad to see your reputation going down by poor choices made by you.. please on the love of Jesus.. be vise when you select movies.. we are really waiting for some amazing movies from you as everyone loves you a lot.. please make something cool... thank you..
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Kung Fu Yoga was named after the co-production of Indo-Chinese partnership. Of course there is a lot of Kung Fu, but wait a minute where is Yoga? You can't see a bit of Yoga in it.The movie was good as far as Jackie and the action scenes are concerned. Jackie Chan was excellent in his stunts and comic expressions. He hasn't disappointed his fans and he brings in a surprise dance performance in the item song.Apart from Jackie nothing works in the movie. Even Jackie Chan's actions are restricted at times. The movie travels from China to India, a bit of Dubai for just one car chase scene. Too much of information are poured in the first 10 minutes of the movie which actually confuses the audience.Kung fu yoga poster Few minutes into the movie just feels this is not going to be what it should be. The beginning doesn't feel like a beginning, It just starts abruptly which indeed has driven out the excitement in watching the movie.Sonu Sood who carries the Indian baddie role should have been a bit better. He doesn't feel like a baddie at times. Disha Patani as Jackie's lead is OK. Wearing some high valued ornaments, dresses with fur are the major contribution she delivers. The age old rope tricks, some floating tricks by sadhus might impress few (Does the movie really belongs to 2017?).The item song which casts the entire cast was one of the few good moments in the movie. It was great and watching Chan dance was extremely pleasing. There are few good moments to wake the sleeping audience.On the whole the movie is one time watch for family audience."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Jackie Chan movies while never really good are always fun to watch. The comedy elements in the fight scenes always make them fun to watch. I recently saw a Jackie Chan movie titled, Railroad Tigers which was actually quite good.With Kung Fu Yoga, Jackie Chan has undone all the good work that he has done in the many decades that he has been active. To say that it is a bad movie would be to insult all the bad movies that have been made.Kung Fu Yoga is a monstrosity of epic proportions. Its like the director has a rich father and one morning he woke up and decided to blow up a few million of his fathers money. I doubt he is held a camera in his hands before. I am certain that when he started shooting he must have shot a few scenes with the lens cap on till someone told him that its supposed to be taken off. I bet Ram Gopal Varma is a better director than this clown who made Kung Fu Yoga.Disha Patani & Amyra Dastur look beautiful but by God they cannot act. It is a sad testimony to your acting prowess if even Jackie Chan is a better actor than you. Its like that scene from Oprah....you get a car! you get a car!. Its like there is someone in India going around finding good looking women and telling them, you are an actor! you are an actor!You all are actors! I don't know if this classifies as a Hollywood movie but if it was, Disha Patani would be walking away with the Razzies for worst female actor. She might even get a lifetime Razzie. If she gives up right now she still has time to learn a new trade like carpentry or lathe work. By God she is terrible at acting.All in all an hour & forty minutes of mind numbing movie making. If you liked the movie then you need to get yourself medically evaluated by a professional. You cannot be normal and like this movie.Might just be the worst movie ever made."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This is not some film. The project was decided when two leaders of the respective nation met a couple of years ago. More like it is China's move to mend the relationship with India. So except Indian cast participation and a few Indian locations, this is completely 'made in China' and for the Chinese market. Like always any Chinese product, this is not a quality product. Just an another 'The Myth' from the same director.Team up between India and China is a rare thing in filmdom, so I was curious about that. It should have been a star studded cast, but from the Chinese side, it does, not on the Indian side. The worst screenplay award goes for Mr. Tong. Literally, it is a retelling story of those great treasure hunt adventure films we had seen so far in our life. Even Jackie Chan could not save it. His presence failed to do the usual magic. Like his signature, action-comedy, nothing new to appreciate either his part or the film.The story follows the famous Chinese archaeologist Jack, who teams up with his Indian counterpart for a new quest. Equipped with the modern technological tools, the crew heads for a frozen lake in the Himalayas. It's the first and an important clue for the rest of the treasure hunt. But it was interrupted by a group of armed men and soon the tale flies to Dubai, followed by Western India, where it comes to end with lots of action and adventures.❝'Vastu Shastra', the oldest book ever written about architectural design.❞The opening scene sets in some thousand years ago. The graphics were very poor in that part. Even computer games have much better CGI work. So I lost the interest in the film within the first sixty seconds. The stunt choreography was unbelievably terrible. I mean too much unrealistic, I felt it like I was watching some kind of commercial Tollywood/Rajamouli film. Surely this film was not made under the art and the film-making value. It seems nobody was interested to participate or make a quality film. They made it to just to keep the promise made by the politicians, so it was wrapped up awfully.I thought it was a bad combination of words for a title. Kung fu and Yoga. Like the polar opposite, two different philosophies. One is violence and the other one is peace and healthy. Though not bad how those two were utilised to tell the tale. This is a watchable film, but no good at all. Might be the worst Jackie Chan film I've ever seen. Promoting the unrealistic road projects in the film was a bad idea, and enough reason to flop in India.There are many good actresses in India, but they have picked Disha Patani. She's a real beauty, but the performance was worse than the film's graphics. I could not stand for her dialogue deliverance. She just read them rather than expressing naturally as any actors do in the world. The end was really disappointing. An easy compromise. It's good for the real life, but not good for an entertainment film. Those who are seeking treasure hunt film, just stay away from it. Because it looks more like a parody than a distinct one. Overall the film was overwhelmed by lots bad parts. So easily a skippable film of the year, which has a big name in it.02/10"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Cheap trash from every aspect. Cheap CGI, really bad acting, awfully bad story. BTW stuffed even with some Chinese state propaganda slogans ('Belt and Road'). I don't intend to start any political discussion, but it sounds really unnatural to add such lines to an action title. I cannot understand how JC could participate in this shameful movie."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This is a delightful (perhaps unintentional) parody of Hollywood action films (not just Indiana Doom and the Temple of Jones). We can see how absurd it is to have ""heroes"" from a different culture present themselves in a foreign nation. The Indian bad guys are exceptionally bad performers with their boss Randall character being creepy as well as nefarious. No wonder this was a box office failure in India and a blockbuster success in China.The CGI was quite a good except at the beginning with the mammoth elephants - I took that as acceptable given Professor Jack was telling a story (background to the plot)I watched the dance scene thrice. It reminded me of the promotional video for ""Romancing the Stone"".Cheeky Fun."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"In an effort to locate an archaeological site of incredible historical significance, one professor from China named ""Jack"" (Jackie Chan) and another from India by the name of ""Ashmita"" (Disha Pitani) team up to combine their resources. However, the fact that this site also contains an incredible amount of treasure as well results in other parties following their every move in order to glean as much information as they can for their own ulterior purposes-and these people are willing to do whatever it takes to get their hands on it. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film turned out to be rather disappointing for a number of reasons. For starters, I didn't care for the animation or computer graphics used on several of the action scenes. Likewise, the humor wasn't very sharp, the action itself was quite tedious and the script was just plain awful. As a matter of fact, about the only part of the movie that was any good was the ending which had a really good song and dance number. In short, while this might be entertaining for younger audiences, I didn't especially care for it and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I always have been a Jackie Chan's fan and in this movie I felt like when I was a kid watching the Jackies' old movies. If you want to have a relaxing moment and give some laughs, go to watch with the family, in special that person who liked Jackies' classic movies.I watched in a movie theater in China, so I enjoyed even more with the reaction of the Chinese audience that laughed a lot hahaha.But If you want a something serious and realistic, go elsewhere. There a some special effects that are not so special and it seems that they made it on porpoise to reinforce the idea that is just fun and is not trying to be an remarkable movie but just one modern version of the old Jackie(that is in a good shape, despite the age)"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Jackie Chan has been on a roll of late, churning out film after film in a short space of time. This one's part of an unconnected trilogy that includes RAILROAD TIGERS and SKIPTRACE. Of the three, SKIPTRACE is the only one I can say that I truly enjoyed; the rest have been middling or, in the case of KUNG FU YOGA, pretty bad. Jackie plays his reliable self here and there's an extended cameo from old buddy Eric Tsang, but those are the only good things about it.The plot heavily copies INDIANA JONES (a character is even called Jones) and involves the hunt for some ancient treasure in India. It's a bit like THE MYTH, but not as good. The only bit I liked was the photorealistic CGI historical back story at the opening of the movie. The rest is a mish mash of really bad attempted comedy scenes involving the young cast members, who are all completely dreadful actors delivering stilted lines throughout. I thought the Chinese actors were bad, but they're nothing compared to the woodenness of the Indian actors. The action is CGI dominated and Jackie's fights are always sped up, which is disappointing, and the predominance of CGI animals is more annoying than anything else."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Meandering, aimless plot, bad cgi animals, worse cgi car chase, and campy acting."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I had some hope for ""Kung Fu Yoga"", seeing that it was directed by Stanley Tong, who had directed Jackie Chan in some very entertaining kung fu movies in the past. Although I really like Jackie Chan, I was very disappointed with this particular effort. It's not the worst movie Chan has appeared in recent years - it definitely is better than ""Railroad Tigers"" and ""Skiptrace"". And the movie is gorgeous to look at, thanks to a combination of scenic locations, nice looking sets, and very good cinematography. But the movie is surprisingly dull or lacking sufficient spark to really be a grabber. I realize that Chan is older now, and is lacking the nimbleness that he had in the past. But I still think that his fight scenes could have been better choreographed and directed - here the camera is more often than not close up, and there is more editing in the fights rather than showcasing the fights with lengthy takes. The script could have used some work as well, being that the plot has some confusing touches, and doesn't provide a satisfying ending. You will see a much better movie struggling to get out throughout, but it never quite gets out of its mediocre quicksand."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I've watched Jackie Chan's movies since young. When watching a movie featuring Jackie Chan, you would expect the standard of movie to be that of CZ12, Police Story and Rush Hour. But I was so wrong as the movie started. The CGI was so bad and there were many pointless scenes at the start. There was no chemistry between Jackie Chan and the princess and their scenes are painfully awkward. Some scenes were confusing as there was no purpose in including the scenes. The CGI, yes, it was horrendously unwatchable. Why did they animate everything for the first scene when they can just use a green screen? Even the people were animated! The English dialogue was awkward as hell and the characters sound like they were memorizing lines instead of speaking to each other. However, there were good points of this film. Even though the English dialogue was really bad, the Chinese dialogue flows well(only if you actually speak the language). The chemistry between Amyra Dastur and Aarif Rahman was surprisingly good, despite the fact that they spoke different languages. There were some scenes that was funny. However, all these good points just isn't enough to cover the flaws of the film. Overall, this film is not a good Chinese New Year movie and there are better Chinese New Year films as compared to this movie this year.5/5"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"So i pretty sure Kung-Fu Yoga is the sequels to the highly anticipated jackie chan movie The Myth in 2005 that also directed by Stanley Tong featuring Jackie as an awkward and funny Chinese archaeologist but also very good at kung-fu.This time the journey takes place in India with a missing crystal that lead Jackie and his gang to discover a history mystery between the china and India.If you a hardcore fan of Jackie you will sure enjoy this movie because it has some very beautiful cinematography,a fun energetic cast members that delivery good slapstick comedy,many well choreographed martial arts fight scene and cool stunt sequences delivery by Jackie as always but but the thing that ruin the whole movie for me is the overuse of animal GCI attack scene,some very bright and colorful scene that make my head dizzy and a ridiculous final arc when during the final showdown between Jackie and the main villain it suddenly turn into a genetic Bollywood musical scene that make me very angry"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"It's a commercial success because everyone was expecting great things from a JACKIE CHAN's movie just like I did. However it literally made me SICK. Super awful!!!!!!!! Too many ridiculous scenes and bad directing. I am too too disappointed in this. It is such a waste of your reputation and talent! Please don't ruin my head again. This will definitely make me rethink again before any of Jackie Chan movie coming out. I was 100% sure I would have a good time watching this before it blew up my head and drove my stress to the max!!!!! With all due respect to Mr. Tong the writer and director, please think again before you come up with some similar half done work and I do hope you could take a script writing class to reduce the non-sense in any of your dreamed projects. And Mr. Chan, kindly do not ruin your reputation with anything like this ever again...I was all fan until now ...Awful!"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Seriously though... I don't understand what all the critics were crying about!Yes its got dreadful writing, cheesiness galore, and some cuts that make you raise an eyebrow - but it clearly states Stanley Tong is the director, and lets be honest, no one has ever claimed he's the greatest director in the world. But from Stone-age Warriors to China Strike Force (not to mention his fantastic Chan collaborations), it cannot be argued that Stanley Tong doesn't deliver on action scenes and good old entertainment!And with that, Kung Fu Yoga is a prime example of Tong pure entertainment. Packed with fun action scenes, gorgeous colours, great fight choreography and a fantastic Bollywood dance sequence, you soon start to see past the imperfect CGI moments and the drawn out boring dialogue to enjoy the film for what it is.Many critics complained so hard about these little things yet as a loyal HK movie fan of 35 years, I say its something we should expect from Tong at this point. The man seems to have set his focus on the US folk creating a safe, brainless, colourful, family friendly film that entertains and will sell easy, with the bonus of having his money making king of action, Jackie Chan front and centre.And rightly so!As a loose sequel to his last directorial Chan feature - The Myth - this latest story is lighter in tone, with less focus on the historic bloody battle scenes, and more on the modern day comedy. That said, we are introduced to the story with a fully animated opening set 100 years ago which I thought was great (and personally would love to see more of) but most critics screamed about and compared it to that of a late 90's video game. I guess given a bigger time and budget, it would have been amazing to see this filmed live-action considering the awesome fight scenes and setting.But again, such minor yelps considering the entertainment value of the whole thing...At 62 (at time of filming), Jackie Chan still has the ability to fight, move and charm more than most film stars of his age group - and some even younger. Whether wire assisted or not, he still has it and Kung Fu Yoga highlights some great action moments with him. That said, the highlights of the fighting are handed over to the youth in the shape of the handsome Aarif Kim (Young Bruce Lee) who's moves are as cool as his charm, and I hope he continues down the action route in the near future.All of the cast get to throw some kicks and punches, with some great results that give a few nods to the fantastic Operation Condor (Armour of God 2), and even Chinese Zodiac. The stunt filled super-car chase through Dubai was a lot of fun and had Tong written all over it, and thankfully - unlike the earlier Chan & Tong flicks - we get a final fight scene with all involved, that includes some fun choreography and great moves!And just before you start thinking Stanley Tong is giving us back the good old Jackie Chan 'end of film' formula we get surprised and treated to a full-on Bollywood musical number that replaces the NG's and bloopers we always look forward to in a Chan flick. Well, I guess you can't have everything eh?Once again, the critics starting crying about this, but I just don't get why! A wonderfully choreographed number, you can see the genuine happiness in Jackie's face, with a great song and music that sticks in your head. Yes its different, and yes, it does work! The film is a Chinese and Indian production after all with lots of kung fu - but not a lot of yoga - so I'm happy that they closed the film in a typically Bollywood fashion, and done right also.Kung Fu Yoga doesn't suck! Its good solid 'family' entertainment with great action, comedy and Jackie Chan. Sure, Stanley Tong will never be my favourite director, but he's made a Chan flick that is more fun than The Tuxedo, The Spy Next Door, Skiptrace and for me, even Rush Hour...And as long I can continue to enjoy watching my hero kick some ass and make me laugh, I'm quite happy to give this the thumbs up!"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Having grown up with the countless Jackie Chan movies, there is always a sense of excitement whenever there is a new movie available from the master of stunts and martial arts. And I was, of course, thrilled to get a chance to sit down and watch ""Kung Fu Yoga"" (aka ""Gong fu yu jia"").There is a sense of this being a Chinese version of ""Indiana Jones"" that permeates this movie. Not in a bad way, mind you. With that statement I mean that there is a lot of adventure to this movie, and it is spiced up with the usual comedy that we see in most of Jackie Chan's movies. And, of course, it works out as a great combination.True to the Jackie Chan legacy, then there is a lot of action in the movie, and it is the level of action and magnificent performance of action that we all love from Jackie Chan. And this action is mixed with the right amount of traditional Jackie Chan physical comedy. So in a sense, this is a very standard Jackie Chan movie. But director Stanley Tong manages to keep the movie fresh and constantly in a good gear.The story, however, now that is a different matter. Because no matter how much Jackie Chan's action is impressive and the comedy Integrated is fun to watch, then the movie was just suffering from having a mediocre storyline from writer/director Stanley Tong.I was especially amused and entertained with the scene that included a very small car, Jackie Chan by the steering wheel and a huge lion on the backseat. Sure, the lion was CGI animated and painstakingly obviously so, it was still a hilarious scene to watch.If you enjoy the typical Jackie Chan movie, then you will definitely also enjoy ""Kung Fu Yoga"". However, if you expect a deviant performance from the usual Jackie Chan movies, then this is not the movie for you. I found the movie to be quite entertaining, despite only delivering a mediocre storyline. As such, I am rating the movie 6 out of 10 stars."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Jackie Chan reunites with Stanley Tong to produce an 'Indiana Jones' type of action adventure and treasure hunting film. The film is entertaining.It has car chase scene,hand to hand combat fighting,beautiful scenery,exotic locations,twisted plots,handsome actors and beautiful actress. Overall the film is fun and not boring. Jackie Chan had several opportunities to show off his physical ability and martial art skills,which had been missing in his recent previous films such as 'Skiptrace' and 'Railroad Tigers' . Ture Chan fans should be satisfied in these aspects. However it was obvious that Chan was getting slower in performing his trademark action. Also several scenes were produced with unnecessary ,fake and poor quality CGI. These had lower the quality and the realism of the film. Director Tong should either cut those scenes or re-write the script if he is not able to shoot those scenes in real.'Kung Fu Yoga' will let audiences to recall and missed the glorious day of Jackie Chan and his old film such as 'Operation Condor','First Strike','Supercop' ,'Rumble in the Bronxe' and 'Who am I'."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This is the worst movie that Jackie Chan ever acted in. He is an amazing actor, martial artist and Icon. There are no words to describe how good he is. I am not sure why he chose to do this low budgeted crap. The story is absolute non sense, they have tried to make it on the lines of Indiana Jones but this movie can be very well called as TANDOORI JONES. Jackie Chan is trying to find ancient diamond, which doesn't look like a diamond in any way. The whole crew keeps running like crazy like the chicken with its head cut off. The set is so horrible, doesn't look like Himalayas in any way. Sonu Sold is fighting with Jackie and is actually beating him...... I mean c'mon. On one hand you have the martial arts legend and on other side there is this Bollywood actor without any skills and he is beating Jackie. How stupid it could be?????? Behold the climax, there are Chinese actors dressed as Indian Monks. How stupid could the director be? There are 1.3 billion Indians and you have to find Chinese actors posing as Indinan Monks. Don't WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. KEEP YOUR RESPECT FOR JACKIE AND Don't WATCH THIS BLUNDER."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"REVIEW - KUNG FU YOGA OK first things first, I've always loved Jackie Chan and in this Chan does it again! You have to admire the man, in his 60s but can still perform his own stunts and amazingly quick fight sequences.Yes this was the first film I've ever seen him make that has used some CGI but I can forgive him for that because the film still retains his humour, speed, stunts and well Jackie.Thoroughly enjoyed it with quite a few genuine laugh out loud moments, highly recommend it you get the chance.I'm waiting for his next film The Foreigner which looks amazing, in the style of Jet Li's Dog."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"While Jackie Chan is famous, he is not known for quality cinema. That said, this is by far the worst of his movies that I have had the bad luck of watching. The production value, acting, dialogues, narrative are all so poor that you cannot imagine that people paid to watch this.Disha Patani, who has pretty much no experience is mostly used as a prop, the insertion of Chinese government propaganda just makes all this in very poor taste."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Reviews here are less than helpful, Jackie is still the man. People complain about the CGI, this movie only cost 35 million to make, not 100, people complian about the script, have you ever seen a Jackie Chan movie? One person even said reboot Armour of God, lol, why? The series is still going, check out Chinese Zodiac, another great Jackie movie, this is a fun movie, check it out"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Worthless piece of trash that overdoes cultural stereotypes, bad acting, ridiculous dialogue, overdone CGI, confusing - we kept watching to see if the rest of it could possibly be worse than the first 5 minutes of it. And it was. It goes from bad,l to worse to embarrassing and beyond."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This is a fairly dumb action movie, but it is entertaining, with a betrayal or two, and there is fighting, danger and several women being pretty. So . . . OK!Jackie Chan plays a professor of archaeology who also happens to be good at his kung fu, with a friendly acquaintance who is a treasure hunter. There is a woman who claims to have a treasure map, and there is a bad guy who wants to steal and own everything, based on the idea that the gold treasure they are about to find belonged to an ancestor of his.It turns out that the woman with the treasure map is not who she first appears to be . . . and one of Jackie Chan's character's friends turns into a betrayer for a while and then is helpful again. There is fighting and fun."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"After a string of serious roles it's nice to watch Jackie in an old school action comedy similar to ones I used to watch growing up, it's true it isn't perfect and it's cheesy in parts, but that's always been the appeal of Jackie to me, fun martial arts comedies with great fights and breathtaking stunts, and story an afterthought just to string along the set pieces, and I love it always have Jackie chan is my hero, now sure the stunts have slowed down and he can't exactly do what he was doing in the 90's but he's still making enjoyable films and I love him for that, I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie and I'm confused, this delivered exactly what I expected it too, a nice fun little action romp, think armour of god lite, the movie is actually a sort of sequel to 2015's the myth as I'm sure Jackie is playing the same role, I still think the myth is better but this is great fun too, I recommend to Jackie chan fans."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This was a bit of a disappointment to me, even if it was Stanley Tong's return to directing Jackie Chan after a dozen years. Mr. Chan has become an international star, and so his producers can afford to spend a lot of money on production values, such as flying the cast to Iceland for location shooting, and wrecking Lamborghinis in the Emirate States; Mr. Chan is also slightly older than I am, so he cannot do the amazing, funny, real life stunts that made his movies such a treat. Oh, he does more than in his American flicks, but the fast pace of cutting, shooting his character from behind and some very obvious undercranking, as well as watching his younger cast do the stuff he used to, saddens me.Anyway, the production values and Mr. Chan as a clothes horse make this a watchable movie, as China's Greatest Archaeologist, Professor Chan, is caught up in a hunt for treasure/artifacts from fifteen hundred years ago, involving Indian ranis and a huge pink diamond. There is a funny comic sequence in which the good guys wander through a market where fakirs are performing, and various members of the cast do Jackie-style gags with cobras and the Indian Rope Trick. Not Jackie so much, alas."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"US$ 65 million is supposedly a whopping budget (for Indo-China standards) to conjure up an epic historical fantasy flick. An able director at the helm (Stanley Tong - remember the witty-actioner 'Rumble in the Bronx'?), Jackie Chan in the lead, Sonu Sood playing the antagonist, a few great-looking Indian/Chinese sophomore actors playing supporting characters, and locations set in China, India and UAE..all of it must have sounded amazing as a conception. However, the final product is a stale one.Amateurish (mo-cap) CGI work kicks things off in disenchanting fashion (we see much better graphics work in video games these days). The history is unraveled as swift as Chan's fist-moves - simply not giving the viewers a chance to comprehend what exactly they just saw. Fast forward to present day treasure-hunt led by Chan (whose character's name is Jackie, ugh!) and a few others (assistants, professors and the like - young actors Disha Patani, Amyra Dastur, Aarif Rahman and Miya Muqi) that takes them on a roller-coaster journey to Kunlun, Dubai and Rajasthan, with Sood's (badly-written) character Randall hot on their trail.Set-pieces involving CGI animals (about 4 in number) such as wolves, lions, hyenas and snakes are so unimaginatively executed that the film feels more on the lines of a lacklustre Disney adventure strictly made for kids. Dubai has been chosen as a location just to add an 'expensive car-chase' sequence with Chan finding an unexpected (CGI) guest in his car's backseat. The ladies (Patani and Dastur) are goddesses by their looks but seem to 'news-read' their respective lines without improvising one bit. However, they are marginally able to redeem themselves (performing some slick moves) during the set-pieces. The ending is a huge letdown, a humdrum set-piece that culminates in a Bollywood-style dance number (choreographed by Farah Khan), even before the story has formally concluded. Plus you don't get to see the usual Chan bloopers during the end credits. For a film titled 'Kung Fu Yoga', there's very little essence of yoga portrayed in the film. The film did draw flak on its depiction of modern day India but it isn't just that factor alone which bogs it down. The movie isn't exactly difficult to sit through, but it barely manages to engage/thrill.Verdict: Not much to adore here!"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"""Kung Fu Yoga"" is not one of Jackie Chan's best films. It's way better than ""The Tuxedo"" or ""The Medallion,"" but not nearly as good as some of my favorites, such as ""Mr. Nice Guy,"" ""Who Am I?"" or ""Chinese Zodiac."" I personally prefer his later big-budget productions over his earlier films. Jackie Chan is still amazing at 63 and doing stunts and spirited fight choreography. Jackie is older than Jet Li or Jean-Claude Van Damme, but he can handle action scenes much better than either of them and is still cranking out several movies a year. He's slowing down a bit and much of the action is handled by younger actors, including several females, and by various dangerous animals. There is more reliance on fighting with various stick-like objects, swords and firearms and a lengthy car chase involving super-exotic vehicles. The plot is a flimsy excuse for action sequences, sprinkled with random facts about ancient cultures and spiritual beliefs, with several romances that never quite make it into second gear and comments about social responsibilities. The final scene goes full-on Bollywood and is worth the price of admission. It makes no pretense of being cerebral. The plot couldn't be less Byzantine. The McGuffin and a few ideas are borrowed from the Indiana Jones films. However, the production values are solid it has an abundance of Jackie's trademark fight sequences, parkour and gymnastics. In fact, he displays several different fight styles in one sequence. For Jackie Chan fans, it is a credible addition to a distinguished body of work."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Terrible movie. I wouldn't even recommend it for kids. The actors are terrible, the story doesn't add up, the characters are bad cartoons... so many bad things. I don't say this often, but seeing this movie was definitely a waste of time. The only good thing are the ""fights"", which are entertaining, though unrealistic."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,It was great action. A great story and sometimes pretty funny. You will love the end! It was a great meshing of two cultures. The visuals and clothes were outstandingI could watch that movie a couple more times.
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Ever have a movie that you were just getting to the point of turning it off because of the complete lack of intrigue, or credible plot? This is that kind of movie, until the main character ""borrows"" an SUV from a rich arab in Dubai for a high speed chase and finds a lion is sitting the back seat.As Jackie Chan gets older, he tends to be embracing more projects that are family friendly, and are about preservation of culture. Aimed squarely at the Indo-Chinese family and early teen market, Kung Fu Yoga spends more time lecturing on preserving cultural history than telling a good story. There is a story there, not much of one, but it is there, loosely tied together by very simple connecting conversations as memorable as, ""Hey we need to do X... Ok, go"". Maybe it's lost in translation, but this is hard to believe when half of the movie is in english, while the other random half of the dialogue is in chinese.The plot follows that an ancient grudge over treasure ended in a mystery, and so a chinese archaeologist is hired to find it with his wonder skill - technology. They literally throw every cool camera gadget at you, drones, gopros, steady cams, wireless cameras etc... It's the youtube generation. Soon the cast is swept up in a 160 million dollar conspiracy to reclaim artifacts with a disputed ownership and a bad guy who's, kinda bad... but kinda nice... I mean, he's kinda a hunk.The production value isn't setting a very high bar, with poor acting, terrible script writing but there are the elaborate sets which are for stunted action performances that are more about showcasing cultural styles of fighting than actually following any reasonable progression. Curiously, the highest production value is found in a decent music video at the end of the film - which I actually recommend.Conclusion:With a poorly conceived plot, terrible writing and only a few jokes that didn't fall flat, this movie isn't going to make any memories for brilliant film making. Where it does work, is in its family-friendly, silly humour for young minds, and for its nod, albeit goofy nod, to the religious traditions of India."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"""Minor spoiler (I GUESS)"" I spent 20 minutes into this movie, and the incoherence and inconsistency of this movie, almost left me brain dead, this movie was in my words ""disgusting"" the scenes change suddenly, they are very predictable and you will find yourself screaming on the loopholes and flaws in almost every scene, one of the examples is, in the beginning an Indian girl is speaking English, yet she's understanding what one of the man present in the room who speaks Mandarin, then the guy understands her, yet when they spoke to each other they speak in different languages, and they both appear to not understand each other. so this was just plain trash.on the other hand typical Jackie Chan action scenes are guaranteed, but the movie was bad enough that although I am a hardcore Jackie Chan fan I couldn't bear anymore of this."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"The movie looks like a mix of good parts of several movies. The mixed could have been good with good script and concentration on cast's acting. There are scenes that are just thrown into the movie, like they are all needed for a treasure hunt movie. Graphics needed a lot of improvement. They are not at the scale someone excepts from a bi-national or a international movie."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Kung Fu Yoga"" (NR - 2017 - Netflix)Genre: Action/Martial/ComedyMy Score: 5.2Cast=4 Acting=3 Plot=7 Ending=2 Story=5Violent=5 Pace=6 F/X=5 Fights=8 Funny=7Two professors team up to locate a lost treasure and embark on an adventure that takes them from a Tibetan ice cave to Dubai, and to a mountain temple in India.""Eighteen kicks to tame the tiger...from India!"" This is really low rent for a Jackie Chan film. The fight scenes were good and it was funny...that's what you'd come to expect. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there...especially with an ending that may have not been expected but definitely not wanted. I am a huge Jackie Chan fan, but even I shouldn't have seen this one."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Trying to make a cross-culture film with the Indian and Chinese cast is appreciable but other than the actors there's not much Indian involvement and that can be seen. The ending musical number akin to a Bollywood dance in Chinese looks weird for both Indian and Chinese audience, they could've hired some people from India if the wanted a Bollywood dance look like one instead of a goofy imitation. Also, I don't understand why Indian actresses are trying to act in a Chinese way. Jackie Chan's love for Indiana Jones is seen in a lot of films which is also continued here. With a lot of exotic locations across Asia and a lot of scenes involving animals from Lions and Hyenas to snakes, this is a non-stop action comedy. Much of the film can be enjoyable due to its lack of seriousness yet the silliness is too much."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This is China's answer to Indian Jones films and spoofs the production in several scenes except it lacks freaking aliens. The film opens with CG action where the ""Monkey King"" leaves off. In 647 AD China assists the rightful government of India against a hostile General with elephants. After a battle that gave me LOTR flashbacks, the Chinese are rewarded with treasure and gets lost in a snow storm on the way back.We then turn to modern times where Jackie Chan, China's greatest archaeologist and an infinity plus one black belt has created a device to reconstruct the original color of ancient items by reading the residue of chemicals/minerals left behind. He is approached by head turner Ashmita (Disha Patani) of India who has a map and needs Jack to help locate the lost treasure of Magadha. Jack enlists the help of tomb raider and treasure hunter Jones Lee(Aarif Rahman) who is also his nephew. There appears to be a romance somewhere and some jealousy but as in so many Chinese films, they don't know how to develop it beyond glances. A bad guy (Sonu Sood) shows up descendant of the original bad guy to provide us with an antagonist who can also do Bollywood line steps. The film is divided into two halves, each with its own treasure but same characters. While the humor is mostly slapstick with the aging Chan, I loved the bridge crossing Indie spoof scene. Jaguars are out, Ferraris are in the Dubai Fast and Furious scenes.Guide: I heard ones use of s***. Girls in bikini. Some ogling."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,I looked forward to watching this film as it was partially filmed locally in Dubai but sorry Jackie this film was a mega-cheesy disaster.The characters are 1 dimensional and acting is dreadful its more like a live action cartoon than a grown-up feature film. The villain is ridiculous and the obligatory song and dance scene was the final straw.Please don't wast your time doing another Chindian movie
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,To watch this is waste of time. Even I could not see the full movie because no story not specific action not a food cast......forcefully inserting action stunts.....
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Always been a big fan of Jackie Chan's movies. Grew up watching almost all his movies and re-watched some over and over again. Unfortunately watching this felt like mental torture and I have to agree with most others who gave bad reviews. Jackie's performance was great but the movie was just not good. The good: Jackie Chan's acting is great as always. Considering his age, knock on wood he's amazing! Good plot with potential and great locations. The bad: other than Jackie, the rest of the main characters were horrible actors. The so called ""Dr."" didn't fit the role at all. It was annoying to keep hearing ""oh wow"", ""sweeet"", etc.. with a thick Indian accent over and over again as if she just walked into a shopping mall. After reading the plot on Netflix, I was expecting something on par with ""The librarian"" for an instance. But the acting was a complete turn off. If you are a Jackie Chan fan, better off watching his other movies because this isn't doing him any justice."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Not really my type of movie, but I had to accompany someone to watch this. The story isn't all that great, as it is quite predictable, and the characters themselves are quite shallow. The kung-fu part takes up the majority of the movie, which is no surprise. However, the 'yoga' aspect of it isn't so much there in the literal sense. I gather that the 'yoga' was just there as a nudge to the joining of the Chinese-Indian cultures and stars. Jackie Chan plays mostly the same roles in movies like these, and he's OK for the most part. He has earnest expressions, but I feel pretty neutral when it comes to him. I neither like or dislike him, and he is still able to perform stunts pretty well. Other cast members did their parts well enough, and the story was easy to follow along with. However, Patani, Dastur, and Muqi all look like participants in beauty pageants, a very specific type of female casting going on in this film. Zhang as well is a member of K-pop group EXO-M, which is the Chinese sub-group of EXO, and Rahman (Almost Malaysian represent!) and Sood, also all look like they can be in various modelling competitions. Not unpleasing to the eye, but the lack of diversity (in regards to looks) make this movie seem quite fake.In addition to that, I am unsure if this happens to all Chinese made films, however, there always seems to be trouble with audio syncing. Not only do voice speeches sound unnatural (too smooth), the rhythm and timing of the speech in accordance with the mouth motion is out of sync. This happens throughout the whole movie, and is very disconcerting to watch. You can tell that the audio itself is not taken at the same time as the video filming. As well, while the story itself isn't very engaging, it can be forgiven given the genre of the movie. However, the script is quite poorly written as there are many instances of abrupt changes in topic. What's more, a lot of the time there is no flow in the way the conversation progresses. A person would say one thing, and then the other person would respond by saying something that doesn't seem to relate to what the first person actually said. But after awhile, the conversation kind of circles back, which is quite an odd way to hold conversations. One thing that I enjoyed in the film, was the landscapes. Some are obviously green screens - or maybe they all were, but they give off the intended effect. There was no problem with diversity in landscapes. Cinematography wasn't bad either. And there were some successful comedic scenes, mainly to do with a lion.Overall, a plain story with unsettling audio, but great scenery."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Jackie Chan plays Jack, and Kung Fu Yoga is fun and light-hearted. Sure, it has a healthy dose of unrealism that would make any reasonable person cringe, but hey, it's a lot of fun. In a world of grimness and violence and all that and American politics since the 2016 presidential election, Kung Fu Yoga is a fantastic movie that brings Jackie to India.The final scene was moving, with Jackie leading a Bollywood dance number of the whole cast. Kind of reminded me of the finale in Slumdog Millionaire. Jai Ho!There are no Jackie Chan stunt outtakes unfortunately, but still, the final dancing scene was worth the price of admission for sure. Hopefully there can be a sequel to Kung Fu Yoga, set in one of the many empty and defunct shopping malls in India. Why are the shopping malls defunct? Perhaps it's the hard truth. Middle class Indians want the best for the lowest price. Malls in Mulund and Thane for instance are too much for the folk there if you know what I mean."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This film is quite possibly one of the worst ever created. The story is non-sensical and often seems written last-minute to fit around whatever nonsense or unnecessary stunt the producer and 'star' Jackie Chan wanted to include at that moment. Some reviews seem to praise the cinematography, however I saw no discernible skill either behind or in front of the camera. The acting is dreadful, even below amateur level for the most part, and the editing is just as atrocious, hindered even further by cheap gags and untidy special effects and cgi that often sticks out like a sore thumb even in this catastrophic attempt. The film may see various exotic locations over the course of its painful 107 minute run-time, however even that potential positive only serves to make the actual film and everything else about it seem even worse in comparison. One particular scene involving a car chase sums up this film; overly long, choppily edited, terribly acted (Chan's constant indistinctive wailing especially) and awful special effects (numerous virtually cartoon-level animation cars flip unnecessarily, as well as an unexplained and unneeded clearly and poorly animated lion). Save yourself the time and don't watch."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,Its hard chances that Chinese and Indian Food can go along side. Like food this movie is also kind of mixture of actors from India and China which never blended to each other.They try to link some history in the movie with useless links and unwanted drama. It was better i watched it on TV then going to Cinema else I would had left with in 1 HOURS. Better use your time to watch other good movie rather than this. And I dont know why people are giving 8 star-9 stars for this. This is FLOP !!
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"What a fun movie! Similar to the Indiana Jones franchise and National Treasure, it follows an archaeologist and his treasure hunting nephew as they track down a centuries-old artifact. Why is it called Kung Fu Yoga, you might wonder? Because the beautiful Disha Patani is an experience yogi who recommends deep breathing to help swim underwater in a cave. That's pretty much it; but despite its innocuous title, you've got to rent this movie.Disha is a professor from India who hears about Professor Jackie Chan's archaeological discovery. She turns a few heads when she walks in the room, including Jackie's assistant, Yixing Zhang - much to the chagrin of another assistant, Miya Muqi, who's had her eye on Yixing for quite a while. The group is joined by Jackie's well-connected and wealthy pal, Eric Tsang, and his nephew, Aarif Rhaman, as they travel around the world to an underwater ice cave. Aarif is handsome and charming, but he's also a bit of a bad boy - he doesn't want to help his uncle recover the treasure; he wants the treasure for himself. And with Sonu Sood, an actual bad guy, on their tail, who will get to it first?If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. This is a non-stop adventure, whether the gang is traveling, fighting, or participating in a camel race. They even manage to make a mundane art auction exciting! Although it is absolutely impossible to swim through glacial waters without any covering on your face (and therefore allowing the water to permeate through the rest of your wetsuit), it's still very fun. There are chase scenes on the freeway, in a grand Dubai hotel, and through an Indian bazaar - complete with fire eaters and snake charmers. There's even a tongue-in-cheek compliment to Indiana Jones, as Jackie lets light filter through a crystal for a magical message and admits he loves the Harrison Ford franchise.Though it's not always easy to remember Jackie Chan was technically retired when he made this action packed film, he does allow the supporting cast to join in on the dangerous stunts and martial arts (especially Aarif, who previously played Bruce Lee in a 2010 movie). Jackie still keeps up with everyone, running, jumping, tumbling, and even doing upside down pushups - but thankfully, not risking his life. The lion in the backseat is computer generated. There are tons of very impressive special effects throughout the movie, so if you like flashy films, you'll like this one.However, by far the best part of the movie is the Bollywood dance number. I won't spoil anything by telling you when it is, but it is just delightful. It's no surprise that Jackie is a good dancer, since he's been a choreographer (of action scenes) for decades - but it's so cute to see him hopping around and smirking at the camera. If you like this one, check out The Medallion, Chinese Zodiac, and The Myth, three other Jackie movies that have an ancient artifact theme.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The opening historical sequence is full of camera swerves, swoops, and zooms, and that will make you sick. There are a few more unexpected camera moves throughout the film, but if you really want to watch it, fast-forward the first five minutes and you'll be in better shape. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"What is this? No real depiction of Indian culture, no sense of geographical diversite India has, and highly made up sets and locations. Just worst of everything ."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I love Jackie Chan and cannot believe he is still doing this sort of movie at his age. He is a living legend, an often used term that actually applies where he is concerned.Now for this movie .. what can I say? Well to be positive there are lots of good Jackie moments, mainly his amazing Kung Fu mixed with his excellent comedy timing. The scenery is great and some of the cast were not too bad.I think where this movie missed the mark was that it appeared rushed and disjointed. The story, right out of Indiana Jones, which Jackie alludes to for comedic effect, was OK but the ending was incredibly silly. I would have preferred if the Bollywood dance was an extra rather than the actual ending.Disha Patani,Amyra Dastur and Miya Muqi are all gorgeous and made parts more watchable. Sonu Sood was not convincing at all.The fight scenes and car chases were also overly long and too much reliance on CGI which Jackie really doesn't need."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Ddnt expect a masterpiece, ddnt get one. But ii was a fine effort by all. Jackie Chans movies were intense to begin and moved to simpler fun movies which we all enjoyed. This one stays there. Has its flaws and wtf moments, the end almost had me in splits....how does a fight culminate into THAT !But it still entertained me. Go in expecting a light, fun filled, action comedy, typical JC and it wont let you down."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I don't get the haters on this one. I totally loved this movie! I wished it didn't have to end. This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie so far. I really loved the story and it's ties to history. I especially loved the beginning with it's animation - it looked almost totally real. A very colorful movie with all kinds of different types of humor. I also liked the message about preserving history and how the value in ""treasure"" is much more than monetary. I thought it was a great touch to have the traditional Bollywood dance at the end of it. I absolutely loved it!"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This script just replaces the country in batches. Even if it's the New Year's File that cheats the box office, please use snacks."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Influenced by bad reviews and low score, I had been avoiding this movie until I gave it a chance in a night that no movie seemed to suit.Beautiful scenery and unblemished faces kept me watching with joy.Cgi was not perfect and some of the script was meretricious, aiming only to please they eye. However there were more than a few intense moments, some of which could fit in the Fast & Furious franchise. On the opposite of FF, characters (among which I would like to see Jackie some day), the protagonists neither get dirty, nor hurt, despite all the fighting. It is a rich spectacle certainly aimed at family audiences. It is a classic Jackie Chan adventure movie trying to find a reason to melt with Bollywood.Seen through a new prism, I appreciate better what Jackie is trying to do. Not only a profitable business, but ethical as well broadening my horizons and encouraging me to research Bollywood movies. I hope in the future he will do more mixed-culture movies and maybe one that will show my country Greece.I will definitely try to find more of his movies like this"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Actually very fun.Just treasure hunting. Indiana Jones knockoff. Morality lecture about knowledge over money.Good fights, even from Chan. A fun car chase through Dubai, although looked CGI in many instances. CGI tiger and hyenas: Meh.I'd guess it helped to have one of Chan's repeat directors from the '90s, Stanley Tong.Then a musical number suddenly at the end. WTF? It was set in India, though."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,Kung Fu Yoga has a little if fun stuff in it. But it also suffers from a great deal of dull and/or extraneous filler (who thought watching camels race until they foam at the mouth was entertaining?). Almost half an hour goes by before there's any action at all and half the movie has passed before there's any of Chan's classic comedy fight choreography.This film could have used some good old 90s miramax-styke editing. Hack away 15 minutes of boredom and you'd have a classic.
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,Lamest movie ever scene...I think the director got inspired by watching some pointless Bollywood flicks.Sonu just signed to this film to act with Jackie Chan it seems. But for Kids sure they will enjoy.But overall Lame
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"The whole film no laugh Chaqi the bursting point, India actress Chinese dubbing can really advance laid off, plus a fresh barrage --- really love Zhang Yixing, fans say what adorable? I only see first words.In our China here, won the 1 billion 700 million box office, I believe, so ugly why won the next 1 billion 700 million?! Really do not understand Goo.Chinese Spring Festival stalls to see this movie, no brain ending, embarrassing plot, not happy!!"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"This was out of the Box, but the first try is always not so good.. So the selection of actors was in adequate, direction was inadequate. But this should not be the end at all.. There is a perfect way and we just need to figure it out..Jackie chan definitely need some similar energy and suitable actors like Tiger shroff, Vidyut Jamwal, and probably hrithik roshan.. The movies like Baghi and other indian action films made on a large scale does need someone like Jackie chan to enhance the film .. Now Bollywood has started investing big into epic and action films, so why not take legendary actors like Jackies chan, or Dwayne johnson (Rock) to woo the audience and make real deal entertainment.."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,The final dancing scene is absolutely amazing.The movie itself is childish and entertaining. Watch it and have a good time.
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Extremely boring movie. It's duplicate movie. Waste of time. Don't know how Jackie chain signed this movie. It's completely in Chinese. Don't feel like to watch more than 5 minutes. Watch ""The great wall - 2016"" ""The Call"" Pakistani Movie ""Dukhatr""If you are Bollywood lover watch ""The Ghazi Attack"" ""Lion"" ""Rangoon"""
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I'll have to agree with many other reviews here, this is really by far not Jackie's best.The characters are unbelievable shallow, the acting like some cheap TV production - even Jackie usually acts better than that - , the CGI is on early 2000s TV level, the use of it is plain bizarre too... you managed to get two Indian actresses for your movie, but the ancient Indian queen in the beginning sequence needed to be CGI for some reason?!! Allover even the earliest Jackie Chan movies were of higher allover quality as this one. Fans are bound to feel let down by this. As a Jackie Chan movie it is a total train wreck.To me there are two major theories how this piece must have come about:A: A Chinese funded propaganda piece that doubles as a tourism advertisement (you do get to see beautiful shots of current in travel locations).B: Some money had to be laundered somehow... some people open a sports betting shop for the purpose... some open a car wash... some make moviesSo why was it still worth 5 stars to me? Well, yeah, even if I also felt a bit let down being a Jackie Chan fan since the 80s, I cannot say that it was the worst movie ever. The story telling may be rushed and uninspired, but it never gets boring. There are plenty of nice shots from around the world and there is some comedy in the action scenes (for what it's worth, first time I saw a CGI lion puke).It's sure no movie highlight, but it makes for 2 hrs of ok entertainment while ironing your clothes or something like that."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Kind of disappointed lately too many china legend actors stared in suck movies,such as this one Bad CGI,Bad Storyplot Really i can imagine the actors/actresses feels like stupid when they watch this Budgets for this movie actually pretty moderate,but what i don't understand is why they cant hire someone who really good at CGI, First battle scene with CG looks like game trailer or something its totally outdated,if you want to create CGI scene at least do it like final fantasy xv"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I have watched this movie because of Aarif Rahman lee. Recently I have watched his drama ""princess of china"" and I liked him so much there couldn't stop myself from watching this movie. Honestly this movie has disappointed me on a great deal. I mean what Jackie Chan was thinking before doing the movie in this 21th century. This movie can be called a poor remake of Indiana Jones because it was constantly reminding me of Indiana Jones and the temple of doom. That movie had so much more to give even if in that century. Now it comes to the acting of Kung Fu Yoga. Jackie Chan was good in his comic role. Few of jokes was actually humorous but most of them were not. Disha looked stunning in her Indian costume but sadly she was looking like the daughter of Jackie Chan. So I won't say they were a good pair. Aarif Lee's character was clueless weather he was good or bad and in the end why he was good all of a sudden, it was just stupid. There were no chemistry build ups between the three pairs which could have attract the viewers. Then I found it really stupid when Disha steals the diamond and returns to India. And when Jackie Chan comes to find her there she says ""this was the only way to bring Jackie Chan in India."" I mean for god sake the jewel was the key to open the gate from a temple in India. If he is an archaeologist why wouldn't he come? Or couldn't she invite him directly in Dubai after getting the diamond? While they were already working together? Another big disappointment was Sonu Sood's acting. When I was watching Indiana Jones the temple of doom it clearly had the best villain of India (Amrish Puri) of all time. His dialogues and actions was so filthy and scary it would actually make you hate Amrish Puri when Sonu Sood sound like a joker when he delivered his dialogues like ""I am the government"" and etc. The biggest disappointment was the ending. Though there were some enjoyable moments in the action and Kung Fu scenes but ending was pretty bad. I mean I felt like it ended from nowhere. Everything resolves all of a sudden, bad guys turns out good guys and they start dancing like a fairy tale? (What the hell!!!) Couldn't the director think of any better ending? How much money has he put on to make this disappointing movie? If anything was better than it was the expensive cars and the dance moves in the last song."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I am not sure what some people expect from a Jackie Chan movie. If you see the end of some of his movies...the entire cast doing a group dance...you KNWO he's just doing this for fun. Plus I noticed a LOT of young actors in his film so I think he's giving them valuable experience. /rantYes, IT HAS few problems as a movie....but don't they all? Rather than dwell on that.... I'll tell ya why you should want to watch it. Jackie Chan. Right? The cast is young and beautiful. The cinematography and locations are gorgeous. It's a great Weekend night adventure....if you et al can do subtitles. Which on Amazon is small and quick. Note: I prefer subtitles to preserve the culture and performance. I hate bad overdubs.Like almost any action adventure movie....just sit back with drink of choice and snacks and enjoy the fun. There are worse ways to waste movie night."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Good, basically clean fun. Entertaining movie, good fight scenes, visually gorgeous. CGI is pretty noticeable but a fun movie with a fun Bollywood ending."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Have you ever wanted to watch a movie where all the actors have the same horrible dead-pan delivery of Jackie Chan? Except, you also wanted to remove the comedic part of him, and instead try to make it multi- faceted with ""romance""/random sexualization of the female characters?Then this is the movie for you!The movie's single redeemable point is it's attempt to fuse the use of multiple languages (Chinese, English, Hindi (?) ++), and I think that's something we could learn from.However, the rest of the movie is extremely bland, and the ""comedic"" situations often have no setup to them at all. You simply have to suspend your consciousness to view this without cringing. The battle sequences are very often drawn out too long, making them lose their usual Jackie Chan flair.Most of the actors are likely stunt-men first, and actors second. This shows A LOT in their performance.I found very little to enjoy here, and the only reason I watched through it was because I was stuck on a plane."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"Critics without sense of Humor will tell you that this is worst movie ever. I will tell you to stop listening others even my self and see for your self! Movie has amazing unique sense of humor and is very refreshing to see.Jackie Chan representing him self as little man and using his gags to make you laugh, which is always welcomed as is the movie!I know i had some wonderful laugh"
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"I rarely write reviews.... But this movie is so unique I had to.First off, I'm a big Jackie Chan fan. I've been watching his movies since I was a kid, my late Great Grandfather and I loved watching them together. I prefer his early Hong Kong films to his American films.That being said, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is the most disjointed pile of crap I have ever seen. If you titles this ""Kung Fu Discombobulation"" it would be more fitting.It's like an attempt to embrace 2 cultures.I can best describe it as:Michael Bay meets horrible CGI meets Jackie Chan meets Beowulf meets National Treasure meets the Lion King meets Indiana Jones meets Bollywood.Spoiler:At the very end, they stop mid-fight, and then breakout into a dance. Literally dancing with the guy who's been trying to kill him 😂.Apparently that's a Bollywood thing to dance in films from what I'm reading?So despite the opening Horrible Cartoon CGI, showing off Kung Fu to Attacking Wolves (who run from snow balls.... We have over a foot of snow here, my dogs love catching Snowballs, the wolves were more likely to catch them and play than run away from snow balls).... The CGI in the car chase was horrible. Actually all the CGI was awful other than the hyenas which somehow looked okay.One minute Jack(ie) beats up bad guys, the next he's captured. Enter a beautiful and super long underwater swimming scene. Way too many overly long chases and fights (hindered by CGI instead of quality wirework).I'm making this sound like one of the most horrible movies ever, which script wise it was...... but somehow despite that, It was so horrible it was good 🤣. Even laughed a few times. It was an enjoyable film.Maybe that's just because every main female character in it was beyond gorgeous.PS. Not going to lie. That dance at the end was really good."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,Good story line and wonderful message. Can definitely watch with kids
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"If you do not speak Mandarin, I would avoid renting this from Amazon. There were no subtitles and I found it difficult to follow. The main plot where there is inter action between the Indian and the Chinese is in English, but without the subtitles, it is hard to follow the by play from the other characters."
功夫瑜伽,Kung Fu Yoga (2017),,2017,2017.01.27,"It's a well produced blockbuster designed to rake in $$ in India and China. What did you expect for this kind of big budget collaboration? An artsy plot with a startling twist? Oscar worthy performance in an action comedy? Character development for the entire cast of 10? They can't afford to offend anyone and they have to have something in it for the whole family. Nothing is good enough for internet trolls these days. The CGI at the beginning was super-cringe worthy. But I enjoyed myself for the rest of the movie. It' got everything although the India scenes are so cliche. No shortage of Indiana Jones adventure homages, a Supercar chase in Dubai with a lion in the back of Jackie Chan' SUV, and hilarious fight sequences. Even with a pack of hyenas. Yeah it's ridiculous but it's entertaining, isn't that the point of watching a movie? To be entertained?"
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Right, well with two of the heavy weights of Hong Kong cinema coming together in this movie, then what could go wrong?I had not actually heard about ""Chasing the Dragon"" (aka ""Chui lung"") prior to stumbling upon it by sheer luck. I didn't even had to read the synopsis for it; I saw that it was a Hong Kong movie and it had both Andy Lau and Donnie Yen on the cover. This was an instant pick-up.The movie turned out to be quite entertaining, and it is one of the better orchestrated gangster movies that I have seen in quite some time.The storyline was good, fast-paced and nicely written. And the fact that the characters were so well detailed and unique also helped to make the movie experience that much better. Of course, having an amazing cast to portray these characters just helped the movie along all the more.Donnie Yen was good in the role as an immigrant turned criminal in order to make a living in Hong Kong, and Andy Lau is, as always, doing a great job in a police role. Needless to say that both their performances were phenomenal. But the movie also boasted other quite interesting supporting actors. If you are familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you will definitely see some familiar faces - some of them even in small roles that weren't that important to the movie.""Chasing the Dragon"" was nicely paced and it didn't really have a dull moment throughout the course of its story. That worked quite nicely in favor of the movie.If you enjoy Asian cinema, or Hong Kong cinema in particular, then you should take the time to sit down and watch ""Chasing the Dragon""..."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Just when you've come to hate him more than love him for truly frustrating duds such as 'From Vegas to Macau 3' and 'Mission Milano', Hong Kong's most prolific filmmaker Wong Jing compels you to take him seriously once again with the best gangster drama we've seen in a long while.Written, produced and co-directed by Wong Jing, his latest period epic charts the rise and fall of two of Hong Kong's most infamous real- life characters from the 60s and 70s – the one-time most powerful drug lord in Hong Kong Ng Sik-ho (or better known as 'Crippled Ho') and the notoriously corrupt detective Lui Lok (or otherwise known as 'Lee Rock'). Perhaps because he had already previously told Lee Rock's story, Wong Jing anchors this movie around Sik-ho (Donnie Yen), who first steps foot in Hong Kong in 1960 as an illegal immigrant from Chaozhou with his three buddies (Philip Keung, Wilfred Lau and Kang Yu) and younger brother Peter (Jonathan Lee). Although engaged in odd jobs, the quartet find more lucrative means of employment by being paid to make up the numbers in street fights. One such fight is that purportedly between rivalling triad heads Comic (Jason Wong) and Grizzly Bear (Ricky Yi). Unfortunately, the fight turns ugly with the arrival of the riot police led by the British Superintendent Hunter (Bryan Larkin), and before the night is over, Sik-ho ends up in a run-in with the arrogant and supercilious 'gwei-lo'.All that is witnessed by Lee Rock (Andy Lau) and his right-hand man Piggy (Kent Cheng), who spies Sik-ho's superior fighting skills and decides to recruit him and his buddies while they are in lock-up. As circumstances would have it, in order to save one of his buddies caught stealing from mafia boss Bro Chubby (Ben Ng), Sik-ho will end up working too for the former, running his drug business within the legendary Kowloon Walled City. It is within this hotbed of lawlessness that Lee will venture into one day. Things go south obviously, and the subsequent turn of events binds Sik-ho and Lee in a complex brotherhood embrace – Sik-ho springs to Lee's rescue but ends up caught in the crosshairs of another parallel ambush sprung by Sir Ngan in collusion with Chubby. In the ensuing scuffle, Chubby breaks Sik-ho's right leg as punishment, thus birthing a hardened and even more driven 'Crippled Ho' upon his discharge from hospital.Sik-ho's transformation comes at the midway point, and it is in the second hour that he truly comes into his own. Not only does he resist Lee's manoeuvres to alter the state of play, Sik-ho takes matters into his own hands against Lee's better advice in order to exact his own vendetta against Superintendent Hunter. There is a lot of plot crammed into a slightly-past-two-hour runtime, but its machinations consistently revolve around the dynamic between Sik-ho and Lee; an especially poignant scene near the end has a visibly embittered Sik- ho pointing out squarely to Lee the personal costs and consequences of the latter's actions over the decade plus on the both of them, and the duo coming to recognise how little of life, death, or anything in between they can truly control.Oh yes, the movie is equal parts plot and character-driven, and Wong Jing's (rare) achievement is how he balances both perfectly to deliver a sprawling but constantly spellbinding account of the fates and fortunes of his two key male protagonists. Due credit also goes to his co-director cum director-of-photography Jason Kwan, who not only brings a vivid cinematic feel to the visuals but also imposes rigour in crafting and building up several pivotal sequences, both of which are too often lost on a frequently sloppy Wong Jing.More prominently, 'Chasing the Dragon' has been sold as a showcase of Donnie Yen's acting chops, and sure enough, Yen doesn't disappoint; in fact, as Sik-ho, Yen probably makes the most significant breakthrough of his career since 'Ip Man'. His portrayal of Sik-ho is understated, nuanced and impressively authentic, especially in depicting his character's transformation from underdog to kingpin. Yen and Lau don't share as many scenes together as we'd have liked, but the duo have great chemistry when they do, embodying the genuine camaraderie between their characters as well as the seeds of distrust, suspicion and resentment sowed by their own respective ambitions, egos and greed. It should also be said that this gangster tale is always careful not to glorify its socially deviant protagonists – principally for fear of running afoul of Chinese censors – and is therefore less unhinged than the early 90s flicks of Sik-ho and/or Lee. In fact, Yen and Lau aren't playing so much criminals as they are anti-heroes, so not only are there redeeming qualities about their characters in this movie, both will come in an epilogue set thirty years later to realise and regret the folly of their ways. Yet these politically (and commercially) savvy considerations aside, Wong Jing's latest is still a solid and solidly entertaining example of the genre that is bloody, violent and thrilling.Indeed, there is much to enjoy in this period gangster epic, from the storytelling to the characters to the actors and as well to the richly detailed sets of Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai and Kowloon Walled City. This dragon is one you won't mind chasing from start to finish, and we guarantee you it will leave you on a visceral high."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Obviously, the movie ""Chasing the Dragon"" is not a remake of the 1991 movies ""Lee Rock"" and ""To be Number One"". Instead, it borrows their main protagonists and antagonists, and tells a completely different story. In some sense, ""Chasing the Dragon"" is a reboot of the gangster epics.The production design, music score, action sequences and acting performances are most notably brilliant. The action sequences are unexpectedly brutal and bloody, and really stun me from time to time. Donnie Yen has long established himself as one of the best martial artists of all time, and here in ""Chasing the Dragon"" he gives an almost career-best emotional performance, even better than that in ""Rogue One"". The acting of Andy Lau, Kent Tong, Kent Cheng, and Ben Ng is fantastic as always. On the other hand, the plot and the editing are not satisfying. Wong Jing is not a talented filmmaker. Some scenes simply lack consistency and credibility. In a nutshell, the rating for this movie is 7/10."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Chasing the Dragon is a Chinese crime drama film directed by Wong Jing and stars Donnie Yen and Andy Lau. When I first heard about the movie in production last year, a biopic based off the true story of infamous crippled Hong Kong gangster Ng Sek Ho, I thought it was a strange choice to have a world-renowned action star like Donnie Yen play him. Not that he is a bad actor or anything, but Yen is more famous for his karate chops than his acting chops. So who in their right minds would cast him as a handicapped character, essentially immobilizing and disallowing him to what he does best? Equally peculiar of a choice is Wong Jing as the director of the film. I felt his slapstick humor and sloppy storytelling would conflict with the overall serious tone intended for the movie. Coming out of the theater, I felt Donnie Yen is once again the best thing about a movie featuring him, but unfortunately Wong Jing's amateurish direction ruins everything just about everything else.Donnie Yen plays Ho, an illegal mainland Chinese immigrant in Hong Kong. His character is very sympathetic, as he is family man looking after his people, earning 10 Hong Kong dollars a night as a street fighter. Here he gives the best performance I have ever seen and I really enjoyed his character, I felt he was able to channel between different emotions and display empathy, sympathy, loyalty and relentlessness. While he is probably not going to win an Oscar in February, he did go above and beyond his usual spectrum. The Chaozhou accent and language he used was very good and along with the excellent costumes and set design of 1960's Hong Kong, giving the film an overall authentic feel.Where Chasing the Dragon really failed however was the storytelling, particularly as it relates to the editing and pacing. The movie starts out very simple and easy to follow, but soon expands unnecessarily to convoluting proportions with subplots of different crime bosses and corrupt officials I did not really care about. One of the worst piece of editing I have ever seen was a tragic sequence that bookends the first act. The scene was supposed to make you feel emotional and wrecked, but it just made me roll my eyes the entire time. I felt really annoyed because story-wise, the tragedy made very little sense for us to feel sad since we do not even know who the character is, but the technical execution of the scene was even worse. The film then transitions months ahead into the story and at that point, it had no idea what it wanted to focus on. Was it his love for his brothers? His friendship with Andy Lau? His mourning of his family? His desire to rise to the top? No, the film touches upon everything only slightly, but never truly exploring any of it in great details. Any of important plot points were montaged through quickly, with the director expecting the audience to know the true backstory to fill in the gaps. Instead of seeing Ho earning his power, we just see things getting handed to him. What exactly has he done except being a good fighter and a loyal friend to deserve all the accolades? Another big issue I have is the final 20 minutes, which pertains a subplot that blows up and becomes the main plot and the whole movie then turns into a revenge fantasy for no reason at all, because the writers said so.My initial trepidation of Donnie Yen playing a crippled character, hindering his ability to perform his trademark moves was right on point. Donnie's acting was good, but because for half the movie he can barely walk, he is utterly wasted nonetheless. Simply put Chasing the Dragon is not an action movie, so if you go in expecting Ip Man quality fight scenes, you will be sorely disappointed. There are few hand to hand action scenes in the first half, but even those were poorly done by Donnie Yen standards. They were short, shaky and lack the oomph of a satisfying fight scene.Overall, I feel the movie failed to tell a compelling story with its cast and production value. Wong Jing was definitely a very poor choice of director, and it shows throughout. His style simply does not mesh well for the story content. Who is the movie made for? Action fans? The action is not very good. Crime drama fans? The drama is muddled with technical problems. While not a terrible movie, the only good reason to watch it is two words: Donnie Yen."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"There are many things I can't fault the movie for - it has excellent action, tension and details in the historical setting. However, there are just far too many characters. It felt like a mess and it was hard to keep track."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"With a script this complex, spanning the rise and life of the main character from poor street fighter to druglord, it almost felt like they were going for a Scarface-level epic. but instead of developing realistic characters they used caricatures - the British villain felt particularly bogus - and unrealistic scenarios, such as large groups of people brawling in the streets with sticks and saucepans, who all happen to be amazing at martial arts. Perhaps having a main character who is too good at martial arts distracts from the biographical, historical tale.Tries to walk a balance between a heartfelt historical drama and an action movie. Didn't really work for me"
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Andy Lau in this film continued to play the role of Lee Rock, portraying his early rise in Hong Kong's police system under the colonial sovereign governing governing. Donnie Yen played a role as new comer and a new input of this Hong Kong generic and stereotyped underworld gangster who later associated himself and was manipulated by Lee Rock.What I don't like too much of this film are the usual fatal flaws that almost every Chinese movie would always be unavoidable:Lousy screenplay with horrible dialog, making this film so painful to swallow.Bad acting that included Any Lau and Donnie Yen. The overly weight control  diet has deformed Lau into a skinny physical body with gaunt skeleton face,  resulted him as a non-outstanding ordinary little guy without any special  dominant aura to support his upper-echelon status in any job title, police or  gangster organization. Any GREAT or POWERFUL role he played only gave  me an impression that movie needed to make him being that role. There's  not enough believability to convince me he could be that great or powerful  person in that movie so far.  Donnie Yen is no exception in this movie with very bad acting with his  bloated facial condition. He was also deeply affected by the bad screenplay  to play a convincing enough character.Bad casting with many unnecessary clowns and jerks roles, such as Kent  Cheng, who played the sidekick and yes-man of Lee Rock. But in Chinese  movie industries, returning favors or special relationship always needed to be  considered from the cash-cow production groups behind the scene. So  manuscripts would always have to be revised, added more unnecessary roles,  thus unavoidably messed up the films. This trend and must-do is a tumor, an  appendix that Chinese movie industries could never cut off clearly. Poor make-ups with funny wigs that included Donnie Yen's cosmetic extra  eye-lid liner surgeries and moving Botox on his face.Status-quo no brainer trademark directing. Jing Wong has produced and  directed so many similar genre film like this one. He never improved or  evovled his directing technique and skill at all. Every film he directed or  produced was almost the same, no new ground was ever broken. This film, in my opinion, is just another shallow farce with lot of back alley fights typically in Hong Kong gangster films. Donnie Yen has been trying very hard to make him not just a martial-art fighting machine in his films but an actor with more depth, but with only such lousy screenplays lying around, with his aging process, the only choice he could do is making money first with his fighting skills whenever big payloads throwing his way like Jackie Chan."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"A good drama of wonderful collaboration of Yen and Lau. Telling the fans about mafia and corrupt cops back then in Hong Kong is something.But definitely we may not find Yen's usual fighting scenes. As rumbles are here and there, we have seen how it is supposed to be by The Raid, so from that on, audience expect same thrill. But it is not. Yes this is not Yen's martial art film, but a brawl is always a brawl, should be depicted as real as possible. Using multi cameras and many takes like Hollywood does, would be better, to deliver the violence.I also have no idea, why smoking scenes have to be the way to show the brotherhood. It is too much. Sharing one cigarette is weird for all the wealth they possess eventually. Unless it has been a habit since they were zero. Sharing weed makes sense more, but I guess there is certain reason, just a cigarette not weed.My compliment is also for the western actors, they act so natural.One more thing, the reunion of actors from TVB Hong Kong 1980's, ""Kwee Cheng"", ""Ho Tu"", ""Oey Yok Soe"" and of course, ""Yo Ko"" himself, is quite a fun."

追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"I am remembering the days when i was watching at least 7-8 films from hong kong cinema each year and one or even two movies from these would have make my back-hair lift of excitement and awesomeness. But since 2008 or 2009 forward, i must say, the chinese/hong kong movie industry has become something without head and tale. The screenplays are at the lowest level of intelligence, the editing of every film is downright baaaad, they are trying so hard to copy american movies, that it makes me almost wanting to give up watching any movie from HK or the main land. Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen... it's been a decade since any of them had made a good movie (the last big HK movie beeing IpMan - first part from 2008). I am only hoping that someone will appear, someone new (a director and writer), although is hard; i think the audience in china is very uneducated and they love films that are so easy to swallow, and they are many, there strenght is in their numbers. But who knows, maybe with not so many money, but with conviction, a young writer/director will get his chance, you never know. Greetings from Bucharest, Romania! :)"

追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Chasing the Dragon is a gangster epic based upon real events that have inspired numerous similar movies in the past. It tells the rise and fall of Ho, an illegal immigrant to Hongkong who starts as a street fighter before his skills impress local police officer Lee Rock who gradually makes him a renowned boss of the underground. While his rise makes Ho a respected member of his community, he must fight ferocious opponents, loses many people around him and passionately hates the corrupt British police that is trying to control him.Chasing the Dragon convinces with profound real-life characters played by some of Hongkong's greatest contemporary actors such as Andy Lau and Donnie Yen. The movie focuses on character developments and tense rivalry between crime syndicates and police forces instead of gratuitous action sequences. That being said, the film still includes a few quite tense and brutal gunfights and wild chases that are used in small doses and offer welcome breaks from the dramatic dialogues. The locations are particularly interesting, leading us from crowded and poor suburbs or cheap bars and casinos to lush mansions and exotic locations in Thailand. The camera work is precise and easy to follow. The jazzy soundtrack complements the settings accurately. It's also refreshing that the movie doesn't involve any distracting subplots such as love stories and rather focuses on the love-hate relationship between two men and their immediate collaborators.Chasing the Dragon might not reinvent the gangster movie genre but it's among the best movies of its kind in recent memory. It's obvious that a lot of money, passion and thought was put into every single detail of this movie by the filmmakers, from the great set of casted actors over the realistic fight sequences to the choice of authentic locations. Fans of classic gangster movies such as The Godfather and the likes will certainly enjoy watching Chasing the Dragon."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"First, Donnie Yen interpretation here is even better than Yip Man movies.Second, the characterization of his character is pretty well executed and developed. He remembered me in some ways a Chinese version of Tony Montana in Scarface.Don't get me wrong Al Pacino's interpretation is two steps over Donnie's one, also the movie, but Chasing the Dragon is the best Chinese movie I've watched in a long time.So, overall this is great Chinese drug-thriller to enjoy during this long days."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"CHASING THE DRAGON is the latest in a long time of gangster-themed movies from the prolific Hong Kong director Wong Jing. It stars Donnie Yen and Andy Lau in the true story of Crippled Ho, a man who rose through the ranks to become one of the region's biggest drug lords in the 1960s and 1970s. The kind of format is familiar, this specific story not so much so, which makes it interesting and engaging in equal measure. Yen gets a handful of superb fight scenes to himself, ones which are more grittily realistic than most (think the influence of something like THE YELLOW SEA) but this is mostly about his acting and very good he is too. Lau plays a cop for the umpteenth time and can do this kind of role in his sleep by now. Jing allows supporting roles for veteran performers including Kent Cheng, Kenneth Tsang, and Michael Chan Wai-Man, all of whom shine, but what sees this film through is the stylish storytelling and wealth of plot movement to keep it going."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"After arriving illegally into Hong Kong from mainland China ""Crippled Ho"" (Donnie Yen) and his three friends hire themselves out as low-level street thugs to make a few bucks here and there. Then one night they find themselves in the middle of a riot and when the police arrive Ho defends his buddies but in the process gets into a major fight with a corrupt and pyscopathic British policeman named ""Ernest Hunt"" (Bryan Larkin). Although Ho gets the better of him in a fair fight he is arrested by a Chinese police officer named ""Lee Rock"" (Andy Lau) and taken to jail. Hours later Hunt arrives with a few British policemen and proceeds to beat Ho who is isolated and completely defenseless. Fortunately, Lee Rock arrives and stops Hunt before Ho can be killed and after he gets out of the hospital conveys his gratitude to Lee Rock. From this point on both Lee Rock and Ho become good friends and although Hong Kong itself is controlled by the corrupt British police, Kowloon is just the opposite and that is where the two of them decide to make their fortunes in the drug trade. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was an entertaining film which combined plenty of action with an interesting-if not entirely realistic-plot. But even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and have rated it accordingly. Above average."

This movie is easily the worst HK movie I have ever seen. There are many bad HK movies, but this movie beats them all. The ones at fault are obviously the director and writer.First off, the pacing is bad, really bad. There isn't proper introduction and characterization at all. We can hardly know anyone in the movie. They come and go as fast as the wind. When some names are mentioned in the movie, we can only roll our eyes and ask ""Who are they again??"" When some people die, followed by awful scream and cry and melancholy music, again we look at each other, roll our eyes and ask ""Who are those people anyway?"" It's true. Until the end, we don't really know they are, what are their relationship to the main character.After that there's nothing but going downhill. The movie keeps time skipping and nothing seems to be important. People die here and there, but excuse me, who are they anyway, and why should we care? They have only been introduced like, two minutes ago! And then end credit rolls..."

Interesting backstory - not the type of story the current Chinese regime would allow, given the violence portrayed. However, because the time period when all this was going on was during the British colonial times, and then it was ok because such violence was inspired by colonialism. Whatever. Lots of shooting and violence of all kinds."
追龙,Chasing the Dragon (2017),,2017,2017.09.29,"Very disappointing movie considering the big name cast.Everything from the props (weapons, slum set, cars, etc.) to Donnie Yen's wig is a massive distraction. They must have used the cheapest grade props known to the industry (you'll notice this in multiple scenes where's there's bottling/glass).The dialogues are predictable and cliche. All their portrayal of triads is something I'd expect from a Young and Dangerous film back in the 90s (much better films than this actually).The Western actors were also given horrible scripts. Some of their scenes made me question, did the film crew even watch their work after the takes?I normally don't get frustrated with these films because at least I get good action, but this very much a crime-drama with small parts of action (with almost no martial arts, so casting Donnie seemed like a waste).It seems the producer of this film is banking on stirring anti-colonialism to keep the audience entertained and had no intention on making an actual worth-while film."

The stunt work here is amazing to say the least! The sound effects, the tension, the adrenalin ... everything is working just fine here.There may be a little patriotism, but other than that ... also like with Wolf Warrior, it's not like we are not used to that from US/Hollywood output.

Thus, I would give the film a 8.5/10 overall rating. Similar to the Chris Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" and the action flick ""Operation Mekong"" in 2016, also directed by Dante Lam, this film ""Operation Red Sea"" sacrifices plot and character development for action, and fortunately it works. The cinematography, film editing, sound editing, sound mixing, visual effects, action choreography, original score and production design are just speechless. The film borrows ideas from several Hollywood blockbusters, such as the moral debate in ""Saving Private Ryan"", the special force fights of ""Black Hawk Down"", the war scenes at ""Hacksaw Ridge"", the tank battles from ""Patton"" and most importantly ""American Sniper""'s sniping sequences."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Operation Red Sea a.k.a Hong hai xing dong is an action war movie directed by Dante Lam and stars Zhang Yi, Huang Jingyu, Hai Qing, Du Jiang and Prince Mak.What a wonderful movie this has been, the perfect depiction of war scenes. The acting is strong and too the point. Screenplay is fast paced and gripping. War scenes are shot so beautifully that it looks real.The climax of the movie is also impressive and strong which gives you a feel good factor. The only drawback of the movie is the length as it sometime it seems that the movie is stretched unnecessarily long, however it might not be boring.An entertaining action war movie with a good climax and powerful visuals. A must watch for all the war movies lovers."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Those who thought the movie was pure war scene should watch the Pacific, which also solely described the war scene in WW2. You could feel it, you could see it, you could witness the brutality, you could be shocked by the reality, that's filming. You wanna see superhero killing thousands of bad guys without injury but do not want to face the terrible war that is going on in the Middle East. Those who thought it was propaganda should comment the same under the American Captain and under the First Blood. Biased eyes could not see the fair world."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Who'd have thought that the first live-action SPEC OPS action movie with realistic effects work would be made by China (starring their Navy SPEC OPS ""Sea Dragons"")? I guess I was wrong to think that without a rating-system, Chinese movies wouldn't dare to show anything -- it turns out that they have no qualms about showing everything (without lingering over it like Hollywood gore porn, of course) if the movie/genre was right... Featuring 5 main escalating missions/set-pieces -- which are always strongly grounded by detailed sniper tactics and expertly strung together with clear plot-points as well as characterizations -- all the usual Hollywood war/military movie ""fat"" (such as ""character arcs"", ""grand narratives"", ""social justice"" polemics, etc) has been trimmed off, so that military enthusiasts can simply immerse themselves in the gritty and heart-pounding SPEC OPS action.Just for its utter lack of pretension (to appear more ""balanced"", ""diverse"", profound"", etc.) -- 10/10, would BANG again!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"""Wolf Warrior 2"" is popular in the summer vacation, and madly swept more than 5 billion.But as long as you dare to say that it is not good at all, you will be besieged by brains, be greeted by your family, and even rise to an unpatriotic level.Everything is afraid of comparison. The advent of ""Operation of the Red Sea"" makes ""War Wolf 2"" look quite ridiculous in comparison, just like the children of kindergarten have played with each other.We would like to thank Director Lin Chaoxian, who proved how high Chinese military films can be, he improved our aesthetics, and he made us understand that War Wolf 2 is indeed not good enough."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Operation Red Sea is a Chinese big budget patriotic action film that is inspired by the highly successful Operation Mekong released two years earlier but follows a different set of characters in a different location. The story takes place on the Arabian peninsula where a group of terrorists overthrows a weak government. The People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces are given order to evacuate Chinese personnel and workers from the country. They must save a hostage from a heavily guarded terrorist stronghold. The group comes across an ambitious French-Chinese journalist who reveals that the terrorists plan to weaponize yellowcake materials into a dirty bomb. The military personnel must now save the hostage, protect the journalist and prevent the yellowcake materials to be delivered to the terrorists.This stunning movie convinces on numerous levels. The story isn't particularly imaginative but already more elaborate than similar American movies and comes around with a few interesting events and turns. The characters are attaching, diversified and unique as viewers will care about their fates. The realistic locations have been perfectly chosen and offer much diversity. The action scenes are among the most spectacular ones ever created. Especially the bloody showdown in the terrorist stronghold is absolutely breathtaking. The special effects are employed with care as the movie has a realistic touch. Despite a length of nearly two hours and a half, this film never gets boring and convinces from start to finish. Even the deleted scenes adding more information about the lead characters are sympathetic and could have been included in the original movie without making things redundant at all. While many similar Chinese movies are a little bit too patriotic, this one here focuses on the story, locations and characters which makes it more diversified.If you like action movies, you should definitely watch Operation Red Sea that offers some of the very best fight scenes ever created in the history of cinema. As if this weren't enough, the movie convinces with an above average story, sympathetic characters and gripping tension that will keep you hooked for nearly two and a half hours. While American cinema led the world with action franchises such as Rambo four decades ago, the best action franchises these days seem to come from China and deserve more international attention and acclaim."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Overtly nationalistic military propaganda film if I've ever seen one. Similar to ones produced by others such as in the old Germany; Soviet/Russia; US, and so on. If you want to see an exaggerated version of your own country's image creation propaganda this film is the model. Film location is not a real country, but harkens back to a hostage situation in Yemen several years ago where Chinese warships evacuated Chinese and other nationalities. Anyway, it's basically two plus hours of one fire fight after another with no weapon left out. Drones, helicopters, warships, snipers, tanks and more. The terrorist bad guys are portrayed as really bad in counterpoint to the angelic Chinese. Now if only China would fight equally hard to give democracy a chance. Even the closing credits had a message addressed to Chinese nationals living in any country to call the listed Chinese Foreign Service numbers if they feel in danger. Watch out Canada & Iceland & New Zealand, etc."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"If you are interested in a fair war movie with tons of action, lots of interesting military equipment, and some gore, this is for you.There is a pretty huge cast of characters, and since most wear drab clothing or military uniforms it is not always easy to keep them separate, but on the other hand you can just remember Chinese = Good and keep it straight.The Chinese military is portrayed as high tech which I guess is fair, because this isn't their military as a whole but a small elite group. Special effects are quite good and some aspects of warfare are gotten right, which are often bungled by western war movies. For instance, a mortar attack is portrayed as the consuming terror that it is rather than a bunch of bloodless explosions.The gore is pretty shocking when it occurs (limbs blown off, etc.) but it is also not focused on. I quite enjoyed it."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie was actually better than I expected. Though not perfect, it provided a decent storyline and lots of action. It's definitely worth seeing at least once.I see some of the more critical reviewers saying how it is just Chinese propaganda. I would argue it's not much different than most of our American movies that display sacrifice and heroism (such as films like Act of Valor).Besides, the trivia section of this movie even states that this film was ""a gift for the 90th Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the Communist Party's 19th National Congress."" So what do you expect? And quite frankly, who cares if it's propaganda-like for the Chinese citizens?Give this movie a shot. It is enjoyable and definitely worth seeing. you may be surprised how well the story moves along with multiple battle sequences. I also appreciated seeing another country's attempt at an action/military movie."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Dante Lam delivers a first class action film with the support of Chinese military Though not a bad film - it was concerning for the overt Nationalism. Perhaps not as gripping as American made films dealing with similar concepts - it does nonetheless tick the boxes needed for an action movie. The last scene was quite overt in talking about Chinese waters.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"The film is adapted from the real events of Yemeni emigration. From the beginning of the evacuation of overseas Chinese, hijacking accidents, the Jiaolong team accepted the task and completed the task, all the way to the end. There was no particularly sensational dialogue and drama, and all kinds of weapons and artillery were fired directly. Some scenes are really bloody, which really makes people feel the cruelty of war and the precious of peace. Praise for China's special forces."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Just propaganda and jingoism made into a boring action film. The action itself is not that bad but the whole film just repeats a number of set pieces. They tried to make some characters relatable but that didn't work much either.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Dont waste your time! Not worth it! i dint want to talk more, but one sentence is to short for the imdb. actualy in this case is even to much."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I think this is a really a good movie about the the bravery and valour of soldiers in China, many of them who make great sacrifices to keep the international community safe from violent extremism; the Navy and Air Force of China working very well together with the International Community to protect human rights and civil liberties in the world!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"From the impressive opening scene to the climatic final battle, the action and suspense grips you and never lets go. The film is so fast-paced and the action so quick and relentless, the 138 minutes runtime feels quite short, actually. I've never quite experienced a film like this where the action is as intense and non-stop. (Maybe 'Wolf Warrior 2', but it was intense and not as suspenseful).The visual effects are simply awesome and the slow-motion photography effective and extremely well done. I also really enjoyed the film's score. The entire production was incredible and proves again how far Asian Cinema has come. The film was so much better (and more realistic) than Hollywood blockbusters. This was serious nail-biting stuff!!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"So if You want an non stop action with little story this movie is for You. Premise is simple special ops from China doing evacuation of their embassy in war torn country. Of course it's just the beginning of troubles for chinese commando unit. And movie is packed with shootouts, car chaces, tank battles, sniper duels and so on. Practicaly all the quite scenes between fighting are trimmed to bare minimum. And the action looks good, a lot of money went into special effects. There is a bit of propaganda in the movie fortunately on the level of American war movies. Be warned operation Red Sea is not for children some scenes are gory and too realistic. But if You are above 18 and want some good action movie give it a try."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"It's 2015 in the Gulf of Aden. Pirates have captured a Chinese merchant ship and the Chinese navy goes into action. A Chinese sniper is crippled while trying to arrest an escaping pirate. Reporter Xia Nan pursuing a terrorist and yellowcake uranium story is almost killed in a car bombing. After a coup in Yewaire, a naval task group and special forces are sent to evacuate civilians.There are a few concepts combined in this Chinese movie. The best one is the Black Hawk Down military movie. They obviously invested a lot military hardware. It's a patriotic affair and proud of it. Morocco makes for a solid devastated city backdrop. There is plenty of big explosions. Other than a few Matrix bullet time fantasy scenes, it works quite well as a semi-real action packed thrill ride. The characters have no particular charisma or individuality. It's just action and military hardware. It's not high-minded, and I have no problem with that. The reporter's story is probably trying to inject some political nuance which is unnecessary. She's a good character but it would make more sense if she's a Chinese super spy Jane Bond. She could lead the soldiers with intel to rescue the civilians and take down a terrorist group. Overall, this is a functional action movie. The lack of a lead protagonist does hold it back some. More time early on spent on the Captain would help."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"It's basically a series of unrealistic action sequences made worse with constant use of slow motion of people running or of a bullet moving. There was close to no storyline, and what storyline it did have was cliche and boring. Character development/interest was also at an all time low, so if you go to watch this, just expect a bunch of shooting and grenades being thrown. Pretty average guys."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Very beautiful film, very good action scene and the cast is fantastic"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"OPERATION RED SEA is the follow-up to the slightly disappointing OPERATION MEKONG and another feather in the cap of director Dante Lam. Just like WOLF WARRIOR II improved over the original, this film is far superior and one of the most enjoyable movies I've watched from the Chinese mainland. It's a simple story of soldiers vs. terrorists, shot in Morocco, with a big budget and lengthy running time. All but the most basic characterisation is bypassed and the plot whittled down to join-the-dots scripting between one massive battle scene and another. Imagine a Chinese BLACK HAWK DOWN, with the occasional nod to the likes of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, and you'll get the idea. It's intense and bloody, very well shot throughout, and even the CGI explosions aren't too shabby. I had a ball with it."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Movie is nice , story line , action , latest army equipment's all are superb but the actors who are in military they really don't seem to act like a military men .. over exaggerateing, suddenly shouting in normal situation , being very emotional at every other scene .. have u guys seen any real army men ,They are polite , elegant, strong silent and admired not like in this movie ... ah shouting ah shouting ah screeming ah crying..."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I usually enjoy good war films such as Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Dawn but this big budget rubbish is pure cringe and made me regurgitate my breakfast. Admittedly, many war movies are basically just recruitment and promotional mediums for the military but ""operation red sea"" is too blatant in how it conveys this message.The hypocrisy of the film is simply disgraceful and lacks shame. It tries to portray the chinese navy as a bunch of heroic goody two shoes but in reality are actually bullying, cowardly scum hiding behind their big armaments and weapons (The chinese navy is currently squatting on Philippine seas and have built illegal structures).Before the end credits rolled, a slogan of the imperialist a-holes is shown on the black screen ""Conquer Fear, Conquer All"". Now you can't get more blatant than that. Honestly, I really wish these governments and their respective armies should all be exiled into a distant rock in space where they could kill each other off. But it's alright, I myself am itching to shoot a few chinese military scumbags."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie is thrilling, and not boring at all, this war film seens like an analogy of 2017 War film ""Wolf Warrior 2"", pretty cool, and plenty of thrills contained in it, innit? I think it's dangerous and I was pretty scandalized when I heard the bombing and smokes and lots of special effects are actually REAL! Amazing!I soon knew this movie is based on a true incident, no wonder this movie seen pretty popular, it's great my brother actually chose this better war movie.The actor acted pretty cool and realistic, I ranted 9/10."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"What is a soldier's life? It is simple and straightforward. Train and train hard, go on a mission, complete it and come out alive. They might have a secret of their own, they may like someone, they may fear something, but who doesn't - therefore, who cares that much?The best of this film, is that it gives these emotional stuff a display, but never put too much effort to emphasize them. A subplot, a side-story, a childhood trauma reference, would have ruined it. The character building is through their actions, reactions, and made bright with that one touch of emotional moment, one second here, another there - and as an audience, I felt it fully.As for the action sequence, the intensity of the combat, the brutal of war, the films shows enough and exactly enough. What I felt most is throughout the mission, the bond between the team members, the trust, the loyalty and the brotherhood, is how it makes these soldiers an unity and invincible.Best military movie (or action movie) ever."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Despite having to read subtitles this is a quality military thriller.I was totally impressed with the quality of the camera work.I didn't realize the Chinese were capable of putting out a great military thriller.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"If you like this sort of movie, you will love this one: non-stop action, graphic bloodletting and many 'tough guy' moments as well as lots of armaments on display, ranging from a huge variety of small arms to tanks, drones, missiles, anti-missile 'Gatling guns', and helicopter gunships: all very cool and very loud. The grind-along soundtrack pumps up the action and the cinematography/CGI/stunts are all excellent. The plot follows a Chinese Navy special-ops team as they attempt a number of rescues in a fictional middle-eastern country (inspired by the 2005 rescue of Chinese nationals in Yeman). Mixed up in this is plucky reporter trying to find a MacGuffin containing information about 'yellowcake' that the terrorist plan to use in a dirty bomb. All of this is simply an excuse for loud and bloody mayhem. Like ""Black Hawk Down"", the film focuses on the comradery of the 'men (and women) on the ground', and if it doesn't scare you off, may make you want to sign up for a stint. The final scene, almost a cinematic ultimatum, is pure jingoism."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Basically everything i said and felt about operation mekong (same director) applies to this movie. the action was awesome, intense and large. so many great action scenes and moments. enough action in the first half to fill a whole movie. the music was awesome. some really great shots.the reason i didn't give it a higher score is because i didn't really care about the characters or the details of the story. when the action wasn't happening i didn't care much. that's partly because of the language barrier, but also partly because there are a LOT of characters. so you don't become attached to any of them. there are still some scenes with good emotions, but half the time i didn't know who was who. also as much of an action junkie as i am, near the end it started becoming too much. i got action fatigue. it was a little too long and didn't was a bit anti-climactic with a long end scene after the climaxlots of realism in the action with some great gore scenes. lots of moments that subvert expectations. this was a well made movie... for the most part. i probably wouldn't watch it again (1 viewing)"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"The design of action scenes is still very intentional, but the first half of the force is too strong, the result is that by the middle of the bullet-proof superman, the late sacrifice gives a helpless return to the impression of reason. Publicize the main theme, but also close to reality, we are not mentally retarded."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Most of Chinese movies are based on martial arts and a very few from war stories like Wolf Warrior 1 & 2 ( starrer Jing Wu) were remarkable Operation Red Sea is a best Chinese movie on war subject and based on a true event. A Chinese navy army firstly saves people on a ship from pirates. Their next mission is against terrorist to save a lady leader and find a chip for formula. The story is interesting and whole 2 hours and 15 minutes having full of war actions. Not a single moment spares you to relief. However, It seems movie is a little bit longer but action sequences like guns, missiles, tanks, snipers etc will makes you ignore to time. Climax is good. My only irritation about that the characters mess. Many Chinese soldiers look similar and names are so confused to memorise, otherwise movie is must watchable for action lovers. Acting is also perfect for ward drama. Courage and sound willingness to achieve target in any condition is the main spirit of the movie. Watch yourself and must watch, never miss."

Special Operations Forces do things as their Strategies and Tactics. just in case.Military Operations In Urban Terrain (M.O.U.T.) is always that brutal, 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, 2001 attacking Taliban held Cities of Bagram, Kabul, Kandahar (we were the U.S. Army Special Forces ODAs attacking South while ODAs 555, 595, 534?) attacked North as depicted by 2018 Movie ""12 Strong"").If we were still there (Yemen) we would have gladly helped the Chinese, however, after Democrat President Obama ""Outed"" Us, Al Quada Yemen aka Islamic State Yemen offered a kilo of gold (each) to any Yemenis that could prove they killed Us, so U.S. Army General Petraeus emergency exfiltrated Us back to Afghanistan.Some say that there is no ""Storyline"", Plot.

The director, writer (was there one?), the acting all horrendous. The storyline ... um ... wasn't there. It felt like a group of sixth graders were given a lot of money to blow up their action figures."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"China is gradually gaining ground in the military action genre with Operation Red Sea the latest addition to its stable of war films with Nationalistic overtones.Clearly a lot of money has been spent on this film not to mention, I suspect, the co-operation of the Chinese military. This war film has real scale, its epic in terms of the equipment utilised from ships to aircraft to military hardware. The battle scenes are equally big spread over a range of locations with varying scales and they are both incredibly frenetic and very, very visceral. Bodies of those impacted by weapons experience varying and evolving degrees of very bloody and often gory destruction. Its really not pretty at times but then war is an ugly business. Indeed I'd suggest, as a promotional film, to get China's young enthusiastic about joining up, this film may be sending a mixed message. It suspect it may be intended to inform the public of China's determination to see off anyone challenging the nations interests, as much as it might be considered a tool for military recruitment. As far as entertainment is concerned this film is impressive in many respects if you like military action flicks.The choreographing of the combat scenes shows real polish, co-coordinating often extensive and complex combat scenarios.Better still there's real variety in the breath and depth of conflict from mortar exchanges through to one on one sniper exchanges and more besides. CGI is used to good effect too, with slow motion ""bullet and missile time"". On the downside a good number of the conflict scenes sometimes tend to devolve into spectacles more reminiscent of video games than real warfare. Weapons exchanges that would have ended a conflict quickly become unrealistically drawn out affairs. Alternately, large numbers of well armed opponents fall like wheat when faced with markedly smaller Chinese forces. Its understandable in a sense, establishing the veneer of the the heroic Chinese underdog but its does stretch credulity at times. In summary a decent action packed war film. Yes there's Nationalistic stick but its the same kind you find in US and UK made war films and its no overdone just a little corny and amusing at times. Operation Red Sea does have subs too but this film is so heavily driven by pretty spectacular action its not really that big a deal. 8/10 from me."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie has everything, UAVs, drone strike, thermal imaging devices, fire weapons fitted with go-pros, fitted with flashlight, etc etc. The whole first hour of the movie is just a huge recruitment campaign for the Chinese navy.By the second hour of the movie, this whole technological gimmick is thrown away and the whole movie dissolves into a gore movie where emphasis is put into bloody scenes, dismembered bodies and close hand to hand combat.The movie actually does a great job of portraying actual military strategies and techniques like spotting snipers or use of smoke grenades / flash bangs.Where the movie fails is using the actual Yemeni conflict as a promotional campaign to push it's own military recruitment campaign. Even though the movie states it's based on true events, actual press releases shows Chinese contribution to the Yemeni conflict was basically nil."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"It is only worth to say, that the whole list of the movie ""supporters"" form the government was bigger than the screen.If you would like movies with Chuck, or other classic SpecOps movies (made by veterans), where ""our guys"" are never miss and never be killed (or within acceptable losses), ""Strike back"" series - that is movie for you.The biggest actor of the flick - cartoon figure of the ""Somali pirate"", with constant smile of the Jocker, who shows bigger play, than the rest of the actors.I fell asleep after about 1 hour (of the 2:13 !)."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie is everything but boring. I couldn't sleep after watching it and keep thinking how lucky I am to live in a peaceful place. It 's a movie that make you want to stay millions of miles away from war, any war. American social media, as they always do, think China simply wants to show off its military power and poses a threat to the U.S.'s control of South Sea in this movie(where on earth they got this?I must have missed it in the movie!) , it is really not about China being this or that, as the 8 Chinese soldiers are not even allowed to carry any Chinese weapons to enter the war zone and all used weapons are provided by local government, it is about we should be thankful that we don't live in war zone. And we shall all be damned if a war ever came, especially the commoners like you and me."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,A good movie. Love the action. They can do away with the bullet cam. Not a fan of slow mo bullet cam. Sniper scenes were tense.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I don't usually write reviews but this is complete rubbish. 8 vs. 150 - unlimited bullets? Bad guys one shot dead, Chinese dude shot 10 times can still combat. Unbelievable story plot. There goes two hours that I will never get back."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"To watch this movie and judge the amount of action contained in 2 hours and 22 minutes the only thing a person can do is say...wow. The movie plays out like a beaker full of adrenaline pumped into your system the entire running time with a few minutes that slow down only to have more pumped in as you begin to calm down. The Chinese Navy in the Red Sea first rescues the crew of a tanker taken over by Somali pirates by sending in their elite Special Forces team, the Jiaolong Assault Team. With the crew saved the team returns to their ship only to have enough time to get ready for their next mission.When civil war breaks out in Yewaire in the Arabian Peninsula, orders come down to evacuate all Chinese citizens from the area. The Navy is sent in to remove everyone and begins their evacuation at the docks. But there are more citizens and diplomats still within the city. Call in the Jiaolong Assault Team to save the day. But this time around things go from bad to worse and as the story plays out it seems that bad luck follows the group. As they pick up the diplomats it seems that every turn they take leads them to another rebel group armed to the teeth. Cars are blown up, comrades and Chinese citizens killed and new routes are calculated. As if that wasn't enough a Chinese journalist has discovered that the terrorist behind this insurgency have access to a large amount of yellowcake materials that they plan to use to make dirty bombs. She can't convince the leader of the team to pursue the terrorist since he only obeys orders. Of course she doesn't listen and due to her insistence people are injured and killed. But she remains determined to find a necklace containing the formula to make the dirty bombs and stop the terrorists. Unable to leave the way they planned the team forms a convoy of jeeps and begins making their way across the desert to a rendezvous 75 miles away. But along the way they're attacked by a sniper and rocket carrying terrorists. Suffering heavy losses they're down to the remaining 4 members of the team as their leader makes the decision to go after the terrorists with the yellowcake and formula. But at what cost?Made in China the film is said to be China's first modern naval film. It had amazing box office success when released and it's easy to see why. As I said earlier this film has an overabundance of action that's seen on screen and can be exhausting to watch. But that's not what makes the film so intriguing. As an American I've grown up with war films and movies about war heroes that commit the greatest sacrifice of all, giving their lives for their mission. I've also seen films about British soldiers usually WWII films where the same thing takes place. But while so many fear China no one ever talks about their army or navy or Special Forces units. Every country wants to claim they have the best unit in the world and in the eyes of those countries they do. But no one ever talks about each other's units. This film provides a look at what the team from China would be like as seen through their eyes. That's fascinating to me.The production values on display here are wonderful. The cinematography is equal to anything shot in the states offering a clear, clean vision of the carnage of war. The make-up effects are astounding and fans of gore fueled films will leave their horror flicks behind to seek this one out. While unbelievable at times (one solider has his arm blown off and yet continues to fight for another 5-10 minutes with the other) it looks amazingly real. And if nothing else has been learned over the years by the Chinese they certainly know how to blow things up effectively. The film runs out numerous explosions from start to finish. The special-effects people are also to be congratulated using techniques found in films like THE MATRIX to show bullets ripping through buildings in slow aerated motion before hitting their targets. When watching a foreign film the biggest difficulty lies in that term ""lost in translation"". It's difficult to digest the acting ability of those performing while trying to read what they're saying at the same time. But this film presents actors who do so well that's never a problem. The anguish of the soldiers as their comrades fall one by one is believable. All involved do a great job.Perhaps the only negative thing to say about this film is the same thing that makes it worth watching, that non-stop barrage of action that takes place. Not only are the actors tossed about and running from the get go the camera movements also tend to be swinging about, rushing from side to side and handheld as people are on the move. It provides a sense of urgency to the story but as I said can be exhausting to watch. Still in the end the movie entertains and provides a look at a group much like those we champion here, the warriors of the Special Forces."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"The amount of production that went into this move is just amazing, and you can see it, its looks great! The first half of the movie you got realistic believable warzone battles. The second half of the movie goes downright full rambo, delta force-esque gunfights, it was exhilarating! This movie is a candy store for militaristic movie junkies!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Haven't see a movie like this too long. Wolf Worrier 2 from last year might be blood-pumping. But Operation Red Sea just brings a military action movie to a whole new level. Compare to Dante Lam's Operation Mekong, he seems to improve himself a lot on presenting details to audiences, which really could be exciting for military fans. The start is breathtaking and yes, you will feel the same all the way to the end. The fighting scenes are incredibly realistic and brutal, which greatly trigger my respects to those who are guarding our peaceful lives right now. War could be bloodshed and extremely cruel. It is beyond the wildest imaginations. I would suggest that all of trolls aka keyboard worriers who are always shouting ""We will nuke you"" watch this movie. Solute to PLA!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Operation: Red Sea, a step of improvement in Chinese warfare cinematography, even if it's only a baby step. After having watching many of Chinese war films alongside with my mother over the past 16 years, it's undeniable that this could be one of the better made war films in its history. My focus however, is only on the battle scenes as I have no interest in its narrative style.Let's begin with some good sides. There are a few improvements worth mentioning that is demonstrated in the film. Firstly, I think it's worth a round of applause that after who knows many years of making war films, they finally, finally show the audience some severed limbs during combat. Secondly, armament variety. In the majority of war films featuring modern Chinese military, Chinese soldiers will always carrying their signature weapons, their QBZ assault rifles and their QBU sniper rifles, if there is a sniper role. For this film, there is a much bigger variety, not only for different types of assault rifles, but classes as well. They finally brought in machine guns (light and heavy) and more usage of RPGs. And finally, actual usage of tanks. For most of their war films, the tanks shown in the film never see actual combat, at most used in simulation. We finally get to see some live action with tanks, even if it was horribly portrayed.Now, the usual and usual bad stuff scene in Chinese war films. I think one of their biggest flaws in the film is consistency. When at first I saw the car bomb scene, I was surprised to see the focus on the reality of the explosion. It was only a one-time thing however. Many of the explosions portrayed later in the film failed to stay consistent with how damaging the explosions or ""pyroworks"" can be. I don't exactly remember which character it was, but I counted that he died at least five times just from explosions, whether it was from mortar fire, from grenades, or from other explosions. It was frustrating to see him still kicking like nothing happened and ""beating the bad guys."" In fact, I believe that in the scene with the mortars, half of the Chinese squad that was there should be dead including that French-Chinese individual. The scale of the explosion portrayed from the munitions exploding is much similar to the initial car bomb scene. In the car bomb scene, barely anyone survived, and if they did suffered severe wounds. In the mortar scene however, they were simply covered in sand, and not mentioning the classic Chinese style of over-the-top dramatic fallen teammates shots. From that range, if they followed the consistency, the mere shock wave would've killed them all.And while we're in the sandy mortar scene, let's talk about that painful sniper shot. I counted, that shot of the fired bullet took a total of thirty seconds to travel from the mouth of the barrel to scratch the side of the fleeing sniper's face. A painful scene to watch. It's cool to see a shot like that, but overdoing it is another thing. Spending over ten seconds showing a shot like that is already too long, let alone the half-minute. The slow-motion was set into three parts: in front of the bullet, the side of the bullet, and finally the back. I can only explain that through the liking of Chinese cinematography to over dramatize.One more scene from this sandy mortar section needs to be mentioned. I couldn't possibly let the acrobatic explosion scene slide can I. I get it that he jumped to escape the mortar round and that the explosion would push him further away, but the front flip? Who thought of that and actually put that in the film? And of course, he should be dead (I think that's the character that I counted that should've died for at least five times). And also, the fact that he gets up like nothing really happened, again is extremely frustrating to watch as he continues to ""beat more bad guys."" Also, also, just to add one more ""should've died"" scene, the sniper who was under mortar fire. The explosion was way too close for him to survive that shock.Next off, the scene when the T-72 tank was first used to fire. Might as well mentioning why there is a label in the front of the T-72 tanks that reads ""W 13""? and why the tank is painted with a Chinese army camouflage? This is another ridiculous scene, more of a WTF scene actually. The tank fired a shell that penetrated I think three stone columns AND THEN exploded? I get the fact that AP or armor piercing round can easily penetrate those stone columns, but then how in seven hells does it create such a massive explosion by hitting a house? A HE or high explosive round can do that, but then it can't penetrate those columns. It's a very dramatic scene that takes the term unrealistic to another level, to the point that even my mother, who lacks such knowledge, felt weird watching that scene.Now, the tank chase scene. Does it ever occur to you that like in a video game, the enemies are scripted to have extremely poor accuracy? For some odd reason, the Arabic fighters are shown to be very capable, like their quick calculations in adjusting their aim for the mortars and their skilled sniper, but can't really hit that T-72 with four pursuing it. It's not just this scene, it's in every scene where when it comes to aiming at the Chinese soldiers, the Arabic fighters can't aim straight. It's like they have a cheat code for survival. Back to the tank scene, there are a few weird scenes shown here. A couple of frustrating ones are when one of the M60 tanks just stops as it no longer works after being hit with, presumably, a HEAT round on the reactive armor plating on the turret. The plating is gone but the turret is really undamaged, and yet it just stops. Another one where the the tank was hit in the turret, but its tracks are destroyed? consistency much?Fast forwarding to the sandstorm scene, the ""convenient sandstorm"" scene, I think this is one of the dumbest scene ever made. First of all, why would anyone disembark their intact, not exploding anytime soon, vehicle into a sandstorm? Do they not know how deadly a sandstorm is? Secondly, the portrayal of the sandstorm was extremely poor; we were able to see clearly what was going on inside that storm. From what the film initially portrayed, that storm should've reduced visibility to close to nothing but about a few feet in front of you. Disregarding the sandstorm, there was a scene with a M60 tank laying down MG fire on one of the Chinese soldiers as another destroyed the tracks. Tell me why and who is stupid enough to leave its combat vehicle just because the tracks are destroyed? Those Arabic fighters just left all their firepower just because they lost mobility, at which they were moving at snail's pace anyway. And the final face-off scene between the two tanks, the drone. . .I don't know how it managed to hit the ""hostile"" one, maybe there was dialogue I missed? And speaking of, the communications in this film is atrocious. Their screaming and yelling is nearly impossible to understand without subtitles. My mother couldn't hear half of the conversations. And with this poor communication, how did they pull off not killing their own since both tanks are M60 tanks? In a sandstorm ""like so portrayed,"" it's impossible to use visual confirmation, and I would assume thermal targeting. They didn't even show a scene like that in their too. . .on how they targeted and hit the tank (they love doing those dramatic scenes).Oh right, I almost forgot about the scene with the warship. Funnily enough, warship looks a lot like the US Arleigh Burke guided missile destroyer. Is it true that the Chinese have a rip-off version of the Arleigh Burke? Anyways, that scene where it defended itself with the Phalanx against the seven missiles is absolutely ridiculous. Based on what the scene is portraying, by the time the crew kicks in with the Phalanx, the missiles are already in a close danger range, and with how tightly packed they are, there is no way none of those missiles hit. It was impossible for them to completely wipe out all those missiles that are later portrayed to come is looser packs. All that UAV launching and support fire is pretty bull. That destroyer would be rendered combat ineffective, or worst sunk as it would be hit broadside.I think that's enough. . .just one more thing: the classic ""time shall stop when our teammate is hit and is about to die, maybe."" This never gets old does it? I'm not sure if it's unique to Chinese cinematography, but the way they do it, it's way too unrealistic and dramatic. My mother complains all the time: ""and they would just stop shooting?""Yeah, that's all. I don't know if I can say disappointed. I heard that this film is the most well-made in terms of fighting, which I can see. It's an improvement, but having watched many other foreign war films like from the US, the UK, Malaysia, Korea, Russia, Germany, etc., Chinese war films just can never achieve the ""audience on edge"" effect even though its seems like the film was supposed to have that effect. And the way Chinese war films try to portray patriotism and heroism, it just feels very over-dramatic and it's really poking fun at themselves rather than having us feel that patriotism, that heroism. In worse terms, they're disgracing what it means to be a soldier. Horrible, absolutely horrible, and even in this film that style doesn't change. I really would've gave it half a star, but another half for effort."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"""Operation Red Sea "" is a remarkable film. It describes the war scene by a realistic approach, that many people feel too bloody after watching the movie. However, the modern war is so brutal that it can not escape the fate of the heroic sacrifice even if the cruelty of the war is masked. It is an ordinary person, after all, not a Hollywood superman. It reflects the Chinese national defense concept and the main duties and responsibilities of the military in peacetime now. Some people have questioned that the story of saving a few hostage at the expense of special troops' life is unreasonable, because it's not worth to that! In fact, these fans should not understand the movie. Whether in the movie or in reality, the military will do so. This is not only to safeguard people's lives and property, but also to defend the responsibility and honor of an army."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"The special effects, slow motion, photography, graphics, makeup, ambience, perfect, the scenes of very good wars, the dramas leave a little to be desired, medium script, the film is interesting only for the visual and sound presentation, no and it involved... Regular..."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Effects are okay, gear junkies will be satisfied, that part was done good.It started okay, but as the movie goes, it's slowly becoming ridiculous. Everyone dies and gets hit, yet those Cinese forces just dodge bullets and bombs. If you wanna watch movie that portraits Cinese military as best in the World, how their soldiers can kill several enemies with single bullet, how they can kill target holding hostage which they can barely see from moving helicopter, how every shot is kill shot(okay, most of them,lol), how they will put they own life in danger just to save some no name civilian etc.All in all, better than I expected, but not nearly as good as other reviews make it."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Wow! this was bad not in a unwatchable way but it was bad from the script to the atrocious editing, the action scenes was all over the place and you can't tale what going on, the filmmakers used alot of practical effects and that's good, but they used alot of CGI and it's in your face in how bad it is. The first quarter of the movie was ok and realistic but after that these soldiers became a video game soldiers with a magazine can hold thousands of bullets, they never for once change the magazine or take ammo from the terrorists. Honestly the last 30 minutes I think the movie became a government propaganda and I started laughing. The terrorists are super terrorists who are unbelievably fearless, they are not a few terrorists they were an army. But the final slap in the face the filmmakers wants you to know that all the over the top and unrealistic sh*t you have seen is ""based on a true events"", yeah, off course!."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,There is no storyline. Just boom and shooting. I really wasted my time. I stopped after feeling bored.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Remember, people: this is a story about an elite military unit trying to foil a dirty bomb plot during a different rescue mission, nothing more, nothing less. Given this story line and its clear focus on action, allow yourselves to be entertained. Its the bang-boom-bang movie of the year, which is why it's on track to become China's most successful movie export ever. Expect more of this with the trade war, as the ending clearly suggests that it's also intended as a line in the sand - pardon, sea - between China and the US of A.My two cents on the most frequent criticism on this one: there's no story and pretty much constant action. As other people have pointed out: the reason why this movie is constant, uninterrupted mayhem is that warfare really is that crazy, as anyone can learn from a multitude of books, documentaries or (like yours truly) friends in the military. The situation in Yemen - for which the location is a thinly veiled stand-in - is so complex that one should feel grateful that there is no attempt whatsoever to put what happens into perspective, as so many Hollywood propaganda drivels do. I didn't like the predecessor to this one, ""Operation Mekong"", because of its truckload of stereotypes about Thais and Burmese. ""Operation Red Sea"" is a huge improvement because it doesn't pretend to be anything more or less than an action flick with a bit of ""China saves the day"" on the side."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Making good domestic war films with heart would be welcomed by the Chinese masses. This movie illustrates this truth.1. Weak point:a. When the terrorist sniper was killed, he was not as cunning as when the first time he injured his ear by sniper from Chinese Marine Corps.b. The terrorist leader had even committed suicide. In contrast, Saddam Hussein did not commit suicide, as he had hidden himself in the cave. And Bin Laden did not commit suicide, as he had used his wife to block the bullet!2. Strong point:a. The plot is compact. No extra lines, less emotional play and continuous shooting or gunfire, make the audience overwhelmed.b. Collectivism is the main tone. Chinese Marine Corps operations highlighted teamwork, as well as did not promote individual heroism. This movie breaks the myth of the protagonist in the past movie as Superman who is undead. After all, one soldier and one correspondent were killed in this movie.c. The sense of authenticity is very strong. Because the details of this movie were done very carefully, it makes the audience feel the reality and faces the cruelty of the war. For example, the bloodied bodies and the wailing of survivors of the buses that were hit by mortar shells. After fighting with terrorists, a Marines found himself missed his fingers. Another Marine was thrown back the grenade, then he found one of his arms blown off. One is being knocked off the half face, still suffering from pain and fighting until death.d. This movie reinforces the role of the actresses. A female marine corps, Tong Li and a female journalist, Xia Nan, were as brave and smart as male comrades in marine corps. In this movie, the actresses didn't put their comrades in unnecessary danger, as in other films and TV shows. And they were not stupid enough to delay critical time. They play a vital role even in many vital moments. The role of female characters in this movie is no longer the influence and motivation of male protagonists in the past, but to change the dangerous situation through their own roles.In general, the movie tells people through the bloody war scenes: the war brings us only death and disaster, and at the same time, we know that today's happy life is hard and avoid war as much as possible."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Total waste of time. It is a mash-up of different war film genres with the hopes of looking cool but fails miserably. It was a pain to even speed through the 2+ hours of indulgent propaganda. Waste of bandwidth :(-1/10
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"There are a lot of asian movies (besides Bruce Lee's and Jackie Chan's) that are awesome (Serbuan Maut a.k.a. The Raid 1 & 2 starring Iko Uwais, Ong Bak, Tom Yum Goong a.k.a. The Protector starring Tony Jaa), in this case, a chinese film about its navy military and it has non stop action. Based on a real life event with great acting and awesome action sequences. The score is also great.I truly recommend it."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"First off, I watched this in China, the domestic version may differ slightly from the international version. Another thing is that I typed over 3300 words on Word (I was expecting 4000+ if I'd finished fleshing it out) before remembering to check if there's a character limit, turns out there's only 10000 characters allowed on IMDB, so I decided to leave out all the details (therefore the spoilers) and I'll see if I eventually get to post the full version elsewhereThe film, if we could call it one, is terrible. The plot, was very shallow. The fact that the editing often comes across half a beat off and that some corny acting went uncorrected further distracts you from the plot. About half of the shooting scenes, which would be about an hour of the film length, don't serve any purpose. Whatever messages the director was trying to send, however powerful the Chinese military is, however much it cares about Chinese nationals, how it protects even local civilians, how China respects human rights...he could've sent them within half the action sequences, the rest are highly redundant, and all the while we still see an astonishing lack of character depth.In fact, the film is long enough, or its priorities messed up enough, that it sent conflicting messages. I could see the director torn between satisfying the audience's taste for gore (or his own...?) under censorship that by principle doesn't allow anywhere near as much gore, (only exception being ""official gore"", with connections to the Party), the Chinese Navy's (major sponsor) demand for a flaunt of force, with emphasis on yet how *lawful* (stab at the US) the Chinese military is, the Party's need for promoting its same old nationalism, displaying China's culturally traditional collectivism, and still coming around to develop China's own personal heroism, and last of all the most basic requirement of piecing all that together into a workable plot.All the characters, from both sides, were also very shallow. The precious few attempts at character building amount to a really short prelude, above that awfully wanting from a constructive standpoint; a line or two of dialogue not (directly) regarding cutting down the enemy or a fleeting shot or two of not (directly) combat-related details every 15-20min, and those mostly fail to serve their purpose due to lack of a proper build-up beforehand, lack of convincing acting, or because of improper timing, in turn due to the subpar editing here and there and the plainly bad script. And there were...about 2 attempts in all of the films 2 hours or so to try to build a significant and rememberable antagonist. Don't watch this if you're looking for the human element in an action film, you may be better off watching a bunch of Terminators. At least they're just rigid, not embarrassing and even mildly amusing when they're actually trying to move you.The film is supposedly based on an evacuation of Chinese nationals from Yemen by the military. In reality, they didn't fire a single shot, yet this film is all about depicting in detail the Jiaolong squad of eight cutting down hundreds and hundreds of rebels/terrorists, and they still had the audacity to state during PR sessions and at the end of the film that this is ""based on real events"". That's about as real as shooting Resident Evil based on a regular flu season. Hell, it's hardly even realistic. It got so much praise back in China about the supposed ""realism"", but it's actually the *surrealism* to this film that most strongly bothers me. People don't die when they're supposed to (protagonists survive 155mm howitizer shells, and more), and die when they're not (the Stinger's limited homing capabilities means it doesn't turn around for a second pass when it misses). It resembles a spatter film more than a realistic war film like Dunkirk. Dunkirk's main problem is the size of the bullet holes, but this has magnitudes more problems in ballistics, in human biology, in basic battle tactics and rules of engagement, etc.About the three deduced stars for propaganda, this freak show of assorted deaths got 8.5 on Douban and 9.5 on Maoyan, and while Maoyan's crawling with paid trolls(the way that system's built, you may not even need actual trolls to alter the rating), far beyond salvation, and most Chinese know that, this is new for Douban. Douban's been mostly neutral, mostly filled with decently educated people up until recently, so it's one of the very few forums under surveillance of the Chinese government whose collective opinion actually hold weight. Now, what does an 8.5 on Douban mean? Leon the Professional: 8.4Django Unchained: 8.5The Dark Knight Rises: 8.6I think by now most of us around the world have an idea what height that 8.5 stands for, a height this plotless logic-less surreal gore fest is surely unworthy of. So where does the propaganda come in? When the jingoististic Wolf Warriors 2, with the push of the Nanjing Area Command, netted a meager 7.0 on Douban last year (now slightly higher) despite a complete lack of challenge at the box office, China's Communist Youth League voiced specific discontent on its official Microblog. It's not difficult to make the connection that EVERYBODY, literally EVERY media outlet in China pulling out all the stops kissing Lam's ass and showering praise all over the film, sponsored by the Chinese Navy, is their doing. What's supposed to be a B-grade, R-rated film (China doesn't rate films, so many children watched this), filled to brim with gore but sorely lacking in logic, plot, and character building, isn't for everyone, nor even for a majority. Yet bribe a few opinion leaders and a bunch of trolls (there's an abnormal surge of new users with zero activity giving 5 stars, which means 10.0 there) to the point where there's enough zombies brainwashed and hostile that they'll come register and vote and spam on their own at the first sight of criticism, and not enough independently thinking people fighting back, then there you go, 8.5 on Douban. Because brainwash is contagious, the three stars deduced is part of my feeble personal attempt of vaccinating unwitting IMDB users from that brainwash. And yes, I already gave one star on Douban, there's no zero star option."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys realistic, gritty war movies, as long as...1) you are able to overlook a few mistakes in the realism...and...2) you don't mind that the movie has a pro-military message. If you see either of those two things as a bad thing, then feel free to check out my descriptions of them here below, to figure out if this movie is your cup of tea or not.By the way, I am not Chinese, and not American, so hopefully I can avoid the bias that I saw in many of the other reviews.1) The mistakes in realism:There were only two mistakes that were big enough to mention. The first was when a vehicle is shot in the gasoline tank and explodes. The second was when someone was shot by small arms fire and flew back like three meters. If you can overlook mistakes like that, then you can still enjoy this movie.2) The pro-military message:Many of the other reviews are complaining that this movie is funded by the Chinese military and that it shows the Chinese military in a favorable light. However, as any serious fan of war movies knows, the US military funds more than 90% of the movies about the US military, and as a reward for that funding, the movie makers tend to show the US military in a favorable light. Like I said, any serious fan of war movies knows this. And most war movie fans don't mind it, as long as the favorable light isn't too strong, and as long as it's tastefully done. And in my opinion, this movie did a pretty good job there.I hope this review was useful to you, and that you were able to figure out if this movie is your cup of tea or not."

Just like watching Black Hawk Down, if you like that one, most likely You will like this one too. Chinese film, specially military war films are catching up with Hollywood. And in many way, learning the both good and bad from it.+All the military Gears looks great. +Most of the combat scene, and there is ALOT of it, and damn, they look great! I would said 85% looks real and most part believable. Many the tactics and small details are very well done and not many mistakes in action parts. And you know where all the budget had gone to. Not to the script that is for sure! +Political overtone and nationalistic tone is WAY WAY less then one would expect from a Chinese military movie(and specially consider this film is made with the help of Chinese military). I would go on to say, that person that says this movie is propaganda movie or too nationalistic, are just watching this for the wrong reason, they are watching this TO HATE it! As if this is classified as Propaganda films, I would say last 20 years of Hollywood war movie should also be classified as one too. +I like those part of hints that Chinese officer corp members are too stiff to change.+It's also very nice for the film to actually bring out the Chinese military's interpersonal culture, which just like Asian interpersonal culture in general, that is very different then The west and specially to the US.There some bad, even if one watch this as war movie.-Basically the plot is just there to have a reason to SHOOT Guns, big and small ones. Sure, it is ""base"" on real event. But it should said:It was ""base VERY VERY loosely on real event""!-The ""Only"" good guys are the Chinese guys, ""The Savior"" complex and Chinese style political correctness is just funny to watch. Ofc Hollywood movies also do have those in many it's films. Not that one actually expecting these things are not in the film, but minus from a film geeks point of view anyway!-There is some Chinese style political message and propaganda message in it, not that much, but still it's there and it's ofc minus!"

Lin Chaoxian has great ambition. He filled this work with too many clues and expected war scenes, so he completely abandoned the literary drama and really did it from beginning to end. The carnival of war film lovers, the ordinary audience will be very tired. It should become a new benchmark for the completion of mainland war films."

红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I finished the movie yesterday, still fell unreal. It's like a civilian first time experiencing real war, not the kind of wars that were shown in the Hollywood war movies, but an extremely realistic one, the one that you will experience when you walk right into the middle of an ongoing armed conflict . I have watched countless war movies from all over the world but I have never felt the way like I had on yesterday. I heard from my Chinese friends about modern Chinese young netizens love to see China gets into a war with other countries to demonstrate the ability of their Military force. I strongly advice them to see this movie, to see what will really happen in a war."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Coming from a country where a lot of pro military flicks are made one way or another, I can't really say anything. But as far as Operation: Red Sea goes, it's a pretty solid military/action story. It's combat scenes are pretty well done, the characters have pretty good chemistry, and even the story wasn't terrible. It kind of makes me think of American action/war films like Lone Survivor and Act of Valor, but from a modern Chinese perspective.It's worth watching once, just for a unique perspective, but it's not something I'll watch twice, personally."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,The plot is fast-paced and enjoyable to watch. The movie's war scene is cruel and bloody. Peace is really not easy. Thank you for being born in a peaceful country
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"If you have something against the Chinese this movie is not for you. It is an essentially military propaganda film, like GI Joe, only much better and not as ridiculous. It is about an elite unit trying to rescue Chinese citizens from the civil war in a middle eastern country. It is a bit confusing at first, but if you pay attention in the beginning, you will have a good handle on what is going on.Once the action starts it is almost non stop, the elite unit gets tasked with one mission after another and the situations for them keep changing. They keep losing personnel and most of the time they are outnumbered. But they persevere and keep completing their missions. Yes, unbelievable, but satisfying.One thing about this movie is it's depiction of what actually happens in war. The effects of explosions and bullet wounds are realistic and quite graphic, unlike the mostly bloodless explosions in Hollywood movies.Yes, it's over the top,and a bit long, but it is one of the most enjoyable action movies I've seen and a while. If you enjoy action/war movies then this is a good pick."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Can only agree with the previous speakers! Just fantastic! John Woo could not have done better! 10/10 BOOM again!
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Not really a film but more an action packed promo for the Chinese Navy! Based on a true story though, in real life, I don't believe the Chinese did any actual fighting, let alone fight against impossible odds. Perhaps it's better to say this film is loosely based on Black Hawk Down. I found it a bit amusing how they kept reiterating how uncomfortable they were going into other nations territorial waters while in real life the Chinese seem quite happy to rename these waters as their own. These days they're even building their own islands in international waters and then calling the surrounding seas their own too!As a make believe action film I think it works, it's action packed and doesn't pull any punches. As a portrayal of a true story it's almost 99% fiction. As a statement of intent for the Chinese Navy I found it a little worrying. It will be ""interesting"" to see how the Chinese Navy live up to the film, I suspect they're going to get some real life practise in the coming years."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Nonstop action sequences all the way - a bit gory at times but believable.I enjoyed this and the acting was good .

红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Booooom!!! This is really an unbelievable movie for its boring and nasty story line. U gonna see a lot of guns but nothing else.A movie without a story is just common youtube video, or even worse. In Hacksaw Ridge, it tells a legend about Desmond Doss who served US marines as a medic refusing to use a gun and saved 75 men on him own in battle. In Operation Red Sea, I remember endless gun shots and awful acting. Another Chinese movie called Assembly is much better. My Chinese friends told me that this nasty movie earned a lot in China, Now I think I know why there is few Chinese good movie."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Like many oriental films a tad bit long. The story line was a little hard to follow, I tried to find info on the real events doesn't seem things happened quite the way the movie shows it but, China did rescue folks from Yemen.Graphically not bad, I would say worth watching but probably best on a rainy afternoon at home."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"It's 2015 in the Gulf of Aden. Pirates have captured a Chinese merchant ship and the Chinese navy goes into action.

After a coup in Yewaire, a naval task group and special forces are sent to evacuate civilians."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie is better than black hawk down, jarhead. I love The RAID series and this movie has even more action than that. Whoever doesn't think this movie is a 9 or 10 is crazy. Brutal and realistic more than any war movie.. 2 hours of intense action"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,I thought this was complete bull until I saw the USA am GM sold the Hummer to China.

红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,This is cool action movie with good meaning. The actors and actresses are excellent performances!! I felt like I was in the movie!!
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This movie was so worth it! A post-9/11/GWOT era patriotic American-style action film, except about the PLA Chinese military. I mean it flows beat-for-beat exactly as American SPEC-OPs counterterror movies but the heroes are the PLA. 100% propaganda piece, but in the most obtuse and unabashedly beautiful manner. More than 2 hours of war-film cliche after cliche where you think, ""there's no way they'd do that, that's too cliche,"" and then they do exactly what you expect and in the most over the top glorious manner. To make this even better, the setup to the action scenes feels EXACTLY like a Call of Duty cutscene, down to even how the actors are placed within the scene (just watch it). Oh, and it's also a better GI Joe movie than the GI Joe movies as the PLA soldiers keep escalating their ""cool guy"" equipment and antics! How does one movie manage to be this cliche?? Oh, but the action is good, bordering on real good. This movie does one thing, and does it well.A fascinating look at Chinese cultural idealism, even more fun when by the questions it raises. For example, why are the PLA using so many Western weapons and Humvees? Because in the real world China bought the licenses or stole the plans, but the net effect only heightens the GWOT/Americana jingoist-feel to surreal levels. Like most GWOT-era films the terrorists are seen as ""animals"" devoid of any personality or cause, literally nothing more than the reason for the PLA to be heroic (and a fascinating look at Chinese government perception of the Middle East and Africa, and their presence in these regions).It is so unoriginal that it's original. Worth the rent!"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"Warning SPOILERS!!!Really great experience watching! Lots of intense scenes, machinery combat really captured in a way that audiences can get: sniper vs sniper, tank vs tank etc. Very interesting participation by the reporter Xia Nan in the rescue task, she played important role especially that she speaks the language and gets the map of the camp from local female villagers. She also added to the extended aim/task to the Jiao Long team.Lots of viewers find the ""story line not existing"". You really have to FOCUS, particularly in the first 1/3 because all the small hints and critical info of the main story line are scattered in fast scenes of phone calls. I have to say Damte Lam did a great job the lay out the complicated storyline and gradually escalated mission in a very efficient and triggering way. However the downside with this layout of story line is that really need to focus and concentrate - understand almost all the lines happening to the characters in chaotic situations. I watched together with my husband at home, he did not get it at all 30 mins into the movie what it is about... When I explained ""the mission was initially to evacuate Chinese citizens which was not in any conflict with the rebels org Zaka, but when the families of a high government official joins the Chinese consulate it became a target for Zaka."" He was so shocked and literally laughed ""are we watching the same movie?!"" Yes because he was not focusing in the beginning, going to toilet without pausing the film and texting friend etc....Cons: A bit unrealistic that the last four members use flying suits to land.... that really demands lots lots of professional training, and not possible to take with them guns and other equipments....In addiction, the film can trim down the bullets slow motion as the film is already long without."

The main actor for Wolf Warrior is also the director. He was broke and had to make many loans to actually make the movie. So people can stop saying ""CHINESE MILITARY MOVIES ARE PROPAGANDA!"" Because they're not. I know, because I'm Chinese.Next, If you ever watch this movie, I recommend turning the sound down. Also, talking to the people who say that Operation Red Sea is fake are also uneducated. Operation Red Sea was a real event, and actually events in the movie actually happened. And lastly, as a spoiler, The Eight Warriors Win!!!"

Actually, the movie is one long action sequence and who knows who the characters are, their relationships, etc. Because there is no character development.There is one black guy, in an Arab headdress, in a tiny motorboat firing a file at an advanced helicopter. Where's the drama in that?Anyway, get some popcorn and watch for some mindless nothingness."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,This is by far the best war movie I have watched in last couple of years. It's very similar to Black hawk down.I have a feeling that if this was Hoolywood movie it would be blockbuster but people have prejudice towards Chinese movies.
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"The movie is based on the Yemeni evacuation incident. The film ""Red Sea Action"" does not consider the public because it does not like the bloody, put the war into the game in general, the director bold and realistic performance of the cruel war, war, there will be casualties on the battlefield want to live life, physical fitness To be hard enough, some people have to keep up with you, or pull the hind legs can only die together, many people feel bloody after watching the movie. The film is still very prominent team awareness in the dragon commandos, their clear division of labor, who will not appear the most important position, the role of everyone in the team are irreplaceable. We follow the captain's order, in the face of difficulties and adaptability, so that they lead to success. Peace is wonderful"

Im kinda confused at first due to who and what is the plot all about. but in the middle and at the last part you'll appreciate it specially when only 4 of them left (chinese navy soldiers).overall its good and kinda OK(sorry for my english and grammar)"
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I love the film so much that I have watched it 5 times. The film is extremely shocking. The war scenes are cruel and realistic, with many tactical details which are worth examining. There is no gender preference, no weakening of the enemy, no forced sacrifice, no deliberate incitement and no one against 100. There is some team fighting though, showing the mutual support of comrades.War is cruel. We are very fortunate to live in a peaceful country with a stable society."
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"This film is very disjointed though fairly fun too watch , I'd saw it at 2 in the morning and though most scenes made zero sense to me the film was fairly too watch made most in part due to the massive amounts of blood , gore and torture."

These Americans always choose to be blind when they are betrayed or abandoned by their government. So sad and pathetic...

红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,Good movie that would offer some action scenes not the best acting in some parts be tolerable
红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"You like war films? Black Hawk down? Saving private Ryan? This movie is for you.You like tactical gear porn and modem warfare with latest shooting tactics? This is the movie you should not miss.For years, war film that are grounded in reality is hard to make. Even for Hollywood, only a very few there that can do realistic war depiction. Quality War movie that are based in Modern warfare are even more rare to find.If you are a tactical shooting guy who is looking for a legit tactical movie with LIVELEAK style combat scene, watch this film when it came out on blue-ray or netflix.Action sequences are breath taking! the mortar scene is one of the most realistic one in war movies. The flying flesh, the shock wave,the PTSD, the aftermath. I have watch a lot of war movies but darn some scenes in this film are freaking hardcore, like hard-core Rated R. I was having Minor ""ptsd"" after watching the film for few hours not kidding. And this is only one of the many scenes.Operation Red Sea is one of those movies that when you watch it, you appreciate all the dedicated realistic details in the movie. If you know anything about tactical shooting or military, you will be satisfied by the tactical loadout of different operators,The tactical movement of the squad, the amazing muzzle awareness, the trigger finger discipline, the dynamic shooting stance and combat improvisation in extreme condition,you can tell this film crew went through a lot of military training to get to this professional level.So many things to talk about and not to mention this movie is made by China which does not have a good record of quality war films. This is definitely a major step up."

红海行动,Operation Red Sea (2018),,2018,2018.02.23,"I have never seen such a silly picture. It is seen here that only 5 soldiers killed 15000 or more soldiers but nothing happened to them. Does it have any logic ?? Chinese pictures have become Bollywood or not! It took American troops 20 years to subdue the rebels, but they failed. And here one day they suppressed the rebellion with only 5 of my soldiers."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I did not originally want to watch this film as I do not like the story it is based on but I am glad I did.I am a huge fan of myths and legends of different countries and cultures and I liked the old Chinese animations.4 years ago, they made a Monkey King animation which I loved and finding out that that team helped on the Nezha movie was one of the reasons why I chose to watch it.The core concept is about fighting fate and against how others see you.Another point I loved about it is as it is a Chinese movie it is told from a Chinese perspective and from Chinese culture. This is great way for people to learn more Chinese people and culture. The down side is it is different to movies that we are used to and a lot will not be understood if we are not Chinese or know much about Chinese mythology. Also some of the jokes reference Stephen Chow's work.The English title ""I am the destiny"" makes sense to Chinese viewers, it is meant to be artistic with deep meanings (I spent a day discussing the title with my wife who is Chinese, she was explaining why she understood this title while it would not have been her first choice). Think of it as ""I make my own fate"" or if they just chose ""Nezha: Fate""The animation is amazing, the difference between the characters (humans, animals, clouds) and the scenery is marvellous. I wished to look at more of the buildings but that's just me being weird.The music is great. Very exciting and also a lot using traditional Chinese instruments (one part is a tribute to the Terminator movies with traditional Chinese instruments) also the credits music is a great song they made for the moive with a lot of great lyrics (in Chinese)The action scenes are beautifully made and flow very well. Also the pacing of the movie is perfect, at no point did I feel they dragged a joke or a scene on for too long.The story is a retelling so some people may be annoyed that it deviating from the original but Disney does it all the time so leave them alone.The story is interesting and the changes makes it more relatable.There are some bugs with the animation but they almost didn't finish in time for the summer holidays so I'm willing to overlook that.What's more is the director's backstory. He studied medicine in University. His animation background, all self taught. Made a 3d animation by himself and won a lot of awards. The company he works for now collected a lot of animation companies together to make this movie. They risked a lot but this movie is the director's dream which he had been thinking about for years.This can be seen in his attention to details. One of the charecters has a different accent because of where this character is from. And the director spent a lot of time to find the perfect voice actors for his characters (which I find to be a major failing of the Chinese animation industry in general, some beautiful animations ruined by frustratingly annoying voice actors)Background information you should know.The old guy is the most powerful in heaven.In China, a master takes disciples for training. He is like a parent, teacher and master at the same time. Choosing a master or a disciple is not entered into lightly.At that time, monster attacks are common and many people have lost family to them.Might need to find a Chinese friend to help explain other points you may find confusingI've seen it 7 times and I advice you to watch it on IMAX, looks better.I hope they get a good subtitles team, a lot of jokes will be hard to translate. I also hope that they don't dub it. The dubbed version of ""Hero is Back"" the Monkey King animation was terrible and ruined itAlso hope that they will release it in China with the English subtitles so that I have an excuse to watch it again"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The animation and action styles take some getting used to, as does the entire mythological aesthetic. That's not a complaint that more background should have been given for a non-Chinese audience. A quick search of wikipedia shows that this story is based on a Ming-dynasty novel with Taoist themes, and has multiple retellings/versions, including an animated 1979 version, Nezha Conquers the Dragon King. The current version was from an unknown studio, but was massively popular in China, where it has clearly tapped into the cultural Zeitgeist. For myself and my children, what impressed was the stylized but sharp animation, the epic scale, and the manic action scenes. The most distinctive part was the untraditional anti-hero, essentially a young bratty way who simultaneously fights against his own brattiness and others' dislike of him, as well as his fate to die in 3 years; ultimately, he and his frenemy/twin Ao Bing reconcile to overcome this fate, at least partially. The plot reminded me a bit of a Jungian transcendence of opposites in the personality - after all, both Ne Zha and Ao Bing come from the same chaos pearl!Sebastian: 10 StarsSienna: 8 StarsPaul: 8 StarsSienna's Favorite Character: Drunken Master!Sebastian's Favorite Character: The Dragon."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,It's such a spectacular movie I was totally blown away while watching it in theater. The director is a genius with extraordinary imagination and a fully grasp of animation movie making. The story is rooted from Chinese ancient myths Nezha. The fantastic adaptation couldn't have been better. It has gained mountains of positive comments in China. Desperately expect it will be watched by more and more people.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The following is not necessarily a review of the film, but a recount of my own viewing experience of this film.After months of rolling my eyes at the social media buzz about this supposedly ""great Chinese animation"", I finally found the one Regal theater in town that actually shows this movie. And I'm glad I did.Initially, I was turned off by this movie's trailer, since it had all the worst stereotypes of a Chinese-made film, with all the cheesy expositions, cringey dialogues, and awkward voice acting. I was so sure that ""Nezha"" was just another piece of garbage coming out of the money-grabbing film industry that had become so shamelessly greedy in recent years. But my low expectations were pleasantly subverted.After some struggling of finding a parking spot, I found myself in a relatively small-sized IMAX theater packed with young Chinese people, and a handful of white Americans, and one nice black lady who very much stood out in this crowd. And I'm almost certain that all of us enjoyed the two hours of fun and entertainment this film offered us, albeit on different levels.Almost immediately after the movie started playing, I found myself already irritated by the unnecessarily long opening credits of all the production companies associated with ""Nezha"". This is one of the many shady industry practices in China, where all the entities involved in the film's production process shamelessly tried to promote their brands, regardless of how much actual contribution they've made. But shortly after the actual film began to show on the screen, I was easily won over by the opening scene where the famous Daoist immortal ""Taiyi Zhenren"" was revealed to be an obese and seemingly incompetent idiot. It was a subversion of the genre trope. When it comes to the genre of Chinese mythology films, Daoist immortals were almost always portrayed as wise old men whose wisdom and authority are not to be questioned. And here in ""Nezha"", one of the most powerful and respected Daoist deities was portrayed as a buffoon who actually had real human personality.And at the same time, I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying the jokes and humors of the film, which I think is very rare in Chinese films. Even though I haven't watched any Chinese film for many years, I'm aware of the awfulness and cringiness of the typical attempts at comedy by trying to crack an awkward joke between scenes in Chinese films. But here in ""Nezha"", I enjoyed most of the comedy in it, even though I can see how goofy it is. Goofiness in film can be a good thing if it is done in the right tone.There are more turns and twists than I expected throughout the film, and I enjoyed the whole ride. However, I have to point out, there are one or two very brief moments in the film, which I didn't appreciate as much. I know the filmmakers were being serious in those brief moments, trying to evoke a certain emotion from audience. But it didn't work on me because of the voice acting in those scenes which took me right out of the film. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting was great in ""Nezha"", much better than most films. But in certain brief moments, it just didn't work for me.Now comes another possible issue of ""Nezha"", which might be an impediment to the general audience's enjoyment of this film. That is the English subtitles. I have to acknowledge that I myself could not do a better job than they did, at translating the Ancient Chinese mythological concepts into modern-day English while trying to make sense to an audience unfamiliar with Chinese culture at large. But I'd like to argue perhaps transliteration might be a better approach than imprecise translation. Also I have to point out, as with almost all foreign language films, the humors and multi-layered emotions of most dialogues in ""Nezha"" were inevitably lost in translation.Overall, ""Nezha"" was one of the best Chinese entertainment I've experienced in recent years, even though I haven't really watched that many real Chinese films. I'm glad that ""Nezha"" got a huge box office success in China which it so very much deserves. I'm not so sure ""Nezha"" would be a hit elsewhere. It might get popular to a certain degree on some streaming platforms. But I doubt it will get mainstream popularity in US, since most American media's portrayal of everything remotely related to China has been so negative lately ever since the Trade War.Anyway, for me, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Nezha"". But I don't know the experience would be the same for everyone, since you have to have a certain willingness to put up with imprecise translation while at the same time trying to be culturally open-minded.P.S. Sorry about my rambling in this long-ass review. But I can't believe I actually enjoyed a Chinese animation film so I have to take the time to write my genuine feelings about it.(Additional comments: CHINA was the nation that had once gave the world the absolutely worst garbage film series ever produced by mankind. I'm talking about, of course, the infamous ""Tiny Times"" series by the famed gay novelist Guo Jingming. Ever since my great suffering by Guo Jingming's garbage films, I had never ever given any Chinese-made films any sort of serious interest until the year 2019. At the beginning of this year, there was the surprise box office success, the ""Wandering Earth"", which I also enjoyed. And now I'm thoroughly won over by ""Nezha"". I think it's been a good year for the Chinese film-making and we shall see if it will last.)"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Very exotic while the aesthetic definitely wouldn't turn western audience off. Great animation, you can tell the budget is substantial, I would say that the production value is at least on par with Pixar. Surprisingly good film."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"...from my initial impressions. Thought it would be a bomb knowing nothing about the film judging by the trailer and poster, only interested in the mythology of Ne Zha. And damn, it was entertaining, fast paced full of slapstick humor and action, although the first few minutes had some slight cringe you might expect from a Chinese animation, but that quickly goes away.The visuals and 3d were spectacular. I'd say on the level of Dreamworks, somewhat near Pixar at times, although there were moments especially the dragons that were pretty bad, and 1 or 2 scenes that made my eyes spasm a bit from weird 3d movement. I first thought the initial character designs were like some weird Naruto-esk spinoff with the child NeZha looking a bit ugly, plus tropey action scenes. But it's one of those cases where watching it is much better than the lower quality trailers I came across, and none of the action was corny with emo characters trying too hard to act cool.The subtitles can pass by VERY fast and/or get lost against the background, so get ready to read fast. I'm left with some questions on the origin story which deviates a little from what I read, but there's enough to stay true to the mythos. There are even some moving, touching scenes with NeZha and his parents. Can't wait for the sequel which multiple end credits scenes point to."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I can find little fault in this production, and especially surprising how open & diverse the characters were for coming out of China. Storytelling was intelligent, sardonic, humorous, poignant. English voicing, often shaky in Asian films, was quite modern Western & culturally appropriate. Above all, the animation quality was nearly as good as it gets lacking only in individualized detail, but I didn't really miss it (e.g. in animals/humans the hair, skin subtleties were missing as well as detail in background objects). A huge plus were all the scenes, creatively conceived, I've never seen before in an animated film in this genre.My main criticism is the excessive time devoted to Ne Zha's worst behaviors."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"After seeing the posters and trailers, my first reaction was: nezha is so ugly. Feel ugly on the right, because this film is about to break the prejudice. As a lot of people look at this is diffuse, do not see; Or to see, see feel good also want to automatically deduct 20 points. In the movie, calling nezha a monster is politically correct. In addition to the film, scold domestic films, diffuse also become political correctness, as long as you scold it, someone will give you thumb up. In fact nezha is not a monster, he also wants to fall demon in addition to the devil wash name; Not all films are bad, but some people want to make a good film to prove themselves. Like nezha. The landscape of mountains and rivers is truly unrestrained and shocking. It embodies the objects that once existed only in the imagination and shows the infinite imagination of Chinese mythology incisively and vividly. Those familiar stories are no longer just stories, but can be seen, heard and enjoyed visually. With nezha this year and jiang ziya next year, the god movie universe is about to open. It's time to introduce Chinese culture to the world."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Fantastic animation, the storyline is a little diverted from the original ancient story but just as good. I almost burst into tears several times."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Some scenes felt drawn out, but the action and characters were awesome."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"There have been over 10 years since I go to the theater watching the Chinese garbage movies. This one really really changed my mind. I see a glimpse of light of the Chinese animation movies, and a fire for the whole Chinese movie industry."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Gorgeous and expressive characters, lush animation, dynamic action sequences, hilarious humour (some may argue it's juvenile but I enjoy Asian humour) and many touching scenes... I'll confess that at one point I was brought to tears. The highlight of the film for me was the pinball sequence. This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen.I've read reviews on here that criticize the English subtitles. On Netflix they seem fine."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Please watch the movie before you jump into any assumption, because this animation movie was born to challenge the concept of prejudice. With original materials from the ancient Chinese sagas, the story voiced the modern values of the Z generation instead of any of those cliches we've seen over and over again in recent movies. If you look closely, you could even find that the movie also tackled nowaday issues such as modern parenting, cyber bullying, etc. Also for example, some people even view the hero as a typical patient with bipolar disorder in terms of mental health. In conclusion, not only did the movie make great progress in animation design, but it also achieved great success in play writing, and has therefore set a great example for the Chinese animation industry."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"A complete and intelligent storyline, live characters, and lots lots of love. I cannot help but compare it to Wall-E, Toy Story 3, or Zootopia. It is as entertaining, touching, but also different. I can enjoy the movie fully because I am a native Chinese speaker, and I hope the translation can get the essence of the story, so more people can enjoy it. Recommend!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"It's so great to see this movie on show in NYC theaters! The story line one the best of its kind. I didn't like the look of Nezha at first glance, but I love it very much after seeing the movie. The story is very touching and completed. Love it and strongly recommended!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The Chinese cinema scene has had many gems, but historically these gems could only be found in relatively small budget independent productions. Diamonds in the rough, if you will. The Chinese blockbuster scene has long been... bleak, to say the least. But here we are, and it is in this context that I find the quality of this film to be kind of unbelievably good. The narrative structure, characters, writing, and animation are all astonishingly well done, and I was left particularly impressed by the very original interpretation of a classic folklore tale. The story of Ne Zha has been portrayed numerous times in the history of Chinese storytelling, yet this one did not obviously rehash them, which is a remarkable decision for a Chinese production. This film is a towering achievement for Chinese cinema."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This film proves that the Chinese animation industry is catching up to its Western counterpart. The animation quality is great, the story and setting are unique and the action is unrivaled. Main highlights include the battle between the two superpowered characters and the landscape inside the scroll. I was really surprised and impressed by this film. I hope to see more like this!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The story, animation, and characters are amazing. I recommend watching it in Mandarin as it was intended. With subtitles also of course. But I started it dubbed and hated how nothing matched with the lip movement and switched immediately. I almost always mess around on my phone during movies and I kept my phone on my stand next to my bed the whole time."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I speak very little Chinese, but I saw this film with my girlfriend (native speaker) at the cinema. She helped me understand plot points and certain dialogue that I was struggling with. This film is a great step in the right direction for the Chinese 3D animation industry, but in no way is it worthy of a 10/10. This film falls drastically short of the high bar set by films like those from Pixar.The good:-The landscapes and effects are bright and beautiful-The voice acting is solid-Some of the humor works even despite the language barrierThe bad:-Most of the characters look like they're from different movies. The juxtaposition between young/transformed Nezha, his parents, the bad guy and the villagers just feels off. This film would benefit from more consistent character design.-Some of the jokes are based more on Chinese meme culture, and as all of us know in the west, using memes in films is lazy pandering and sure to age very poorly.-There are some emotional cliches regarding sacrifice and character reactions to events in the film. These things have been done a million times before and they are not exceptional here at the least.All in all, I thought the film was decent. It was fun and looked a lot better than most 3D animation in China. But oh man are people riding the hype train on this one! It's really not a perfect or even great movie, but it is a step in the right direction. Hopefully Chinese films in the future will build off of this and produce films that are worthy of being called true classics, Chinese or worldwide."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Tianzun sends his disciples chubby Taoist Taiyi Zhenren, and Shen Gongbao to corral the Chaos Pearl. Tianzun splits the Chaos Pearl in two; the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb. The Demon Orb is birthed to be the demonic boy Ne Zha destine to be destroyed in three years. Meanwhile, Shen Gonbao steals the Spirit Pearl to the Dragon King who births his son Ao Bing to eventually release the dragons.This is Chinese animation getting better and better. It looks good and it looks fun. The story starts with an epic exposition dump. It's too complicated. It needs some simplification. It really only needs to get to Hellboy and Iceman. The characters are the more important aspect. The most compelling part is the demonic nature of Ne Zha and the fear that he instills upon the villagers. It's a personal interior battle that plays out to the end with him and Ao Bing. The movie needs to streamline the story as much as possible to that aspect. The more complicated it gets, the more de-emphasized is that personal struggle."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This movie has broken record, so my expectation is quite high. And in the end it really meets my expectation. The story is well told, and it made people laugh every other minutes, but at some point it made you think about family and love, and you just cant stop crying. I enjoyed every minute of it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This is a very good looking animated film. The various special effects are very exquisite, the language is humorous and full of emotions, but it is not in English, which is not conducive to the audience to better understand the story. The Chinese flavor of the plot is strong, and the overall feeling is still very good."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This film proves that Chinese animated films can be as good as their Western counterparts. The animation quality is great, the story and setting are unique and the action is unrivaled. Main highlights include the landscape inside the scroll and the battles. I was really surprised and impressed by this film. I hope to see more like this!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"It has strong morals and an unpredictable plot, but some parts may come off a little too preachy and repeating."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"An impressive animation which portraits two typical Chinese from new generation.Ne Zha is a second generation from a rich and high rank Chinese army family( a family of the army leader parents in Chentang in the movie). His parents are very busy with their career( have no time to play with Ne Zha in the movie), have no time to be with their child, and take all their child's mistakes to be their responsibilities( hardly punish Ne Zha in a traditional Chinese way but isolate him in the movie, the father even plans to die for saving his son's life in the movie).Ao Bing is a nice young man from a far more traditional Chinese village( dragons in the bottom of the sea in the movie) . The village and villagers have been mistreated in the fast Chinese economic growth and left behind wounded( dragons have all been cursed at the bottom of the sea and have no power to escape in the movie) . Ao Bing has a huge expectations from his father and master and tries to take their expects to climb up to the top of the social pyramid.The villagers' fear, hatred and prejudice to Ne Zha symbolised the public's fear to the new generation of Chinese new elites especially from an army background family. The Chinese thought those new elites had sin before their born. The sin has not been discussed clearly in the movie but is well known to the public. The sin is power, wealth and privilege in the Chinese society.Ne Zha and Ao Bing could also have been seen as two sides of China. They are like Yin and Yang in the Bagua. Both Ne Zha and Ao Bing have evilness and goodness inside them. The collaboration of Ne Zha and Ao Bing indicated a harmony to society.The discourse in the movie is not political correctness like a lot of audiences outside China would think. ""No one but yourself could decide who you are"" is a common rebellion idea to Chinese in its social revolutions and political movements. What is new in the movie is actually: people from rich and privileged, as well as people from poor and wounded have distructional power in the society, but if they work together, the destruction could turn into a harmony in the future."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"What a beautifully and impressively animated movie! Camera work, design, colors and animations.. You can easily compare it to the level of quality of a Disney movie.Yet.. I'm torn between disappointment on the unnecessary dumbing-down and childish presentation of most characters and developments prior to the 1-hour mark of the movie VS the excitement and content after Ao Bing first appeared. It feels like the tone of the movie is completely different after that point (still hsa it's moments, though).Much like ""Jiang Ziya"" or ""Legend of Deification"" (the prequel that came after it), it acquires a more straightforward-structure with cleaner/focused dialogue and a story with no nonsense just for the sake of it. I can see a great movie underneath the disappointing foundation (there's farts, eating boggers and the likes), with an otherwise fulfilling middle(?) & final act. It's a shame to see the first half to be kind of wasted opportunity to give the viewer a memorable and concise introduction to this world. For a believable friendship between rivals, a better exploration of the relationship with the townsfolk, and with ample opportunity for some ""more"" in that space that was squandered.I guess it was made with children in mind.. but still. If they really want to make a cinematic universe, they should make something smart that appeals to everyone.. and ""Jiang Ziya"" feels like a step in the right direction."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"After the White Snake, Monkey King, now Nezha is coming as new/best one of these series.Nice job.BTW it only comes with English subtitle, and mannnnnny funny point are sadly lost by translation. But it's still worth enough to watch."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Due to the film's high ratings I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately - despite every effort - I was disappointed.Let's face it, the animation is awesome! The slow motion scenes are fantastic, as if watching a big budget superhero movie. The premise itself is interesting, as well. However, the execution left me shaking my head in disappointment. There's so much silliness that I just wasn't interested. Even dramatic scenes were suddenly ruined by the ever-present slapstick humor - similar to a kiddies cartoon.With a mature theme like good versus evil - and demons - its interesting that they opted to go the slapstick route, which would appeal more to a younger demographic. Young children also won't really understand the concept of good and evil as portrayed here. Also, I'm certain the Chinese will find this more relatable than we ever can, due to their myths, gods and beliefs. Christians will most certainly view this as blasphemous. As for me, I just found it uninteresting and silly. Ne Zha - supposedly the film's anti-hero hero - is one of the most unlikable characters seen in a while in an animated film. I didn't root for him at all.The creators really allowed their imaginations to run away with them on this one...maybe too much..."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"First thing first, DO YOU ALL OF THAT FIGHT SCENE? man thats move was something.must be planed really well.The story was good, its seems like expected but their put a little touch so its feels really fresh. I like the comedy sense was really consistence till the end of story. The portion of that comedy was great too, almost perfect for me personally.Great animation detail, even tho there's a couple that still stiff but who care? its already beautiful. Great emotion delivery. That Ne Zha grow up form was FIRE ! i mean literally FIRE. Lol"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This movie has grossed 4.1 billion yuan in China! (Don't ask me why I know) I have a Chinese nearby who flew to his hometown specially to see. She told me that it is really very nice! ! ! (Although the production cost is only 60 million RMB), many stars have imitated it on China's microblog, which shows that it is very popular!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"First of all, I must say it's the best Chinese movie ever! I also stress it's best from China, and based on Chinese culture. So I don't feel surprised that many westerners don't understand or like this movie. But I insist to recommend you to watch if you have interest in China or Chinese culture, of course also if you like to enjoy the good movie.We all have our vision to the world based on different culture and religion, which makes the world colorful and splendid. So we respect the difference of each culture. As I remember, when I saw some heroical movies such as Batman, it made me sleepy. There are many other examples of this. After some years, I know more and more western cultures, I began to like some American movies, although there are still some that never could be my taste.All in all, I just want to say, don't feel surprise many people like this movie but you don't. If you haven't watch it, I recommend you to."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I watched the film once and then I re-watched it immediately afterwards by fast-forwarding to see if I missed anything.Pros:-Animation is a 10/10.-Voice acting - no complaints.-Themes: there were some strong themes such as antihero, hero, loneliness and self-sacrifice, to name a few, that gave the story depth and evoked emotions from me and surely the other viewers.Con:-Story: The writers Yi Qiao and Wei Yunyun wrote the story's climax far too late into the story. but even worse, they distastefully failed to give the viewers the kind of ending we would have all wanted.Verdict:-Animation 10/10. Story 8/10. Lost -2 points for the reason given above. Thus: it gets a 9/10 from me. It is a great film, go watch it. I will still watch the sequel which will come out in 2020 at some point, which I hope has a better ending."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Nothing to say, CHONG JIU WAN SHI LE ,the box office will be exceed 5 billion.CHONG CHONG CHONG"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"We have seen a lot of Chinese films that are very attracting to the audience recently years. It's quite a big improvement to the Chinese film industry. But that's not enough if they want to go much further. Cause what most audience wants is not just higher quality productions but also more reasonable story plots. In fact, an absurd or even preposterous story will ruin an outstanding film production, just like The Wandering Earth. As the same, this film does have such an exceptional fine animation but the storylines are just kinda poor. What they should really do are putting more time to conceive an acceptable story for the audience. That would not just only be going to help themselves but also to the whole film industry. Cause in this huge competition, there will always be a better feature film instead of being worse."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I dont like cartoons actually, but it is said that this is is soooo good. So i decided to give it a try and it turns out to be an awesome movie. Worth the ticket and highly recommend watching it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,Best Chinese animation ever! It makes you laugh and cry.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The exquisite and affectionate friendship and portrayal, the bright picture, the anti-traditional surprise story, and the exciting lines. Very worthy of the whole family."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This is the best animated film that I ever see. The 3D effect is awsome. The storyline is changed from the traditions. However, it has introduce Chinese culture to the world. I can use my words to show the excellent of this film."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Was hestitate to see this movie at first cause of keeping remake of Mokey god sun wukong too many time, different characters but same myth story. Afraid it's was another China patriotic feelings after Earth wandering incident. The first 3 min introduction make me think Its stun me after seeing it, the origin Nezha story change to something meaningful, beautiful Graphic, very long time haven't seen so much laughter in cinema.U have to know some Chinese culture to catch some of the jokes inside, but it's ok even u can't get it. Still a must watch movie of the year.."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This presentation is from the point of view of a parent to a child and a child to mythical travail. A curse or a gift? With wage in the community for it's safety, the village will need help from this mythic child. The story has a odd ending but seems to present the possibility of a sequel."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Quite funny and has a touch of emotions. Old legend, with a lot of references in the younger generations... unfortunate that they run out of money in the end, so the ending is a bit rush.Worth thr money and time!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"It's a cartoon based on traditional Chinese myth, but I personally think it's as deep as Zootopia, in this movie, it discusses prejudices against stereotypes and self-identity under hatred, and made me think a lot about racial and gender discrimination.""If fate isn't fair, fight it till the end."" I cried all over the second half of this movie. As a minority of being Asian and woman in male-dominated tech industry, I can totally relate."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,I just finished watching this movie and it was lit! I definitely recommend this movie. It's wonderful!
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This is truly the new Era of, not only the Chinese Animation Industry, but the whole CHINESE TV AND FILM INDUSTRY!!! Despite the awesome, fantastic 3D animation and visual effects, the plot is amazing and flawless, there were a few moments that the people in the movie theater all teared up, and there were moments that people just couldn't stop laughing. I highly recommend this movie to all of you, even if you are not familiar with the Chinese myths and legends, you won't be disappointed."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Solid story (7)Good music and foley mixer (8)Animation is spectacular with vibrant colours, believable animated motion capture and spectacular cinematography (props, set design, weather effects) (9)"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I just watched ""Nezha"" and it was one of my most favorite movies I have seen in the past year. The animation was extremely well made, with only a few frames where an effect was not lined up with the object, but other than that, it was amazing.The movie was able to invoke emotion within me, which is something that not even ""Infinity War"" was able to do."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Before I watched this animation, Nezha Zhi Mo Tong Jiang Shi, I've seen in a lot of reviews that Nezha is very ugly. I kind of agreed with them until I knew the reason why they decided to create him that way instead of cute and handsome kind of kid. It's because of who he is. So, I no longer think that Nezha is so ugly.I kind of had a high hope for this animation because I've seen a lot of people were saying that this animation was so popular in China and a lot of people created a lot of accounts on Weibo. So, as long as I've seen it's out, I immediately watched it.Nezha is one of my favourite animations as I was a kid. I've seen animation series about him when I was a kid. To this day, I still have that animation series on DVD. I really love Nezha story. That's also the reason why I watched this animation. But when I watched this animation, I found that it's a bit different from what I've saw. Still, it's not that bad.This Nezha animation is kind of a good animation. They put some jokes between scenes. Some scenes are funny. I laughed out loud. Comedy is good, but sometimes, it makes the film less serious. Moreover, Nezha's mother character isn't that good. The way she talks in some scenes is kind of offensive. So, the character development needs to be better. I'm not saying that it's bad. But as for the one who loves to see more serious, I kind of want to see more serious than this.Although this animation is quite good, but most of the characters are not that much pretty. So, if they made those characters cute, I think it'd be better.All in all, this animation shows about the friendship. I really love to see it. Furthermore, it shows parents' love on their kids. When I saw that scene, I was touched and cried. The plot is quite simple, but it turned out to be a good animation. And I really love this animation. Hence, yeah, I've enjoyed it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"An emotional roller coaster in a wonderland.Visuals, characters, clever jokes, actions, emotional scenes.. wonderful."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This was epic animation at it's best. A tale of overcoming prejudice, finding unusual friendship and deciding your own fate. My eyes have never watered up watching animation but this one did it.....yeah it's that's good. It's Feb of 2020 and this has been by far the best film I have downloaded and watched since the year has come in. Do I recommend? Hell to yes! A story that clearly defines the meaning of not to judge a book by it's cover. A story we all can relate to."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"For a childrens film, this is such a sad movie. I was malling my eyes out like an hour in. I really recommend this."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Reluctantly give 7 stars and encourage the country. The special effects are basically up to standard, but the script will go back and polish for 10 years. ""Mother-in-law is more and more defeated"", unprincipled indulgence of bear children destroying property; trying to reflect the prejudice in people's minds, but adding a lot of regional elements to the characters from the entertainment."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I read the overwhelming positive reviews here, and thought oh boy; Im in for a treat! What a absolute let down.The artistic designs for the characters was utterly atrocious. The CGI overall was just...not good. The storyline was boring. The voice acting was bad. I really just have nothing positive to say about htis, and I am truly baffled how anyone would."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"There was a wemon living in a truck. Flat tires dented headlights, a piece of string hanging from her beltloop that went off into the forest. She would pull on it and then she finally snipped it off. But then retied it. What we were not supposed to know: each day a blank piece of red paper was burnt by one of the characters."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"All the special effects are well done. The storyline is better than most of movies out there. Incredible. Will be better if you have some cultural insight and reference, but great movie!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Most ppl can't understand the story because it contains massive Chinese culture. Nezha, was born in Shang dynasty, helped King Zhouwu destroyed Shang dynasty and founded Zhou dynasty and listed in saga list. According to Chinese myth, Nezha was born with super power, fighting evils. After killing Aobing (he was evil dragon), the dragon king was upset and give out the word that either Nezha gotta die or the whole tribe(or city, I am not sure which one) will be destroyed. So Nezha cut his own throat at front of king dragon. And his father uses lotus and lotus root bring Nezha back to life. That's pretty much the original story of Nezha. Some ppl may have different version because Nezha had appeared on religious legend, monster novel, etc.The name of Nezha was originally from Buddha India, aka Nuzad or Nalakuvara(in Sanskrit). And we can see, lotus symbols Buddha supreme sacred object. Nezha become popular during Ming dynasty and with thousands yrs of word of mouth, the story is A LOT different to this movie. But still, I love this movie. Director changed the story so they can add many elements and issues which we are experiencing right now. Making the story easier to understand and lol. And at the end of the movie, director apparently dug a hole and sequel is just matter of time.Overall, this is best Chinese animation so far, and I am expecting more to come. And trust me, many many legend myth/culture will be presented to you."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"There are not only solid scripts, but also excellent special effects and soundtrack. It is really a mature Chinese animation film. At first, I saw the movie trailer on the Internet, which was too deceitful. I was shocked by the image of Nezha's black eyes and hoarse voice. I thought it was just a plain myth re adaptation. As a result, I was shocked by the movie in the cinema. Let me laugh for a while, let me cry for a moment. Li Jing and his wife are so kind. Apart from their kindness, they have been insisting on outputting positive energy to Nezha. Li Jing's saying ""he is my son"" stimulates the lacrimal gland too much. The little details of the screenwriter are very distracting. That invitation is very warm. The six armed Nezha is so handsome! The background music when lifting the ice is too hot!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"""So, for audience who are au fait of the mythology, the plot is bold enough to reimagine Ne Zha as a recalcitrant, mean-spirited troublemaker, his sulky, feral appearance is diametrically different from the usual image of a young, plucky hero. And Ao Bin, his arch enemy in the original story, comes off as a regal prince, but his heart-of-gold is also encumbered with a predestined vocation. Ne Zha's demonic nature means, when push comes to shove, he has no qualms about laying into the innocent lesser mortals, as for Ao Bin, the Spirit Pearl cannot preclude him from decimating an entire village to uphold his mission.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I just watched Nezha in theater and I loved it very much! It has spectacular graphics, great voice acting, interesting plot and well paced story telling. Although it is based on popular Chineses mythology tales, the movie adds some changes and twists to the stories to make it more fun and unpredictable. The director tells the story from an angle about prejudice , fate and friendship, which I think is something that everyone can relate to. Overall, it is a blast to watch this great movie and I highly recommend it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The story, animation, characters and English-language voice-dubbing are all good. The English subtitles are terrible and do not at all match the voice-dubbing.There are a lot of 10-star ratings on here. I don't know if they're legit or ""part of the production team"" reviews... but I can see why people would rate this highly. The animation was top-notch. For me though, the ending was sudden and anti-climatic, which was a disappointment. A stronger ending would have made this a much better film. Evidently it was designed to introduce a follow-up film... which is a really bad idea if that film has not yet been produced.Overall it was an interesting and enjoyable watch, but had a let-down final scene. These production companies need to learn how to do a proper job at subtitle translation. We see too many of these films that look like they used Google Translate to do the job for them."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Great movie with outstanding animation, appealing even to adults. The jokes are really harsh and strong for children, so please keep it in mind. Watched in original chinese version and sounds a lot better. Unfamiliar with the casts but all were well casted, matched properly with the characters design and attitudes. Great villain potrayal and nezha seems to be antihero rather than a hero himself. Im very familiar with nezha's lore and the variation but this is something new, nothing similar with the troublesome yet kind hearted nezha i know from the myth. Highly recommended. Its funny, packed with action, great character development, family value/relationship, few adventurous moments."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Reviews that give this a 10 are delusional or paid shills, because this is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.Many parts of the film are just foolishness, as though thought up by a 5 year old. They seem to be there for the sole purpose of keeping the audience awake.Overall it's just a sloppy film, in my opinion, of course. I did watch it twice, first in English then again in Chinese with English subtitles. It didn't clear up too much the second time around. Perhaps some exposition was left on the cutting room floor?I also noticed some framing issues here and there, not sure what that is about."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,One of the best anime/cartoon films I've ever watched.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"For Chinese movie watchers, Nezha is definitely a landmark work. As for the quality, I think the box office of the movie with a break of 5 billion yuan is enough to show that, believe me, it's worth the ticket price and recommend watching"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I reallllly love this movie!This is the best Chinese anime I have ever saw!I like Ne Zha, Ao Bing, and Shen Gong Bao.I am looking forward to see Ne Zha 2!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,The film boldly subverts the original and gives people a fresh feeling. The core of the whole story is to break stereotypes.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,Completely mind blowing. The animation was superb and better than anything I have ever seen thus far
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,A humorous yet deep story and stunning animation. Good for all ages.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Really want to write a review for that excellant movie. it make me laugh and cry.Ne Zha (2019)'s graphic design, 3d animation and the fight scene are so outstanding, world class level. bring a new era for chinese animation.great adaptation of the chinese legend story, beyond expectation.great bro romance,family romance, funny and touching.the story also bring out meaningful value, the movie deserve to win best 2019 animation movie in the world.with the high box office in china, looking forward sequel happen!!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"What is the great innovation of china mythical!In my memory. The little naza has appointed hero form he was born,then he fight for truth immortal.anythings he did that presented justice.the little nazha is so beautiful,people like him, who is benevolence.but it not like real social.its surprise to watch naza 2019.his editor creature the character whith morden.the nazha is so clean from he was born,even if he has presented demon.than his mom teach the value to him.his parents protect him.it's so fortunate to naza for he defeat himself in the end.what a amazing shout!I control my own life!it not judge by the god!the anime is chinese series immortal story.In the movie end,naza is dead,I admit it maybe not cool for whom has not study chinese culture.however,in the chinese immortal story,naza will be regeneration by his master used the lotus makes a body.as for me,it's outstanding.I hope that Chinese animation will be better and better.so i score it 10."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"To be honest, I didn't expect the movie to be so good when I persuaded my husband to watch it with me. I only went there because I've heard so many good things about it. And it didn't fail me.There were tears and laughs. There were creativity and some stereotype.If I have to find some negativeness, the translation might be a bit difficult for people who don't understand Chinese since there were lots of Chinese culture in the movie. But that can be fascinating! Even for me, who's a through and through Chinese, I had to look up some of the nouns later after watching the movie."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"One element of criticism of the film is its background, the myth on which the film is based is very familiar to the Chinese, because of cultural differences, I believe it is difficult for foreign audiences to understand the film. For me, as a normal audience, I admit that the film is a step forward for Chinese animation, but its flaws are also obvious, it's certainly not perfect to point of 10."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I thought it is just a movie for kid, with action, and good vs bad. But I was wrong, Ne Zha isn't your usual movie hero. There are also many funny moments through out the film, kudos to the writers and animators."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The computer graphics are terrific and the best part of this film. The story seems to wander at times and the development of the two demon characters could be better. However, you can look forward to a spectacular conclusion."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,I really love this animation. It's the best one so far this year.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Best movie this year. If the Font Size of subtitles can be a little bit large, that's would be better to catch up."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Never give up on a fate, we have our own's life choices.Laugh, then cry, a movie that has a family drama, a movie that will show you a bad side of bullying, a movie that has a moral story in it. And it all packed cleverly into an animation movie.Some of the comedy is misplaced, but I'm sure this just a personal opinion, but it annoys me."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,Quite a great comedy cartoon. Somehow the matured Natra appearance really looks like Songoku
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"It's an amazing Chinese Animation!Adapted from famous Chinese folklore, with lots of fun and passion."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"In a year of both surprises and disappointments, Ne Zha has become a welcome experiment in animation, though I am shocked by how much money it earned in China alone. Due to my watching of many Asian-inspired movies, IMDB continuously put this movie in my reccomendations, and I am so glad it did!I will get the negatives out of the way first. The lip sync for the english dub is pretty off, especially for the demon goblin by the sea. The ending, regarding the lightning, while quite the spectacle, was a bit nonsensical in a multitude of ways. And weirdly enough, I wish the father had more emotion in the animation itself. He is so stoic that when he is being heartbreaking in the voice performance, his facial expressions don't capture the sorrow in his voice. The biggest problem I have, similar to the Monkey King movie a few years back, is the humor. The humor is so childish and based around the gross-out style that it felt off, especially during the climax when the survival of the main characters depended on a fart (no I am not joking). It just felt so juvenile, and distracted from the story.The action is fluid and pretty easy to follow, and the magic is very mystical. The final battle and every scene with the dragons were highlights for me, emphasizing the epic scale of everything. The animation is also pretty gorgeous, and while I am not a fan of the character designs (except for Ao Bing and the General), I can at least admit there is a better variation of designs in this than even Frozen II. The motivations of every character are well set-up. Ne Zha's mother wants to spend time with him, keep him safe, and make sure that she can promote goodwill on behalf of her son, for her son. The General is busy, but cares about his son from afar. Ne Zha has been called a demon his whole life, and has been sheltered to the point where he feels imprisoned. Ao Bing wants to save his people, but knows little of the consequences that come with defying them. I can forgive any ""dumb"" mistakes made by Ne Zha and Ao Bing because technically they are still 3 year olds. I also really enjoy the scene where the two of them play the game by the beach in the sunset. The ending is sad, but still epic. And the after-credits scenes hint that there will be a sequel to this.I reccomend this movie to anyone with children, or fans of Chinese legends and movies. You will laugh and cry (though I didn't), and the message of not letting a definite fate define how others see you is touching and well-handled. They don't technically cop-out on the two protagonists still being alive, which is appreciated (again, even Frozen II didn't manage that). I hope more Chinese animations like this are made. I am excited for their next movie, Jiang Ziya, or""The Legend of Deification""."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"No more hope for Chinese animations! There's no good! Chinese culture can only be worse than shown. They think everything ought to go as supposed, thinking the older the better.The country is too poor to have only the history and culture with most sins."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"You won't get any surprise here but the quality(in general) is pretty good. One comment to people who complain about subtitles and give bad rating :at least you guys should try to adapt. I mean movie from China mostly have subtitles. When I come to Canada, watch movies with no subtitles and in English I can still distinguish which one is good and which one is bad."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Funny and touching at the same time, I think it's worth the time"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"First of all i need to say this,i have seen lot of reviews here and i feel troubled. if feels like the someone pay some person to put ratings . i am writing this to make this clear and let people know truth and let them know that real Chinese culture is better than this.first of all let me tell the good things good effects and good quality(seems like lot of money on the effects).The bad is actually everything else. story doesn't make sense and what we can get from this story. it's no meaning here. lot of people say its about bad can be good. but it doesn't expressed in the story properly because nezha wasn't bad from the beginning just only the born part and also bad become good doesn't show any specific beneficial in the end. only the society is bad itself and it's making nezha angry. relationship between nezha and dragon feels weird its like a gay story. nezha says lot of bad words and this movie is not suitable for kids. nezha putting his hand into that teacher's pant to take stuff is weird in lot of ways. what he did or learn for two years is nothing. they put lot of funny parts in wrong places like when nezha's mom motherly love towards nezha. its very wrong to make fun of human feelings like this.my recommendation is if you want to watch effects go for it. others nothing. normally i believe good story and what it gives to the society is what matters most and we use good graphics and effects to make it express well. not making bad story to look good by good graphics. so in the it it becomes waste of money and time. i am so disappointed."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I'm seeing all of these reviews saying that the movie is funny, tear-inducing, etc., but I don't see it. The story was formulaic, the humor was excessively juvenile, and I barely connected with any of the characters. Frankly, I was siding with the ""villains.""The one definite positive is the animation, which is especially impressive during the fight scenes.If you're interested in a barebones story with good animation, give it a watch (though I'd recommend the original audio with English subtitles. Having the mouth movements not match the words was very distracting)[Edit: I'm willing to believe most of this movie's problems are a result of the English dub, but I don't care enough to watch this movie again to see for myself if that is true]"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Except for lip sync, every thing was so nice. nice story and conflict, nice lighting and rendering..."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The score and the visuals of this movie are superb! I loved seeing the colors, the contrasts, and the way the music really helped bring it to life. You can tell that the production team really wanted to do well in bringing out a magical fantasy world for viewers.My biggest complaint is with the writing of the story. Most of the story seems to be a slice of life without any build up until perhaps half way through. We know that Ne Zha is on a timeline, but the process of him getting there is unclear. Additionally, the 3 year timeline is rather strange. Are we to assume that he is 3 at the end of the movie, or is he magically older due to the magic inside him? It's rather unclear, and becomes even more unclear when Ao Bing shows up as a teenager. Both of whom were born at the same time. Ao Bing is introduced near the beginning as the would be antagonist/savior of the dragons/apprentice to Sheng Gong Bao(?) then disappears for majority of the film. And when he re-emerges to provide the opposition, his part in the story doesn't help the story move forward. (Honestly the only thing moving this story is that NeZha is supposed to die and everyone is coping with it differently).Furthermore, Ao Bing is the hope of his people to be free from their imprisonment. This seemed to have been a real big part to the conflict and would hopefully have some kind of resolution at the end. But this subplot is dropped at the end of the lightning blast, as if it wasn't ever mentioned. Yeah okay, NeZha ""changed his destiny"" but Heaven still ultimately got what it wanted because NeZha is technically dead, and the dragons are still in prison because Ao Bing is also technically dead.The conflict of the plot comes to an abrupt conclusion but no real resolution in a meaningful way. Sure, everyone comes to take a knee at the end, but if anything, this is a classic Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer moment: no body likes him until he became useful."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,My fate is decided by myself.This sentence encouraged me.Never be shameful and afraid.you can be best.
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I held no expectations when I entered the cinema as I thought it was a movie for kids even though the trailer looked epic with it's animations. However, this movie swept me off my feet! The animations were amazing, the fighting scenes, everything!Not to mention, it brought me on a emotional rollercoaster, it was super touching ,brought me to tears several time, it also made me laugh so hard that I cried. The ending song was marvelous as well. It teaches you about not taking fate as it is, friendship and family.This was the most epic and best movie I've watched this year and is definitely not to a movie to be missed this 2019!It caters to all age groups as it was evident that the whole cinema which consisted of young children, teenagers, young adults and the elderly were all very entertained and loved the movie as much as I did.In one sentence, epic and not to be missed!!looking forward to part 2 in 2020!!!!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I never write any review, but this is an exception, as I think this movie deserves better attention. If it is made by Pixar or Disney, I believe it would even stand a chance of being nominated for the Academy Awards, as many animated movies that have won aren't not as good as this (of course there are other well-deserved winners from those studios). I have watched many animated movies, and my favorites are from Ghibli (Japan), and Ne Zha to me is on par with other movies like Spirited Away, Kaguya Hime, Totoro etc. The story is refreshing and very creative, the characters are adorable, and the art is excellent.Anyway, I don't want to add any spoiler, I just want to say go see the movie for yourself, and judge it before coming to any conclusion from any negative review. This movie is truly a gem. The Chinese animation industry should be proud of it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"The story of the movie is different than usual. I think people who are interested in different myths would like it more. Also, the quality of animation was awesome. The story was interesting and the movie was exiting. I loved it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"I watched the trailer of this movie, and having a feeling that it has an interesting story. Then when i watched it, it's amazing all the animation movement, face expression and the story itself. so, i gave 10 score for this movie."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Don't believe the nationalistic reviews. Better than Pixar, not even close, but nice try. My kids would be bored. I agree, best technically Chinese cg animated film, but not as good as what's done by Koreans, Japanese and Hollywood, keep trying."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"But the problem is... The freaking subtitle will blow your brains out, it's like decoding the entire story from start to finish! Feels like your starting to learn English while still in your mom's tummy lol!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,Great story. Great characters design.Great pictureVery smooth and perfect story.They got me with even little details they put in the movie.I love how the movie made me feel so into every single characters. This is the first movie in these years that made me cry with sadness and happiness overflow all over me!!!
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Ne Zha was a well-known cartoon last year, so it is no wonder that it became a successful film now. It focuses on a demon who fell on Earth, but is unwelcomed by the people of the town. Subsequently, he tries to gain their acceptance by doing good deeds, however, the residents are suspicious of Ne Zha's motives and mistake him to have bad intentions due to his demonic nature. Generally, this film revolves around Ne Zha trying show to the people of the town how he is a good-natured individual and there are many twists and turns on the way.Watching Ne Zha will be a very refreshing experience. In the film, the filmmakers changed a lot of things, such as Ne Zha being friends with the villains. Contrary to the story in the book, the purpose of the dragons had also changed; in the film, they existed as they needed to imprison the sea monsters, whereas, they were nobles in the book. In addition, this film had plenty of modern jokes that cartoon series may have lacked, so there are a lot of humorous references you will identify with.While I believe Ne Zha is an impressive film, there are a few things which can be improved. For example, the transition from one scene to another is too abrupt and needs to be more fluid. However, overall, it is a film that I would definitely recommend watching and give it 8/10 stars as it is comparatively better than other films in the Chinese market."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Although a good movie, being rated PG on Netflix probably isn't appropriate. A higher rating or atleast a warning would have been preferred. We made it 35 mins in before we shut it down. If my kids were a tad older we could've continued. Otherwise it was a funny movie for what we saw of it."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Watched this on Netflix not knowing anything about it other than the trailer. I was expecting a pretty good movie but boy was I wrong. This movie was great. The animation, story line and action was above expectation. The characters had emotion and depth that the artist conveyed wonderfully. Though it is an old story of 'You determine who you wanna be', it was delivered with a freshness of emotion and passion I was not expecting. Thanks for making a great movie I can share with my children and grand kids."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"If fate isn't fate with you, fight it till the end.An animation movie which includes all types of emotions!"
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"This movie was recommended on my kids Netflix profile. Great movie all around the movie plot is very imaginative and exciting. Now its a household favorite, highly recommend."
哪吒,Ne Zha (2019),,2019,2019.08.29,"Script, Story, dialogue, making was superb. But VFX is so so & also Editing looking good."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Let just get this out of the way. I am not Chinese and I am not a student of Chinese history. While watching I can understand that it will invoke a lot of emotions to people who have lived through these events but for outsiders it will have less of an impact. This is unavoidable so bear that in mind when you go to watch it.Now that being said, I rather enjoyed it. It is very well made with a lot of attention to detail. I've been told that the representation of the people and the way things were back then (clothes, TVs etc) are very accurate. So while we can get the nostalgia of it we can see more about China's history.I am a bit confused as it mixes history with stories so it's hard to know how accurate it is. (for example the first story is about a real person while the second may or may not have happened)Also as its seven stories in does feel a bit too rushed in character development. It is understable but for me makes it feel more forced than I would have liked.Overall, I'd say watch it for the history and maybe it will make you interested enough to dig further yourself into China's history.Things of note,I finally found a Chinese child actor I thought as greatThey have a story similar to capt marvel but done better"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,Good movie. I was deeply moved. The third story made me cry.An improvement too.
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"The relatively best of the seven is Ning Hao's ""Hello Beijing"" and Guan Hu's ""Eve"". The two directors have extensive commercial film experience. Their stability is precisely because they have adopted the most classic and traditional dramas. mode. Ning Hao chose the character-driven arc to show the dramatic tension. Although the plot development is strongly predictable and outdated, it has to be said to be the most complete. Only the taxi driver played by Ge You in the seven departments is The most humanized and closest to the lives of citizens, the unique sense of market humor in Ning Hao's movies minimizes stereotypes here, so ""Hello Beijing"" can even be said to have author characteristics.Play""Little people in big events"" or ""little people meet big events"" are not only about methodology but also about values.AudiovisualClose-ups, slow motion, and music rendering are overused, like TV specials.themeIn addition to ""national power"", should we also show ""people's wealth""?"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"To sacrifice your love, family and everything, just to make the government LOOK GOOD even it's dirty and rotten inside? And this is something to be proud of and cry for? I honestly don't see the point here, but at least we can see how far someone can go after getting brainwashed. Probably nowadays only people from China and Northern Koreans will feel for this film."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"To preface my review: I don't believe in going easy on a film while reviewing it just because I may not be a member of its intended audience from a national or racial perspective. A film director, or in the case of this specific film, directors, should always anticipate that their audience might be diversified, regardless of intentions or agendas. This is especially the case if the movie is being played in my local theater and my girlfriend (who is from a country that rhymes with Bo-Bina) is taking me to see it.My People, My Country is a movie about people and a country (big surprise there huh?), during the aftermath of a specific political shift of a very beautiful and culturally and historically rich nation. It comprises of seven short films made through the charitable efforts of seven separate directors. It's largely historical, with some events being fictitious purely for characterization.MPMC is literally ""Flag Waving: The Movie"". After the halfway mark your eyes will be coated in red lenses and you'll be seeing yellow stars while you sleep. Did you know that raising a flag in complete sync with a national anthem is apparently life or death important? This movie really wants you to know that by having two of its seven short films centering completely around that. Movies should be entertaining, and if you're lucky, enlightening. They are not supposed to be two plus hour long authoritarian glory ads.On a technical level MPMC is all over the place. Any computer generated effects looked about two decades old, and the sound mixing was off with people talking over one another, or sounding closer or farther away than they actually were. Subtitles were mostly good with only a handful of grammatical errors in some lines. There were also instances of what sounded like German or Eastern European actors doing very poor jobs of English accents while portraying the British personnel during the 1997 Hong Kong Exit portion of the film. I've noticed unrelated Chinese made shows and movies do this before and it's as hilarious as it is irritating to witness.I really don't have much positive to say about this film other than the story of the taxi driver in Beijing in 2008 was very charming and well done. Kudos to the director of that short, and to the main actor who was a ray of sunshine in an otherwise dreary slog of patriotic fluff. Those efforts comprise of my two points out of a ten for ""My People, My Country"""
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"First off all I'm not Chinese, but I did enjoyed this movie very much. I should give 9 star for it, but the extra star is for the Chinese people. All the stories was very moving, except the last one.China has a great history and of course, they are proud for them country. It is not a propaganda movie, just make they citizens love China more and nothing wrong with that.If you looking for political propaganda, you should look in the mirror!This move made $300 million dollars in six days, but here , just shows $2 million profit ""world wide?!"". Why the Chinese gross isn't including the World?What is it, if not political propaganda against China.Also nobody mentioned, all the actors and directors made it for free.All the proceeds goes to the poor people and it is true, not BS!Think about, how great the people's are in China, how much they achieved in 70 years, started almost from nothing!"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"If I'm not Chinese I would probably give it a one-star. Every plot is made to force people to feel emotional, even when the story is so undeveloped. There's tooooo much politics in this film. I get it, this is a big thing, we are a great country. But at the same time, this theme is so repetitive, I can literally write a commentary essay on this without watching the film.It's really ironic how if you comment negatively about this movie on a Chinese website, and people go like ""OMG are you even Chinese"" ""Well, this whole point is for us to remember the history, and know our own country well.""If so, why is the film so BADLY made??? Why is the theme so overused, I could guess the ending before the film actually ends.A good intention, but a trash film."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Motherland birthday Eve of the urgent, and his girlfriend met the moment, to see that the day meteor, escort responsibility. Are telling stories about themselves and their country. The film's seven stories, seven directors, many actors can be said to be very good groups. Seventy years of history condensed in a film, several ordinary people witnessed the motherland!"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"I was deeply disappointed.This is another propaganda movie like ""Amazing China"".The only difference is that they hired a very good film director.Chinese Communist Party may have invested more money, but they still try to promote authoritarian Dictatorship with Chinese Characteristics the Chinese way."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Sadly, every Asian person in the screening I was in applauded at the end of the movie so the brainwashing is long-lasting.I wonder if the directors were coerced into making these short films by the ""party"" with the threat of re-education camp.It was just utterly unrealistic to portray Chinese people as ecstatic when the communist took over the country. I'd guess at most they had no ideas what was going on. How they show all the people in Hong Kong tearing up when it was returned to China was just such a blatant lie considering what's going on in HK right now (10/2019)."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"The crying shame here is that China has so many achievements, it doesn't need to resort to brainwashing propaganda style of movies decades ago. For example, the directors could have portrayed historic events in engaging fashion like the Crown or Chernobyl. I watched ""A bite of China"" before and loved it. It reflected the culture, the diversity, the way of life and how history shaped their cuisine. This is the direction forward, not this rubbish emotional propaganda they're trying to brainwash people with. China has more than enough to be proud of and how they overcame huge obstacles through reforms - and are today one of the world's largest economies and their population enjoying technological advancement and prosperity. The directors need to go back to the drawing board."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"A well done film with a distinct slice of life, unsung heroes theme. Each piece is more of a glimpse into people who lived throughout various momentous periods in Chinese history, rather than especially focused around plot development. A little bit heavy handed with the patriotism theme, but that's to be expected considering the movie's purpose. Although in my opinion there were two standout stories, all seven pieces were interesting and distinct enough that time didn't drag on."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"I live in China and it brought a lump to my throat at the end of the film. I watched it on CCTV-6 on New Years Day... so, that's as good as day as any to watch it.I am not Chinese though I live and work here. So I understand the premise of the film and the reasons why it was filmed the way it was - you now have three or sometimes four generations of Chinese families who have different experiences and perspectives of what living in China and being Chinese is all about - even within the same family - grandparents and even the parents have experienced great poverty and hardship which is something the Chinese youth of today haven't experienced to the same the degree.So, you have to realise that this is a factor when trying to make a film where the whole audience can relate. I enjoyed it a lot and just an observation from an outsider in their country and about who runs them and the way they're run - the vast majority of people like the way they're run and who's running them - which is why this film broke box office records.It is a love letter to the ordinary people of China because it is they who have made this country great. It is their turn to change the world and I salute them! Great film!"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"I think it is a fantastic work ,all the people who lived in China knows that it is not easy during these years.Chinese people have a lighting future, come on ,go ahead."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Obviously, This movie is the political brainwashing of the Chinese Communist Party for people."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"This is a movie made by and made for Chinese people. If you are not, but you are curious about what happened to China and the Chinese people during the past 70 years, I highly recommend you to watch it. But still, this is made for Chiese and if you don't feel anything speicla about it, that's because you don't understand, so please don't make yourself sound stupid by simply saying that this is not a good movie.Besides, i can understand why this movie may make somebody feel uncomfortable, as you don't want to acknowledge what China has devloped into during the past 70 years. You may still want to sit in the belcony at your own bedrrom and imigine how great your life is, but if you want to open your eyes, and discover the truth of China and of the world, go watch the movie."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,It is just a great movie for Chinese audiences. People held typical stereotype against communist party or Chinese people would never understand it. The first two stories are inspiring and touching. Stories in Beijing and Shanghai are also fun to watch. Ge You delivered high quality performance as usual with so much fun. Hong Kong piece is hard to act but not bad. I would rather give it a 9 score for this movie but Kaige Chen showed his father love to his son Feiyu Chen which made some scenes and performance awkward.
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"I love this movie. I would give it a 9 star. 8 for the movie itself and 1 for my personal experience.This movie is nothing as I expected. I thought it would focus more on country but it is not. Just as the name says, MY PEOPLE MY COUNTRY. People comes before Country.I like how the film describes each story from an individual person's perspective and how those milestone occurred in China's growing process affect her people.You don't have to be an soldier or a scientist to contribute. There are lots you can do as an ordinary person. This film shows love between friends, families, partners and all different types of love build up to the love of the land, the country and the people."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"This is a great patriotic movie. It reflects the difficult development process of a big country from several aspects, which makes people moved and admired. Although it's flawed from the perspective of movie narration, his theme makes me hot. I like this movie"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"The film takes the form of several short stories, all based around the theme of serving their nation of the PRC.Certain stories are excellent and potary a positive message, specifically the flag rasing story and the taxi driver story. The taxi driver story was a standout section, as it provided both quality humor and the positive message of charity.Some sections where simply not coherent or meaningful, such as the space story and the final story about the pilot. No real message and by this point in its very long run time I was bored.The remaining two stories both contained the frankly disturing message that loyalty to country is more important than the love between people. The scientist story was incoherent and distrubing, however the ping pong child story, although entertaining, also contained this disturing message of choosing patriotism above all else.The hongkong section was ok but the ""british"" delegates where acted by non brits, with one sounding austrailian and another had a german accent, which sticks out like a sore thumb to any english speakers watching.In all the movie was entertaining if not a little long, well made and well acted. The message of the movie changed rapidly from charming to dystopian."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"In the past, the same kind movie in China was just boring. Nowadays, it's a good movie beyond politics elements. Worth watching! I enjoy the whole procedures. The movie dig the details of big events of PRC, focus on the ordinary people of the long history land. I feel the breathe of people truly lived, truly work hard to build a new fantasy world. Obviously Chinese dream is different from American dream, but more attractive, more hopeful."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,This is a great movie ever!! It's the first time I heard people applaud two times after the movie and don't want to leave until eveything has finished. Such a great movie.
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"It's very surprised China has a such amazing quality film now, the screen scenes are very beautiful, and 2 of the stories are quite touching. However, still too much political elements in the film, I believe celebration stories could have more than one theme."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"This movie is full of China government's propaganda, I strongly recommend that you don't wasting time in such rubbish movie."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Art is supposed to be a tool to deliver emotional message, apparently this movie conducted it's purpose well. Movie like this apparently aim for viewers who share Chinese nationalism and adequate understanding on Chinese history, and consequently praise the achievement of CCP. Now for a movie that serves evident political purpose, it's done brilliantly. Glorifying instead of rewriting history, praising instead of preaching individual sacrifice, but unfortunately overwhelming the audience with deliberate focus on inciting emotion. Still, it's inherently way better than cheap propagandas or arrogant chauvinist films. If American Snipers is a 7, My country my people is at least 8."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Seems to be a good collection of stories based on historic events of modern Chinese history. The film quality is pretty good, as with the acting, if not a little over dramatized to get it's point across.Since I haven't seen a list of the short stories, they are as follows:The raising of the first Chinese flag on it's first day of independence day celebration.The development of Chinese nuclear programThe return of Hong Kong to ChinaSomething about ping pong2008 Beijing Olympics90th anniversary of Victory day celebrationReturn of two astronauts that spent 32~ days in space.The commonality on all these stories seem to prop up how great China is, and it's done so though personal sacrifice of it's people. People that seem singular minded in nationalism and putting that above all else. You can also see from the above list is that it is rather cherry picked events designed to showcase the best parts of themselves, perhaps even disguising all there low points in history.To me, it seems like a decent vehicle of propaganda within their borders, and foreigners. I have no doubts it was designed explicitly for that, so keep that in mind while watching."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"Good, however not great. This film is sort of Chinese communism propaganda. It told the story of the Chinese people, but just some stories."
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"The movie is a total trash because the plots are just bad(best of all is Hello, Beijing and The Eve, others are...) The plots don't seem to link to one another(maybe due to the bad cutscene?), a real flaw appears in many Chinese movies.Are Chinese directors and writers so bad at logic?"
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,It's a bad movie cause the stories are not well developed and the actors are so so.
我和我的祖国,"My People, My Country (2019)",,2019,2019.10.01,"This film was born a tribute film for 70 anniversary. Hence, there should have no extra requirement to force it facing diversified audiences. Brain washing? Sorry, these were all historical events and most Chinese already knew before the film. There was no other needs to do so. For Chinese, this is a quite good opportunity to recall, to support each other.As a Chinese, I know how unlucky my mother nation was I the past. Therefore, I will especially cherish what we gain today and struggle to protect it. Maybe you cannot understand, but this is our way to collaborate and to against the challenges.Everytime when I feel upset, feel helpless and want to give up. This movie can help me to remind how brave and persistent our predecessors were. And there will have no reason for us to give up or to be lazy."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"We often hear about how students in China are among the most hard-working in the world, real go-getters. The underbelly of this is the severe stress under which they operate. Derek Tsang's Academy Award-nominated ""Shaonian de ni"" (""Better Days"" in English). The protagonist is a bullied girl about to take the National College Entrance Exam. She hooks up with a local hoodlum, but surprises remain in store.The torment from the bullying reflects the pressure from the exam. It's a truly tough world for this girl as various events conspire to close the walls in on her. The complex characters and the general intensity of the plot make this one movie that you have to see. It's the first of Tsang's movies that I've seen, but I certainly hope to see more of them. A real masterpiece."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"It will lead u thinking the flaw of education system we have.Director darely zoom in actor facial almost 3/4 of the screento drew u inside the emotion. The interrogation scene will so perfectly edit,cut and switch between the two lead actors Some of the scene where two actor will just looking each other without saying any word and u already feel how much tough time they went through..its slowly put the spicy ingredients without your notice in beginning and burst into tears and deep thoughts in the end of the movie .its definitely the best Chinese movie of the year."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Bullying ~ the big menace in school. How it affects the bullied person mentally, emotionally, physically. The role of parenting. Not only giving birth but also becoming the parent. The school, teachers, parents, law, and above all we people; have to stop it. The story telling is good. The sacrifice we make, for the other persons.. Important message given which we dont think is a big issue. We take certain issues less important but actually being much more important.Questions raised on loyality, friends, bullying, parenting and much more. See for the message!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Every June, almost 10 million Chinese students sit for the National College Entrance Examination, or the ""Gaokao"". For many, this nine-hour exam is considered the most important deciding factor in a student's future: Success on the Gaokao is what determines acceptance to China's universities, which in turn determines one's future career.Although Better Days was initially censored by the Chinese government, the decision was later changed and the movie began showing in theaters. It's not hard to see why it enticed controversy in the first place as it portrays the Gaokao as a high pressure environment that fosters bullying, mental illness, and suicide. It opens a window to a world where students study endless hours in cram schools for their chance at a good future. Accountability in bullying cases is a recurring theme that underlies the movie.But don't get this wrong, this isn't a story about the Gaokao. This is a story about heartbreak. Heartbreak for students who are bullied by their peers. Heartbreak for single parents who put their hopes and dreams on their children. Heartbreak for those who love unconditionally and are willing to sacrifice everything. Dongyu Zhou (Soul Mate, Under the Hawthorn Tree) and Jackson Yee (TFboys) are deft as two halves of a love story while Director Derek Tsang masterfully captures the sheer range of both leads. The cinematography doesn't go unnoticed either as every shot has tremendous depth for those paying close attention.Of the many lines that stand out in this movie, one that resonates particularly is ""If you weren't the bully, then you were being bullied."" To me, this is what makes the film so powerful: its ability to pull at your heart over and over again. Go out and see this film. When you leave the theater, reflect on what you saw. Wonder how despite how far we have come, we still have so much left to go."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Young runaway thug meets little bullied student. Now, you may be thinking: cliche, cliche, cliche. Well, it may look that way, at first sight. But, matter of fact, the end result is - on the other hand, and by all means - utterly surprising and especially convincing.Never trite, never simplistic, never needlessly tear-jerking, never rhetorical (with the sole exception of the finale, but we'll get there...). An almost-masterpiece of social conscious drama.Even though - you know, because of the all-encompassing censorship - the movie has to proceed by ""suggesting"" and ""implying"", it still manages to convey an interesting point, in a manner which is never - I repeat, never - dull or silly.The movie manages to picture a complex everyday reality for an ever-to-large number of students, to picture an oppressing and uncompromising environment, full of every kind of pressure: scholastic, familiar, societal...Competition at all costs and unrestrained pursue of academic excellence are matched by a society which generally entails full-blown individual oppression. In such a context, there's little room left for hope and little hope left in the possibility of changing things for the better.Edge-of-your-seat gripping and memorable, ""Better Days"" crawls you in to never let you go, and as I said it compels you to see and investigate, and not ignore (which is always too easy to do).You will see with your own eyes what it means to grow up in a strictly hierarchical society, where you are from a very young age ""put into the right pace"" and ""educated"" to the most complete abnegation and the most fatalistic acceptance.Compelled to always be on-the-top-of-your-game, compelled to never fail, never slow down. Because failing is not an option, failing just one test may complete ruin your future existence. Of course, there's consequentially no time for compassion, no time for any kind of distraction, no time to really socialize (and empathize), no time to play, no time to fool around. You must be always perfect. Perfect. Again: at all costs.I mean, the unbearable pressure which Asian's students have always be subjected to reaches almost paroxysmal levels (for another example of this state of things, I'd strongly suggest you also give a chance to the chilling Korean movie ""Pluto"", 2012).By suggesting and implying ""Better Days"" seems to have been able to elude censorship to some degree. Yes, the finale is clearly false: the last ten minutes or so have most probably been added because of censorship. But - almost incredibly - this finale doesn't really ruin the good work done in the two hours plus before it. Because it's very critical and very hard-hitting, and not by any chance consolatory or reassuring or uplifting, with all due respect to the propaganda agency.So, in the end, to sum it all up I would say that the movie doesn't make any new point and doesn't really cover any new ground, but it's able to face its topical subject matter with assurance and ability, and great technical gift, as made clear by the excellent directing, the dark gloomy cinematography and great acting (the two protagonists really have a unique chemistry).""Better Days"" is a great movie. Realistic, poignant and thought-provoking. A little gem. Don't miss it."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"So sad, so beautiful, so real, the scenes of Chen Nian and Xiao Bei are cute, poetic and sensitive, warm our hearts, in contrast, the Bullying scenes hurt in the soul... But a divine film nominated for Oscar and very necessary, undoubtedly in the dispute with Druk and Colectiv (who deserves more in the documentary category) this leads ... Exciting outcome, wonderful unfolding, lyrical scenes, Dongyu Zhou deserved a little Oscar nomination... Wonderful..."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Tsang is no question a force to be reckoned him. Without him the film is perhaps at best a 5/10, as the script and story is forgettable and predictable. The director is able to instil a sense of modernism and style into the film. Better Days is also helped out by having a strong performance from both of the leads. Regardless, the motif and theme of the movie has to be told one way or another, bullying is perhaps an often forgotten topic in Chinese society, and one that is not always recognized in a country where everything is developing at such a lightning pace. More of these films should and needs to be made, works like this raises awareness but most importantly really looks at the human side & reasoning behind bullying."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I was unable to take my eyes off of the screen for the entire movie. A girl is preparing to take her entrance exams in order to enter Beijing University. The competition is fierce and after the suicide of a fellow student, she is bullied by a few extremely vicious classmates. A street thug crosses paths with her and winds up protecting her from her tormentors. A plot twist involving her foes turns this into a top tier crime drama. The two leads are tremendous and by the end of the film I was emotionally drained. This is an example of what movie is meant to be. It should have won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Derek Tsang's Oscar Nominated (Best International Film) is an impassioned look at school bullying. The movie can be unsparing in depiction of the maltreatment, and, at times it seems like life for our teenage heroine Chen Nian (Dongyu Zhou) is nothing but abuse, whether it be physical or psychological. Still, Tsang brings to it a style and a sweep that is emotionally satisfying all the while.Chen is a smart high school student on the verge of taking the national college entrance boards - think SAT but done on a Super Bowl level*. The pressures are enormous enough without having a nasty gang of Heathers using all kinds of tactics to make her life miserable. Chen strikes up an unlikely relationship with a street hustler named Xiao Bei (Jackson Yee) and he agrees to be her personal bodyguard of sorts.The scenes with Chen and Xiao give Tsang an opportunity to really show off his visual skills, even if some of it seems cribbed from Wong Kar-Wai (he is hardly the first, of course, look no further than Sofia Coppola). Varqa Beuher's electronic score adds to the propulsive mix. Tsang also employs time jumps and a lot of cross-cutting - not always to the movie's advantage. A third act twist somewhat derails the story into legal thriller territory. Still, there is no denying Tsang's prowess even at its most overwrought. Zhou is in her late 20s, but, her waif-like appearance easily convinces that she is 17, and her performance is extremely affecting. HK teen idol Yee has a good screen presence to add to their screen chemistry.BETTER DAYS tells a universal story about bullying, but, it has a vision of its own. Tough subject matter, but, a very rewarding one.* There has been some internet controversy about Jiu Yuexi's source novel that the movie is based on being unduly influenced by a similar Japanese book by author Higashino Keigo. Of course, in Japan, the national exams are perhaps the most famously hellish in the world."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This movie was touted as a must-see, especially for couples, with its theme of school violence that is quite brave for China, and I have to admit, for a while it managed to keep me interested. The suicide of a schoolgirl, the main character suffering from her peers' violence, with only one mysterious person out there to support her - how could that not be moving? Is it that the Chinese movie industry has finally come to age and movies on difficult topics are now being made?However, it is a Chinese movie, and no matter how brave they dare to be, there is a set of rules that they have to follow. Bad guys have to be in prison, policemen and women cannot be corrupt even slightly (lest justice will be served as always), and so on. For this reason, the emotional conflict and hard decisions of the main characters are completely spoiled when they decide to admit what they have done and surrender after talking to a policeman once, and the final accord is one of the lead actors telling us about how we should be vigilant about school violence, and about oh so many things the government does to prevent it; instead of leaving some food for thought to the viewers, the film decides to spoon-feed, and that does ruin the impression quite a bit.You will probably not see this movie outside of China, and its cinema run is coming to an end now, but if you do, try to appreciate the fact that this movie is doing something new for the ever more conservative modern Chinese cinema at this difficult time. There are some bits and pieces that might make you feel something, and some of the shots are really beautifully made."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The design of the opening female student jumping off the building has reminded the original team 's ambition: first to isolate the external sounds through English listening, and then to transmit information only through vision. When Chen Nian went downstairs to view that section, it was a standard thriller scheduling mode. The switch between overhead and down shots deepened the confrontation between individuals and groups, the metaphor of the relationship between characters and buildings, and the rapid switching of chat messages Nero's WeChat avatar), a close-up of the face enlarged through the media of the mobile phone, the photo flashed in front of our eyes, and at this time, the title of ""Youth of the Youth"" appeared. It can be said that this is the opening of the most powerful movie I have seen in the cinema this year.Apart from the facial close-up technique I mentioned at the beginning, the relationship between the film and the architectural space is also worth mentioning. At this point, Zeng Guoxiang fully exposed the characteristics of HK's origin (I suspect that the reason for framing Chongqing is also the same, the urban architectural styles of the two places are too similar), those inter-city buildings, closed teaching buildings, vertically extending steps, depth of field In contrast to the viaduct, these architectural elements together create a repressive emotional atmosphere in the film, which also largely implies the common situation of Chen Nian and Xiao Bei in this society. The lighting reinforces the use of such elements again: the neon light of Chen Nian and Xiao Bei playing with each other, the cold light close-up of red ink on the seat, the spatial light effect of the depth of field, and the flow of soft light on the final escort vehicle. Perhaps this year's best light treatment in the Chinese film industry.The argument will pass, and the image will be eternal."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Watched this file in China. Love this film, especially touched by major actor and actress. There are so many scenes that are really touched and impressed, like when the Nian and Bei in the trial room and they looked at each other without saying any word, but I cried heavily by just looking at their eyes and their facial expressions. The music and photography in this movie are also very nice. The critical theme I read from this movie is to prevent young kids from campus violence, which is still very common anywhere. Maybe not everyone like Nian can be protected and loved by someone like Bei, but I hope there is no more campus violence and everyone who had experienced or is experiencing campus violence can still have the hope of better days, and everyone who witness the campus violence can standup and stop the violence bravely. I think I'll take my friends to watch the movie again when the movie is released in US."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,This movie had me bawling. All the actors nailed their performance especially the two protagonist. They had a beautiful chemistry. Their love was pure and deep. It definitely is one of the best 2019 movie. Our times is my all time favourite asian coming of age movie. And this just became my second favourite.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Why does school violence happen? What is the reason why one person is bullied by another? Is it just two people who have different ideas, or one person who is disliked by the other person who is bullied?Bullies are a bit like demons, and at that moment all the pity and compassion is gone from them.A little bit like bullying is a little bit of isolation and ridicule. At such a sensitive age in youth, not fitting in with a group can feel like a loss and can affect every aspect of life.Dealing with others is inevitable throughout life, and building a supportive environment is something everyone needs to think about and learn from.I also thought about how to get along with people better after some friction with people around me. But now looking back on that time, or feel lost, as if a piece of cake was bitten off a gap, but perhaps regret is also a kind of life.Hope everyone is treated well!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The story is heartbreaking! Plus the acting of two main characters are extremely amazing! Not to mention Zhou Dongyu, 27-year-old acting as 18-year-old ChenNian, not presented by a big yelling, only by the drops of heartbreaking tears. She is such a talented actress. Her performance evoked everyone's emotions and totally expressed her fear and hatred. Another scene about Xiaobei shaving her head which is so true and touchable!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Nominated for best foreign language movie , I was curious to watch as the synopsis sounded interesting.The story is set in the class sitting their final exam of a college in order to move to university.Bullying takes a terrible toll and one girl who comes from humble roots is caught up in a series of threats from the bulliesHer path crosses a hardened criminal and an unlikely alliance is formed.A wonderfully written script and direction that give scenes with little dialogue deep resonance and emotion.Very moving movie which highlights the subject of bullying and those that carry it out and those that observe but do nothing.Highly recommended."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"For watching the whole movie, if there is no idea about the various illegal acts, let me say: It is definitely a very dangerous thing. But when you see illegal activities and think about what to do, you can make people like the protagonists have a better life, build laws that protect them, and find ways to make them grow and live healthily and healthily. I feel that it is a major focus of the whole movie."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"See, the Academy Awards are good for something. If it wasn't for them, I don't know that I would have found this terrific movie, which was nominated for Best International Feature Film along with four other extremely good movies that all lost, ridiculously, to ""Another Round.""""Better Days"" explores the extreme bully culture that exists in a Hong Kong high school which, combined with the rigorous academic pressure, causes a student to commit suicide as the movie opens. From there, it follows the story of another young woman who feels compunction about doing nothing to help the bullied student and becomes a target of bullies herself. She falls in with a tough and troubled young man who becomes a kind of bodyguard, and the two strike up a romance.I had two reactions to ""Better Days."" The first was: Sheesh, is this really what being an adolescent in Hong Kong is like and how awful if it is. The second was: What an incredibly romantic movie. End titles reveal that the film was based on actual events. How liberally it adapted those events I don't know. But what we get is a lush, blissed out romance that had me aching for the two protagonists to be together at the end, and a lot of worrying along the way that they wouldn't be.Grade: A."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Greetings again from the darkness. Chinese gaokao is the College Entrance Exams that determine the future of high school students and their families. The pressure is extreme for the kids, and when the film opens, the exams are only 60 days away. One of the students leaps to her death from an upper breezeway to the concrete courtyard below. Her fellow classmates converge on the scene with cell phones recording the tragedy. One girl, Chen Nian, quietly covers up the body. While most assume the pressure of the impending test was too severe for the girl, Nian knows better. The relentless bullies that motivated the suicide have now turned their attention to Nian.Director Derek Tsang (aka Kwok Cheung Tsang) delivers a beautiful film with compelling characters and a heart-wrenching story. Jiuyue Xi's novel, In His Youth, In Her Beauty"" has been adapted for the screen by co-writers Wing-Sum Lam, Yuan Li, Yimeng Xu, and Nan Chen. Filmed in 2018, the Chinese government delayed its release due to concerns over how its society would be perceived, given extreme bullying, class differences, and the extensive use security cameras throughout. Instead, we note the similarities in people, and how young people carry burdens that often go unacknowledged.Zhou Dongyu gives a terrific performance as Chen Nian. She's an excellent, devoted student who has no one to depend on thanks to a mostly absentee mother who spends her time scamming for money and dodging creditors. Nian has no real friends, and her closest companion was the one whose body lay crumpled in the courtyard. Nian stumbles into a situation that could not be described as a 'meet-cute', and soon she has requested street punk Xiao Bei (played by Jackson Yee) to act as her protector against the bullies, so that she may focus on the exams. Additionally, she's been questioned by the police in regards to the suicide, and Detective Zhang (Yin Fang) takes a particular interest given his knowledge of schoolyard bullies.The bond between equally adrift and confused teenagers Nian and Bei grows, despite his being a dropout. Are they star-crossed lovers? Is it a budding romance? What makes it interesting is that it doesn't even matter. What does matter is the courage these two youngsters show in the face of adversity. Does it go too far? The third act will leave you wondering just what is the answer to their dilemma. How harshly can you judge those in self-preservation mode when the school motto is ""Work Hard. No Regrets""? There is a retro feel to Tsang's filmmaking style, and we are left with the reminder that ""used to be"" infers a sense of loss ... and we all experience different types of loss. Excellent filmmaking that rightly earned an Oscar nomination."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"""If this is how the world works, would you bring a child into it?""Powerful story of bullying, friendship, sacrifice, and the crucible Chinese kids go through in trying to get into the best universities, urged on by the platitudes of adults, so that they can have a better life. Zhou Dongyu and Jackson Yee turn in soulful performances as kids who are vulnerable in different ways, and Zhou Ye is perfectly evil as the main bully. Even with someone looking out for you, who will protect the protector? The film probably goes on a tad too long, but the way parts of the story are revealed and the emotions it plays on keep it riveting throughout."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I watch a lot of movies from all genres, and this one was one of the most intelligent, informative, and moving scripts I've seen. Hong Kong produced (perhaps prior to Beijing CCP repression) it tells a story out of Chongqing of high school students preparing for the Gaokao, the National College Entrance Examination.We focus is on a studious, timid girl being bullied, and in educational opposition, her rescuer, a poorly educated street hood. Subplot of suicide driven by both bullying & the pressure to succeed to the best universities. Who is responsible for stopping bullying? The parent(s); the teachers; the school?Another subplot is how the students are politically regimented by an authoritarian government."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,A film about youth I haven't seen before. The male character's acting so cool.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I was given the chance to sit down and watch ""Better Days"" (aka ""Shao nian de ni"") here in 2020, and of course I jumped at the chance as this was an Asian movie that I hadn't already seen.I didn't know anything about the movie when I sat down to watch it, so I didn't have any expectations to it either. Which was good, because director Derek Tsang definitely didn't fail to impress.This movie was pretty hard-hitting, director Derek Tsang seemed to know what buttons to push for optimal effect. And I will say that the movie can actually turn out to be difficult for some viewers to watch.The storyline was good, and it was driven by something of a mixture of an interesting script and storyline, along with some really impressive acting performances. I was especially impressed with the performance of Dongyu Zhou - in the lead role as Chen Nian - as she really carried the movie phenomenally. Her performance really blew me away, and made it so well-worth watching the movie.The movie deals with bullying, a subject that can be somewhat delicate for some viewers. But I think that director Derek Tsang managed to present the movie in a convincing and realistic manner. Well, at least I was genuinely entertained by what transpired up to the end of the movie, where the story sort of fell apart for me. I didn't like the ending one bit, nor the sudden and abrupt turn of direction that the story took. But hey, to each their own.""Better Days"" is a movie that flew under my radar, but it is a movie that you most definitely should take the time to sit down and watch, if you are given the chance. I am rating it six out of ten stars."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,I love the script and the performance. The play is so touching. We cried a lot.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Overall not bad. Directing, camera, music, acting are all good. Criticism: too many crying, and bad ending. It has to end this way otherwise it will not pass Chinese government censorship."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Debating on where I should start this review I finally came to the conclusion that it should be said from the start that even though this film is set in China and the language is chinese, the experiences of the characters are truely universal to people all over the world (Bullying, lose, self sacrifice) and this film through it's narrative explores these concepts in a way that was so powerful and engaging, I'm still thinking about it over a week later after first seeing the movie. Its very easy in Tv and Cinema to make show these themes in a very cliche manner and make them seem almost distant, unremarkable and unrelatable. This isn't the case with Better Days. It narrative and cinematography captures the viewer to show the harsh reality of a story of girl undergoing the fiendishly difficuly gaokao test (The chinese entrence exam) and how she tries to find herself through the emotional maze and balancing acts of staying strong enough not to sink and give up. Not to get anything of the story away apart from saying we can learn a lot about human nature in the film the good sides and the bad. If you're a fan of international movies watch it, If you're a fan of character growth and developent, again watch it. If you're interested in action, high paced drama. Perhaps this isn't the film for you."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This film made me want to watch Falling Angels, but I'm not sure if that was the initial goal.A story about bullying, which transforms into a Romeo and Juliet-like love story that takes your attention and smashes it onto the screen. With it's capturing story about a young student and a small-time punk, discovering eachother at their worst and blossoming to their best before hitting rock bottom again, it really has the essence of a true modern love poem written by the likes of Leonard Cohen. It will make you cry, even if you are the most heartless person in the world, and it will shake your perception of two people falling for eachother.Have you ever thought of going to prison for the person most important to you, sacrificing your whole life for them? Well. Xiao Bei did, and he did it with no remorse. Remorse comes as a consequence to actions, whether they're well or ill-intentioned.The cinematography of this movie is bliss, with the editing giving a great view on the emotion and world that is teenage Chongqing.By far my favorite for the Best International Feature, which is sadly it's only nomination.10/10"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"It moved us deeply because the performance of the character is elegant.When you watch this movie, you can think of something with the characters and think about yourself."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Note: Spoilers at the bottom - rest should be spoiler free.In short:If you like drama's that are emotional, with leads acing their parts and small reasonable twists holding the interest up - this is for you. This is a ""slow"" movie and if you do not appriciate extraordinary performances mixed with beautiful cinematography and really good editing - then stay away.In longer:The cinematography is at parts beautiful without forcing in outside shots, it's used to strengthen the emotional view of the movie and it's done so in a great way. There are also smaller scenes as when plot is edited together from previously in the movie to illustrate the thought of the character paired with camera effects to bring out emotion in completely mundane scenes that means the emotional scenes are built up with a solid foundation. This is a masterpiece. There is really one part i have a problem with and that is probably what was changed for it to be ok'd by the Chinese after first being censored.Pro'sChemistry between leads and their outstanding performancesCinematography (editing, music, camerawork)Clear notion about the underlying themeCon'sPossible plagiarism - if the other posters are rightThe endingPossibly that more play with light could have been used to effect or as effectSPOILERS BELOWThe ending is senseless, everything is still fine even though she cried - unless you're to take the adult comment literally the pattern of action were still on track.Which made the journey after completely out of place. And also derailing that ending that was built up throughout the story. Yes it makes it slightly more realistic, but it also removes it from being a strong 9/10 movie. This is one movie where a different movie ending could have been liberating and extremely climactical without being easy to forsee. I can't say this ending ruins the movie but it does detract 1 star.SPOILERS ABOVE"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Better Days, is Hong Kong's official entry to the Oscars and it was shortlisted. It's a great powerful movie. The story is so beautiful and tackles a really important topic and a serious problem that all societies are facing; bullying. It is also so beautifully written; the screenplay is brilliant, rich and keeps you involved all the time. It's very well acted and directed as well. Although Better Days is so sad and hard to see, it's a must watch movie. It's important, enjoyable, and very well mare."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This movie was hard to watch. Incredibly sad to see what some people go through. Though it is quite dark & harrowing to watch, it may be a good idea to be shown in all high schools."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Except for the scenario of the script, which seems to be familiar, the quality of the others is really good. Whether it is cold violence or direct violence, various small details reflect the psychological and physiological process of the current campus violence. The portrayal of each major character is lively. The director knows the current situation of the violence in Chinese campus classes very well. In place. If the script is more creative at the end, and the movie is more flexible, it is a masterpiece. It is worth mentioning that in my mind Yi Qian Qianxi has completely faded my first impression of dislike of tfboys, and the acting skills are better than the 12 hours of Changan. After reading my mind, I was grateful to the alma mater of the middle school. The gratitude era and the affiliated middle school did not let me experience the unbearable learning environment of campus violence. Most of my classmates were kind and humble, and my teachers were Amiable. I hope that every child can protect himself with the juvenile method. When he ca n't look up to the starry sky in the abyss and is helpless, picking up a butcher may be a helpless choice."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,China has come out with a well deserved International Film Oscar contender. The film explores bullying at a number of angles from school to authorities to national. It is crafted very well giving you enough image and atmosphere to make you know whose side you are comfortable to be on.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"As person who knew what it felt to be left alone in school i think thi is the first film that captures very well that feeling.To be honest i didn´t like the ending, it just didn´t seem real , i liked the idea of him protecting her but the ending was umm fictional, in my opinion, but everyone should watch this.To those who are the populars in school F´´K OFF."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"It's a good one but it might be better if they focused more on the bullying issue and it's underlying causes, the romance is okay but not quite necessary"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The movie is rearranged from a novel which the whole story get ideas from two of the books written by KeigoHigashino (A really awesome Japanese writer, Google him!)There were evidence, however, the producer paid WeiBo to delete the evidence that was posted three years ago and WeiBo explained that because it is illegal, the information is not allowed to show you. The director knew it is not an original work, he still chose to bought the book and rearranged it.The evidence is in Chinese and some people saved it from Internet before it was deleted. However, because of the language, it is hard tk explain in English.Besides that, some frames are criticized as plagiarism too. The logic is unreasonable in Chinese society. And some special frames can be found in another movie. And no other movie have the same frames.The male main actor has so many fans in China. They support the movie and regard this as a fantastic work.Moreover, the movie seems talking about the violence in school. However, the main point is actually romantic story. The movie does not focus on the real school violence in China and does not tell the reasons, the solutions or suggestions to people. The male character fight with others to save him and the female character.The movie use the topic school violence as a tool to attract people who didn't know the plagiarism truth and use it as a cover to get support from society."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Anyone that is familiar with the Japanese author Keigo Higashino, and his novel Journey under the midnight sun should find this film eerily familiar, that is because the novel that this film was adapted from is a blatant act of piracy. Everything from it's plot to character development and even some dialogue were a lifted from Journey under the midnight sun and I think it's quite vital that everyone knows this."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,The storyline and meaning behind is good. Bullying is the clear message of this movie. It's a drama but too dramatic to make the story that way. The bullying exist but in that way..... little over. It's not bad to watch though and should make more aware of bullying.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Can you believe it and could you believe that Chinese high school students before graduation still got to recite the textbook loudly all together in the class? They don't seem to have independent thinking, all of them are molded and formatted into the same uniformity. They just try to memorize all the details of their mountainous textbooks to pass the college entry exams. What a ridiculous Chinese education!Did anybody notice that the crash landing location of that suicide student was way too far away from the building? Yes, she jumped but she's just stepped out and dropped down, not like Olympic high diving competition, it's not possible that she would landed almost in the center of the courtyard so far away the building. It's not logical at all."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"With the debut of Yee on cinema, this film is generally a nice attempt for Chinese films based on school-bullying theme. While the original novel from which this film recomposed is suffering from deputes, saying it has plagiarised both the Japanese original novel and the cover of CMBYN."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,A school girl get bullying by her girl schoolmates badly and she seek help of a small goon guy..then one of the girl who were bullied team killed by someone..Nice love story with thriller plot..Good acting by hero and heroin....Must watchable movie...!!
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The acting is superb, the pacing is one spot, the story is beautifull. Damn this movie was amazing.I guess bullying needed a powerfully movie like this.Shut up I'm not crying your crying"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The film is based on a novel that borrows from three of Mr. Higashino's books, and it mixes the plots of all three. The film's director studied Chinese law carefully and changed the plot of the novel so that we knew it was copied but could do nothing about it.We think this is a very shameless behavior, which seriously harms the interests of the original author.We are very supportive of Keigo Higashino to stand up for himself.And I hope Jackson Yee's fans don't come here to get rave reviews!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I wish I can give 100000/100 for this movie. The story so real, and actress and actors player did a fantastic job in the movie."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,""" BETTER DAYS also strives on the crest of Zhou Dongyu and Jackson Yee's massive star appeal. The former has again proved that she is worth her salt as one of the most prominent actresses in today's Chinese cinema, and here, coupled with Yee, who is 8 years her junior, she betrays no signs of the age difference, and interprets a high school girl's vulnerability, understanding and strength to a fare-thee-well. As for the heartthrob Yee, the youngest member of the beloved boyband TFBoys, barely 19 years old, who moves into acting with a big splash and really breaks his duck in his first leading role. He manifests an intensity that most young, swaggering teen idols do not possess, and that audience can feasibly relate to.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"As a senior high school student from China, I think no one would feel more touched than me. It tells you what a student would be like when facing the most important examination and difficulties of life at the same time. In China, millions of families expect the youths to change their life through the ""Gaokao"", so the students are not fighting for themselves, but for the whole family, which means a huge stress. If you come to the middle schools of China, especially those in relatively poor area, you could hardly avoid seeing something bad, such as violence, as you can see in this film."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This entire film belongs to the superbly and powerful performance of Dongyu Zhou. She makes her character so believable, sometimes fragile and innocent, sometimes strong and under control. I can't understand how Oscar ignores a performance like this. I guess we simply have to accept the fact that the Oscar award has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with films and is totally politically controlled. Very sad!!!!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I've watched this movie for three times. What should we do if our children have those problems? It's useless to rely on others to understand and sympathize, we really should do something to avoid bullying in schools!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Finally understood why Qianxi received so much recognition after acting in this movie. His gaze and the tense in-between silence. Wow. Zhou Dong Yu's acting skills are so good as many of her lines are spoken through facial expressions, which made it difficult.As I do not live in China, I have always thought that students in China studied tirelessly for the National College Entrance Examination in China. This movie simply reinforces my thought as I watch how pressured the students are and how 'big' this exam is in China. For example, there was even a mini opening session before the start of the exam in front of the school.This movie sheds light on the consequences of bullying-such as revenge which might be murder. Alongside is some interesting bittersweet romance between the male and female lead."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"An outstanding film worthy of Oscar status in every country! Its the best film I have ever seen that covers the dreaded age old problem of cowards bullying the weak or timid. It happens to both adults and children but, we hear of the affect it has upon schoolkids etc more so than anything else. Unlike what one reviewer has said, this is neither a forgettable or predictable film. You cannot forget the splendid performance of the bullied girl (played by Zhou). She gives an amazing outing of terror and fear and her pain is so real.The story is a true one that actually happened but sadly only the real life victim and her protector were the only ones punished. I personally don't think she should have been punished for the accident and, the bully very much received her just punishment. The other gutless cowardly scumbags who encouraged and supported her shaming got away with it...as is typically usual.The Chinese police were mild in their manner in this (which is not usually the case as they are as corrupt with their methods of obtaining confessions etc as the Japanese police are...and very likely many others around the world) but the police segments/scenes were the weak part of the film. That, for me, is due to the fact the interrogations were far too static, lacking and rushed.This should be made into a film by every country in the world - using each countries most loved actors, actresses etc - so that it can be viewed in schools.If you are being bullied you need to hurt your bully so bad they will do what all cowards do, BEG you to stop and then they RUN! Tell both your parents and police but don't expect help from your school. There are teachers who want to help the bullied but, the school heads and governors prefer to hush it up and cover it up! Its the same in Colleges, University's and work places. But don't give up! I didn't and I made my bullies pay for it dearly!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I don't like ELEPHANT(2003), but this movie is kind of the same homogeneous from the former. After watching this, felt like I've watch two movie. The first half is about bully in school, the second is like.....ah, about love or something, after all it is akward. Sitting in the cinema, I can't help stop thinking, why am I here watching this , why the director will make those lines so childish and navie? Wait, she did that thing?It's torture in the second hour. What's going on in the school, why bully happen, who take the responsibility of bully, the teacher or those adult who were watching ? What next?Yeah, next is the subtitles, said, China government will do something blablabla, full of platitudes."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Everything about this movie is great. From how it portrays the pressure of education in most Asian countries, to how much bullying can affect the lives of students, to how ignorant most people are regarding the mental abuse that bullying can cause... Every issue tackled was tackled with such brilliance.Apart from the writing, I feel that the actors in this movie deserve the most credit. Every character portrayal was done so well, and that played a huge role in the impact this movie had on me. Especially the portrayal by lead actress Dongyu Zhou as Chen Nien... it was a show-stealer. Another aspect of this movie I liked was how unlike most movies about school bullying, it never went over-the-top to prove a point. Everything was pretty grounded in how people (the bullies and the bullied) tend to react in real life scenarios as such.I also love the camerawork in this film; where so much emphasis was put on the close-up shots, that in turn, created a sort of intimacy between the audience and the characters on screen. This helped empathize with the characters a whole lot more. And even the urban landscapes were photographed well enough to show the concrete prison Chen Nien felt trapped in.Overall, this is a movie I really enjoyed. It's entertaining, emotional and educational at the same time. Would definitely recommend."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Chen nian a girl studying in high school, her life is harsh due bullying from her classmates, her friend committed suicide due to the same reason. After the bullying became pretty harsh she met a boy who was abandoned by his parents. They made contract, that boy will protect her from the bullies.This movie conveys an anti-bullying message.Technically the movie is very brilliant, editing is exceptionally amazing, all the montage scenes are well edited and there is a smooth transition in between the shots and scenes.The movie started as a crime thriller and ended as a romance drama. First ten minutes into the film it was so gripping and I thought it's going to be like this till the end. But everything went down the hill when Chen nian and that boy started romancing. It was still okay to watch the film but it became less engaging and I lost the grip. Even in these moments everything was technically perfect, it was fast-paced like what it was in the beginning, the editing was good(this is in the second half of the film) but the writer focused more on romance and drama instead of crime and thrill. Thus, I lost the kind of vibes of thrill which I had in the beginning. Anyway, I watched it till the end. It would have been much better if they cut many scenes which focused on romance.Give it a try. But personally, this movie failed to satisfy me in the way I wanted."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Good movie but too long... Need to edit. I would had rated an 8, but went with a 7."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This film does not desever the Oscar nominations 2021. It copys a lot of best details of 2 novels of Higashino Keigo: ""Journey Under a Midnight Su""n & ""The Devotion of Suspect X"". The Asian netizens have been debating fiercely on the plagiarism issue since it was shown in 2019. Thousands of people have read these novels agree with the impossible similarity without copyright. Please stop this thief and kick it out of Oscar nominations. Don't ruin Oscar's reputation."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Sappy, unrealistic, allegedly-plagiarized story about bullying."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,I have never cried so much when watching a film like this! The first 30min of the film really made me pre- assume how the story was going to go but NOPE. It took a completely different route! I showed my family the same day after i finished it and i have never seen them cry so much. In conclusion this is a REALLY good story and it will put you through an emotional rollercoaster.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"What a shame for those people call it is a masterpiece! How the actor call Jackson Yee is when he still decided to film this movie even though he know this movie is the Plagiarism from his favourite Authour. If you wanna be an actor, you must know how to be a decent human first, boy."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Stayed up until 1 AM for this. It was a very enraging and thought-provoking piece. Everything that I want in a film, I got from Better Days but I really need to highlight the outstanding performance and photography it exhibited. Such as masterclass! Will definitely share with more people as a reminder of humanity's worst and best asset."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Poor performance and it all count on his fans in China, pathetically"

少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Not only it conveys a great message, but it also does so in an engaging way.Both lead actors' performances were exceptional.Unfortunately, it would have been a better accomplishment if it was more subtle storywise."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,Disappointed when you expected more to be given under such a controversial social phenomenon.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I have to say this movie really pulled on my heartstrings. I usually don't watch Chinese movies because the ones I've seen are quite censored because of their government. However, this showed an incredible story about a strong but rare bond between two people. I loved the way this film was directed and shot, it felt so real. The actors delivered very strong and believable performances. Some scenes were incredibly moving but I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything. Some say they thought the last hour was disappointing. I completely disagree, I was hooked from the opening scene to the end credits. The depth of this story is really extraordinary. The bullying was extremely sad to see but I'm glad they showed the reality of it, it's not just hair-pulling and name calling, it can completely destroy a person. Glad they shed a light on what Asian students go through with the pressure of school. An absolutely beautiful, dark film. Definitely recommend!!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,These reviewers are idiots just when this country started making great movies. These people want to suppress the filmmakers. This is the one of the best crime-drama-romance movies I have seen. The lead actress did phenomenonal job in facial expressions and lead actor too. The story is pretty intense you can feel the exam pressure and emotions. There aren't many movies that can do that to me but this one does successfully. Ending is not too impressing but first and mid half of the story is beautiful. So it's a beautiful movie you must watch! 9/10.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"One of the wrong things that I did is reading some of the reviews here. The more I read, the more they started to clould my judgment about this film. And it's a good one. One of its qualities is that it tries to grapple with more than bullying and abuse among students in schools and show complexity of the roles people are made to take in this whole situation. Which works especially for the young ones. And that's not easy and not always succesful. Of course, I'm from the Europe, so some things here don't appeal to me or I might have few wrong notions about some details, but this one is another case which tells me that with every Asian film (no only Chinese) I get more and more fascinated how good they get. Of course, nothing is perfect even if it's good. Especially when this film is trying to say much more than it can take so the end doesn't look so good (it does work, eventually, but it could be even better). But all in all, it describes society fighthing for its normalcy (and trying to define it) and is doing it good."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"In the People's Republic of China, after being brainwashed, many people do not know how to be original. It is shameful not to know how to copy. This film copied a lot of content from Japanese movies. However, this film has made more Chinese young people see hope, that is, the campus problem. There is no singing of the government, a solid storytelling, this can be praised!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Melodramatic thriller revolving on the dark side of school bullying & the nerve frightening GaoKao exams.Accidentally came across this movie while browsing through IMDb. First few mins of the movie was too stressful just by the sight of students sweating day and night for GaoKao (National College Entrance Examination, NCEE) in which 10 million chinese students future education in University depends on the marks scored in this exam.The perseverance of Chen Nian despite all odds to get into university was portrayed effortlessly.Bullying, Suicide, Poverty, debt, abuse of power, helplessness at such critical point in life were beautifully presented. Background music was heavenly, especially in the prison & vehicle scene in climax.The sacrificial nature of protagonist reminds me of Vijay Sethupathi in Ka Ka Ka Ka Po."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Go to see this movie with my girlfriend. I have to say this is a terrible movie. It is totally made for young women who love watching pretty actors. It shows some students being bullied heavily and one hoody saved her. The city's safety is so poor that it makes me feel like there is no rule in the city. A bunch of people just bully the girl, ripping her cloth off and take videos and nobody finds that? Is china still the safest country in the world? If the scene described in the movie is true, then the chief police officer should be fired immediately. As far as I see, the scene is fake. Pls don't try to make a story for the story. This is not a fiction movie. The ending of the movie is good. But the whole story just unrealistic af."

少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,I love the way this film was directed i love the acting i love the script i love everything in this film.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,This movie So dark and every part from this movie make me cry you should watch this is deserved every seconds .
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This is deep, soulful and very emotional movie. I would say it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story is wonderful. Actors was on fire - they went so deep to their roles, that I was amazed of their acting. Movie's soundtrack improves atmosphere even better. Absolutely must watch movie. 10/10."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I have to admit I cried a lot so you might want to be prepared for that lol. It has a great meaning, and it touches on a big social issue. The chemistry between the 2 lead actors is amazing and you can feel such raw pain and realism just through their acting alone. I highly recommend this movie."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"It's a deal, you protect the world and I protect you -""Better Days"" is a punch in the gut, it's heavy, heartbreaking, violent and even gruesome at times. I loved everything about this movie, I'm very very critical over films and let me tell you that this one completely blew my mind.Though every single aspect of it is unforgettable, what makes the story beautiful is the leads, it's not that common for me to love the main characters (specially if they're a couple). But their chemistry is so mesmerizing that we don't even need a lot of dialog, they can express everything just by looking at each other.The photography was amazing. Seriously, the directors did an incredible job in making us feel every emotion shown to us. They always captured the right moments in a way that completely fit the style of the movie, the lighting (or lack of it), the angles, everything.I felt as if they filmed most scenes in such an intimate way that made me feel so close to the movie, as if it was something special and deep. As a result, we feel really close to it as if we're watching something personal, intimate.Because of all the things I wrote here and many more reasons I couldn't express it with words, I will never get over the fact that this didn't get the Oscar, it deserved so much more recognition.Well, emphasizing my headline, I'll ever forget the feeling of watching ""Better Days"" for the 1st time and I'm sure whoever watches it won't either."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"So touching so real so well played by the actors,amazing."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,For the order of the env not catch by other animals.It is a shame for HONG KONG cinema and chinese film history.7 screenwrite to contribute the shallow scripts.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"For watching the whole movie, if there is no idea about the various illegal acts, let me say It is definitely a very dangerous thing. But when you see illegal activities and think about what to do, you can make people like the protagonists have a better life, build laws that protect them, and find ways to make them grow and live healthily and healthily. I feel that it is a major focus of the whole movieExcept for the scenario of the script, which seems to be familiar, the quality of the others is really good. Whether it is cold violence or direct violence, various small details reflect the psychological and physiological process of the current campus violence. The director knows the current situation of the violence in Chinese campus classes very well"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"In my obsessive annual pursuit to watch every Oscar-nominated film, I encountered Derek Tsang's ""Better Days"" (nominated for Best Film in the ""International"" category, and available on Prime). I didn't know what I was in for.It's ""about"" bullying, and viewers get an unflinching examination of how class and privilege reinforce the dynamics and how useless parents and school authorities are at protecting children. It was fascinating for me to see how bullying manifests in China. Not knowing much about Chinese culture, I questioned whether the violence, which rises to Matthew Shepherd levels of violence, was authentic. Then I read about the film, how it was based on a best-selling book in China, and drew enormous audiences there, grossing $230 million in its Chinese release. So it's also a statement about something that is receiving a great deal of popular attention there. To my eyes, the film is a powerful critique not only of bullying but of an educational system and a social system that separates and oppresses. I'd be interested to hear what others who know more about this think.So it was a socio/political eye-opener for me. But it's also an incredibly meticulous, multi-layered, and poignant work of art. Its story includes coming of age themes, first romance, and one even gets pulled into a tense police drama.All this is to say, I don't think enough attention has been paid to ""Better Days"", and I think anyone reading this post would be moved by it."
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,This is one of the best things I have ever watched in my life a though it's not that type of up lifting move. And as a person who has been bullied I deeply connected with Chen Nuan and when your bullied you don't really want to get revenge you just want to live your life and I felt that.
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Wow, just wow. This movie is pure amazing. You HAVE to watch it, can't recommend it enough! Based on a true story, the movie tells about bullying in high school, where people are struggling for university exams. High school girl Chen Nian finds her bullied classmate lying dead on the ground on campus after suicide, and then she is subjected to severe bullying as well. She meets a tough guy from the streets, who she later asks if he can protect her, which he agrees to ... and a strong bond between the two grows, but then something dramatic happens.This movie gave me a roller coaster full of emotions, on the deepest level! It made me so angry, sad and disturbed how people can be so cruel and heartless, many finding others in pain just amusing, something to laugh at! And it makes me speechless how people can just take photos of a dead body instead of calling the ambulance! Chen Nian was the only decent one, who covered her dead classmate's body with her jacket. But in midst of all misery, there is a glimpse of light and hope... this movie has lots of ugliness, but also lots of beauty. The most beautiful thing about Better Days, is the deep bond between Chen Nian and Xiao Bei / Bei Shan. Their bond is thicker than blood, they have a deep connection, like soulmates, it goes even deeper than that of lovers (its obvious they are in love with each other), rarely you find a special bond like this! At first, Chen Nian looked down on Xiao Bei for being poor, uneducated, having no goals in life, and just getting into fights. But when Chen Nian cannot anymore handle the severe bullying, she goes to him and ask him to protect her (which he offered her to do earlier but she declined), he agrees. And boy, he takes his ""job"" as protector very seriously and follows her around, walking always behind her. He is willing to go extreme lengths to keep her safe.There is one particular scene that touched me so much, it gave me goosebumps! I don't want to spoil too much, but it was after Xiao Bei found Chen Nian all beaten up... so yeah, the scene involves Xiao Bei and Chen Nian, it was that moment that made their bond soooo deep, the deepest kind of bond! When seeing that beautiful, meaningful scene, I knew this movie would become one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and my absolute number 1 favorite asian movie!I love that this movie is anti-bullying, it never blames the victim, all the blame goes to the bullies. I mean, this movie shows how some people puts some blame on the victim too, but the movie still manages to make it clear that how wrong it is for those kind of people to put blame on the victim. Chen Nian goes through hell, but some doesn't take it seriously and just says stuff like ""they are just teenagers, they don't know any better, so let it just be"". Luckily tho, not all are like that, for exemple the policeman Zheng Yi who really wants to help Chen Nian. He is speechless how people can defend the bullies, even more speechless how the bullies has not even a hint of remorse!One evening, something very dramatic happens. And Xiao Bei's pure and deep love for Chen Nian makes him go great great lenghts for her. Better Days deals first of all about bullying, second is the relationship between Chen Nian and Xiao Bei, but I found both equally as important. The acting of Zhou Dong Yu (who potrayed as Chen Nian) and Jackson Yee (who potrayed as Xiao Bei) is amazing, the acting couldn't be more amazing. Actually, all actors did a wonderful job! And the cinematography is A++! Honestly, this movie is pure perfection that touched deeply my soul. There is absolute nothing I would wanna change. This movie made it even more impacrful because its based on a true story, wow. And can you believe this masterpiece almost was never released, because of chinese censorship?? I'm so thankful it was released, it would be like a huge crime to not release a amazing movie like this with such important message. Obs, if you decide to watch this, remember to NOT turn off the movie when the closing credits comes, there is a bit more to come. I will definitely be rewatching Better Days soon again, I can't get this art of movie out of my head.. it's just THAT great!! Everyone should watch this!"
少年的你,Better Days (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"I have never seen a movie that i could finish and feel there was not a single flaw. 1000/10 this was incredible!!! It really highlighted the immense pressure of studying and exams and how that is used to measure success in life (especially in the movies' setting) paralleled with the harsh reality of life without familial support or education. The idea was pushed that the students experiencing bullying needed to reply on adults, regardless of the fact that it was the same adults who silenced them and told them to focus on their exams."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Here's a flick I've been looking forward to seeing for a few months, the 2019 Chinese animated feature ""White Snake"". It's a collaborative production between Light Chaser Animation and Warner Bros and is a prequel to a classic Chinese legend that's been adapted many times before in different media. The trailer did well to hook me in with its great concept and visual style, so the day the Blu-ray came out I wasted no time getting it. Worth. Every. Cent.Plot: This tale is about Blanca, an amnesiac woman found by Ah Xuan, a free-spirited young man from a snake catcher village. As the pair travel together and develop feelings for each other, Blanca soon discovers her true identity. She is a snake demon caught in an epic struggle between her clan and a power-hungry general dabbling in the dark arts. Can a human and demon truly be together in the face of such hatred and darkness?Snakes are often negatively portrayed in Western media and while there's more of a push to have them outside antagonistic roles (like Master Viper from ""Kung Fu Panda""), Eastern cultures always had more respect for them. The legend of the White Snake in particular had me intrigued and this movie made me love the character. The art style bears some resemblance to Disney's, cartoonishly expressive while having enough detail to go around, though it still feels like its own thing. The vibrant colors, no matter the setting and mood, always grab your attention, so you get your eye candy's worth from the vast mountains to a hidden demon marketplace. The landscapes, magic, and creatures are brilliantly brought to life with stunning designs, especially Blanca's majestic snake form. There are also a good number of fast-paced action scenes, complete with martial arts, cool-looking magic each character brings, and a bit of monster fighting with the fluid animation allowing for some really great angles and moves live-action couldn't achieve.At the center is the romance between Blanca and Ah Xuan, which is executed wonderfully. They have a precious chemistry, their personalities and conflicts complementing each other and providing something missing in their lives, leading to a very heartfelt conclusion. It also plays into the film's themes of love and change as well as pointing out the contradictions and mutual hatred of their species; neither side is entirely good or bad. I also like the other characters like Blanca's fierce sister Verta, Ah Xuan's comedic dog, and especially this playfully seductive fox spirit who has a great design. The voice acting is pretty spot on with the English dub in particular featuring Stephanie Sheh (Hinata from ""Naruto"") as Blanca and James Sie (Jackie from ""Jackie Chan Adventures"") as the evil general.I should note that, despite its appearance, this film is PG-13. Some people do die a bit brutally (albeit not much blood) and there's also a love scene (the most you see, though, is a topless back). This is a story told in a more mature manner, a demonstration that just because something is animated doesn't mean it's exclusively for kids. For me, this works to the benefit of ""White Snake"", letting it live up to its full potential in storytelling. It's a beautiful, alluring, and refreshing fantasy worth checking out."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Bai She Yuan Qi is a Chinese animation based on the famous love story of White Snake and human. What I heard before was that one who white snake fell in love was the one who wanted to capture and kill her. But in this one, it's totally different. Still, the story is amazing.Normally, I really don't like to watch love story films, but this animation? I really watched the whole thing even it's about love story. The plot is so great and also very touchable. The love story between white snake and human is so touchable and great. The story is beautiful but it's not entirely a happy ending love story. I cried in the nearly end scene. I really wished that it had happy ending.To be honest, when I saw this on a website, I really didn't hope the animation would turn out to be a great one. I'm not underestimating it. But compared to Hollywood animations, I really had a thought that Chinese animation can't be compared. So, when I watched this animation, I really thought it wouldn't be this great. But I was completely wrong. Not only the story is great, but also the animation skills are great. The characters are pretty and the way they animated the characters are so smooth. There's no fault to point out. The whole thing is so great.All in all, this animation didn't seem to be a great one on the outside, but it is incredibly and unbelievably great inside. Although it's about love, but the character development and the plot are so great. The places they created, the ideas and all, everything's so great. Hence, it's totally a great animation to enjoy. I totally love this one and I've completely enjoyed every second of it."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"This movie has it all magic, snakes, love and so much more.I am glad i got to see it fantastic."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The legend of the white snake is a family-know fairly tale among the Chinese people. I have already seen many editions about the love story between lady White snake and the Dr. Xu. But there are only few words describing why Lady W fall in love with her boy friend.In this movie, the screen writer successfully combined the legend of white snake and another famous classic novel - the story of snake catchers. I think it is a great idea.in addition, the film scenes are fantastic and the characters are beautiful. 9/10 is a reasonable grade for it."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"A Titanic love story that is taking place in China! It's the classic ""star-crossed lovers"" story that competes above and beyond Titanic (1997)'s Jack and Rose, but with popular and significant Chinese folktale elements! I am glad that Light Chaser Animation became true to its roots. There are some mild sexual content in it, but overall, the movie's breathtaking sceneries and plot overrides any of the movie's sexual connotations. Growing up with Japanese animation, I expect a Japanese anime-vibe to this movie. But it's more than that! It can visually stun both video game players and Disney & Pixar fans because of its action sequences, storytelling, music, and character development! This is the most beautiful, heartwarming, touching, and endearing film to hit China (and hopefully, North America)! But since there's not enough North American audience who are aware of the White Snake folktale; it's only playing in few selected theatres. But when it's out in English (whether dubbed or subtitled), I will definitely part with some of my money to purchase this thrilling tale!"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The animation was excellent. It was visually stunning to sit there and watch the animation go by, which works well for me because I don't speak the language and I don't like to read and watch animation.Overall, a great experience."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"It is a truth that Chinese animation production is at a primary stage,and in fact the story is old school,but it is a great progress compared to other Chinese animation film.another attration is the film gives us a new,different story unlike the original. Although there is still a long way for this kind of movie ,but I think it gives me both a visual and mesmerizing feature"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"1. Animation quality was uncharacteristically quite good for a Chinese animation. Backgrounds were more detailed than usual, except lower rating because they were static unmoving. Foreground central character/scenes were quite realistic in some respects such as hair & movement, except facial & other main details were 2-D flat.2. English voicing was quite good possibly using Hong Kong educated voice actors - not sure.3. Storyline was exceptional. An actual historic myth slightly modified to be movie appealing to most audiences (younger viewers may not like the violence). Very creative, seldom seen twists 'n' turns. China has many myths that translate well as animations and I hope this production crew continues with more such stories."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Seeing an animation movie of this qiluality coning from China is amazing. Salute guys.You've nailed it.The story night not be the basic story of The legend. But the flow and the logic is on the spot.Audience no longer looking at how the picture was made. Which is notrmal when seeing non holywood films. So we go with the flow of the story and enjoy the ride we did. Great achievement.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"It was and felt good to see it.The animation was very good, right up there with the disney standards if not better.The story it seems is deep rooted in the chinese culture but otherwise too it made some impact. Nice, swashbuckling adventurous ballad for all ages. Once again, the animation was way up there with the leaders in the Market."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Recently I saw a Chinese animated film ""Bai She"". I give this movie a 10/10. I loved it. It was beautiful, entertaining, sexy, a sophisticated animated film intended for adults. The quality of the animation was superb. I was truly blown away. I don't think I've ever seen an animated film as good as this. I hope that everyone around the world gets a chance to see ""Bai She""!"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"It's nice, but predictable and nothing special. Just a love story with a happy ending, the only difference between it and most others is that it's between a snake demon and a human, snake catcher."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"This film tell story of Chinese old tale, white snake. This story is revised from Chinese opera and old story. This film can be regarded as a independent story ahead of the story of traditional White Snake. Of course, I agree the plots are old without any novelty. However, the pictures are so beautiful and the music is so charming. Some ideas are from the film of Hong Kong director Hark Tusi's (Ke Xu) , Green Snake. Also, some music are from Yazhi Zhao's drama, White Snake. It is a common memory of Chinese. If you are a Asian, I recommend you to see the film to call back your childhood memory. If you are not a Asian, it is a nice chance to know Chinese culture."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I have read a lot reviews about this movie. And when it comes to Chinese movies, reviews more or less come with political bias. And I hope, my review can clear things up a bit.This is a well animated movie, for average movie goers the animation is more than acceptable. But does the animation reaches 2019 Pixar standards? No, the expression on the character is limited, specially on Ah Xuan. The skin and body lack elasticity and weight, and the cloth dynamic is weird. What stands out technical wise, is the background and sets. They are painstaking made to resemble traditional Chinese ink paintings. The animator took the full liberty of making the fight scene, they are a visual spectacle. Super-nature powers, light beams, mythical creatures fills up the screen at times, which may not be everybody's cup of tea. But sure is entertaining.There are complains about the storytelling element. For the Chinese, the story of white snake is one of the most well known fiery tells. It is like the story of Santa Claus or tooth fiery for the westerner. For that reason, the creators did skip the world building part, expecting the viewers can fill in the rest. It is also true that the tempo is sometimes slow for this movie, but after all, the white snake story was always a love story and not a action film.And the biggest controversy of this film, the sexual under tone. This movie features an animated kiss scene, sexy villain and implied sex scene. Some people are offended because they think CG animation are for Children. But this is a love story, more importantly in the fiery tell white snake was pregnant with Xu Xian's child. How do they have a Child without having sex? And I don't want to Discourage anyone, the sexual tone is a very minor part of this story. It kind of feel like 2D Disney style sexual tone.In conclusion, great movie with a non-western story. I see you are a man of culture as well."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Chinese animation has risen.I hope that more foreign friends can enjoy this movie. Although there are cultural differences that cannot be fully appreciated, White Snake is still worth buying tickets."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Blanca is a white snake demon (that doesn't make her a bad person) who is tasked to kill the evil Black General with a hairpin. The plot fails and she has amnesia living as a human in a human village. She falls in love and rediscovers her past.The film had great color animation. There is a ""love scene"" where Blanca removes her clothes and lays on top of Xuan. It is viewed from a distance and all we see is her back. The film gets boring in the village but picks up to a violent action film. I loved the two-faced wolf/ human character."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"""White Snake"" is based on the old Chinese legend of the White Snake, in which a half-woman, half-snake being falls in love with a human man. This movie is, in essence, a prequel to the original tale, which has since been adapted into many different mediums. In this adaptation, the White Snake is named Blanca. She lives and meditates with her ""sister"" (though not by blood), the Green Snake, Verta. Blanca, while living so long in peaceful seclusion, has forgotten what has happened in her past life, and must learn of it via a magic jade hairpin Verta owns. There she learns of the role she played in a magical war, and even who she fell in love with. The rest of the film is the entire memory held in the hairpin.""White Snake"" is a gorgeously animated Chinese movie that rivals the fantastical visual spectacles of ""Moana"" and ""Frozen II."" Especially the way they manage to make nature look, like grass waving in the wind, the sun setting on a horizon, the light of fire on a character's faces, the fur on a squirrel's back and tail, the water from a waterfall, the simple ripple in a river, reflections in metal, the textures in wood, the light of the moon against architecture, the size and scale of the White Snake's true form, the feathers on the three-headed bird, and even the layers of a kimono on a characters skin. Action scenes are fluid and have a very nice flow to them. There is a sense of weight to every character's actions, as well as a momentum to the way the snakes swing and jump through the trees. The animation also knows when to take its time and when to rush ahead, and it is due solely to the animation you believe the relationship between Blanca and the human man. So many designs of characters and shots can tell you exactly what a character is about by the way they move, and they stick with you. Some shots of the landscapes in this film have stuck with me longer than most in mainstream animated films from America, including Disney films. The only issue I have with the animation is that most of the female characters have eyes much bigger than those of their male counterparts. The men have relatively smaller eyes, while Blanca, Verta, and the Shopkeeper all have much larger eyes.The writing in this movie is not good, though that could have been a problem with the Chinese-to-English translation. Theres a line where Blanca says ""A strange girl with strange powers, she could be human or demon"" in reference to herself, talking to someone on a boat. I have some issues with some sentences like this where characters speak things that do not need to be spoken, but that is a little expected with translated movies (though I do not believe that should be an excuse).This movie is also not meant for children. Snakes are very sexual beings, and I that is highlighted a bit in the relationship between Blanca and Verta. They are comfortable in whatever body suits them, and that is something that I can praise. But my biggest problem with this movie is actually the fact that at the height of Blanca's emotional turmoil, coming face-to-face with the history that she is indeed a demon, she decides to get sexual with the human man. I would be okay with this if there was more development to the romance before we got to this point, or if it happened at a different point in time. Especially because immediately after, Blanca decides to leave him and accept her dark fate she learned about from the temple's history. So this ""romantic"" scene is pointless in the flow of the story.My other problem with the movie is they do not explain the importance of ""human vitality"" as put by the Shopkeeper. They often ""show, don't tell"", which is a good rule in filmmaking, but it would help to know how vitality is important. The only thing that we learn is that it helps fuel demon weaponry and magic, and it is only found in humans.My last problem with the movie is the same problem I have with the ""Frozen"" films. We never find out the limits of her power, or even Verta's power for that matter. We only know that the snakes can change their forms, but we never find out why Blanca and Verta can float in their human forms, what force comes from their hands when they meet each other in the woods, why Verta can soothe people in their sleep, and why Blanca can shoot white energy ribbons from her hands. What makes them more special than the other snakes?One of the other great things about this movie is the score in the background. There is a nice traditional Asian sound to the score that is especially prevalent in the action scenes, reminding me of the sounds from ""Legend of Korra"" and ""Kubo and the Two Strings"". They help to boost emotional scenes and put energy into quick-moving action scenes. Another note of mention is that the comic relief dog character is not a total annoyance like most comic relief characters are. I do not even like dogs, but this guy was actually funny.The ending scene leaves the movie open for a sequel that recreates the original tale of the White Snake, but allows for a change in style in clothing due to the passage of time. There is also an end credits scene that creates a mystery as to what is in the river.In summation, ""White Snake"" is one of the best animated movies of 2019, even better than Disney's ""Frozen II"". It is a beautiful sounding and looking movie that has some interesting interactions between characters and a tragic yet beautiful ending, but has a few strange scene choices and some unexplained mythos. I recommend the movie to anyone who is above the age of 13, unless you are ready to explain a few things to your children."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The legend of the White Snake is a household name in China. The animation of this film, very Chinese characteristics, perhaps this is why some people are not used to it. However, if someone says the word ""disgusting"", I really do not know if such a person's aesthetic is not a problem or what other reasons. Come on, people like that. Learn more about Chinese traditional culture, look at Beijing opera, look at ink painting, and then carefully understand the legend of the White Snake. It is believed that such a person will change his mind and enjoy the film."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I'm not usually one for animated movies, let alone having to read them as well as way them. I literally could not take my eyes off the movie, the subtitles didn't even matter around 10 minutes into the movie. The graphics were great, the story was amazing, and actors although i couldn't understand them, still drove emotion into the characters that i ( a stern movie critic ) absolutely loved.I can't wait until there is a number 2 of this, and by heck i believe there should be.Thank you all for the movie, i thoroughly loved it."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"At first I thought this was a condensed alternate retelling of the Legend of White Snake main story, but by the end they make it obvious this is a prequel, this is just a ""past life"" of our main characters. The main story is what you can see in the 36-episode 2019 TV series ""The Legend of White Snake"".The CGI here is excellent in terms of still-image look, but when animated it suffers from excessive speed, especially during combat scenes, and from a lack of weight of most characters and objects - everything lands like a feather on top of everything else, there is no impact, nothing has weight, which makes it less believable. Then there are some weird choices with oversexualizing the female characters in some scenes, and even the male character at one point, even though it's supposedly done as a joke. OTOH there was also some Disney-style comic relief thrown in, which also seemed out of place in an essentially Chinese production.The plot is not too coherent or compelling but it works, and the main love story is also unconvincing, with no real chemistry between the two, but for me this was fine - I had already seen the main story in the TV series, and that had more than enough chemistry going on, and in a perfect family-friendly winter season PG-13 type presentation.""Bai She 2"" from 2021 you can just ignore, it's a complete perversion with cars and motorcycles, the true sequel to this movie is the 2019 Legend of White Snake TV series."

白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,China had 2 animated Blockbusters this year and it was Ne Zha and White Snake. Let us see what China will have of sleeper hits of next decade like a possible White Snake 2 and more. Stream this on the biggest TV you can buy if you love Asian movies.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The standards of Chinese animation has definitely progressed in leaps and bounds since their initial clumsy clunky attempts at animation storytelling back in the early 2000s. This production could have easily come out from any of the top top Hollywood animation studios such as Pixar, Dreamworks or Blue Sky. You can see that there is a lot of investment in resources to make this work The artwork is excellent, and the movement of the characters crisp and on point. And most important, the creativity! Particularly impressive were the scenes at the Jade Magic Workshop. The transition is seamless. As far as the story goes, it's drawn from the Chinese myth of the ""Legend of the White Snake"", which would be familiar to most of East Asia.. Nonetheless, for Western audiences, best for them to see this with an open mind, and be transfixed by the wondrous images on screen."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Animation for kids, although they are inspired to have quite a bit of a fantasy. Also there is tension and fights and danger and quite a bit more that also adults might and probably will like. The movie is quite interesting if you are into the Fantasy genre and don't mind animation ... well you have a winner here.It may a bit too overdramatic for some, but if you think about the intended target audience that should not be a surprise. This does what it says on the ""box"" and quite nicely too"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Baishe :: Yuaqi - The white snake . Animated Movies tend to focus more on animations and 3D story telling, while the actual screenplay and story takes a back seat.

白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"When I saw the poster I decided to watch it. I had a good feeling about it for two reasons A) I loved the story because I watched many versions of this ancient Chinese folklore in form of TV series, animation and Chinese opera during my life in China B) I love cartoons and animation. I was amazed by the beautiful cinematographic aspects of it, the music and poetic scenes. The director of film did a good job. Great script, film directing and editing. I loved it so much that I became emotional and cried at the end. So many creative people were involved in this project after seeing the credit at the end and I would like to congratulate them for succeeding to bring to life such an amazing animation. I look forward to watching your next project. Thank you."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The first hour is not merely good, it is brilliant. The animation features a use of color that is rare and awe inspiring, almost magical. And the underlying love story is unique and magnetic. The second hour lacks the precision, the perfection, of the first hour but even then the movie as a whole is something you will never forget. Or want to forget."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The story is interesting, though the plotline seems a little too slowly paced. I think about fifteen minutes could have been shaved off here and there and by tightening the film, it might have had a slightly better impact. The strongest aspects goes to two things of the entire movie. First, there's the animation, It's so beautiful with a wonderfully detailed look of the village, forest, waterfall etc. The character animation is so stunning and very realistic with facial expressions on them. The best aspect of the animation goes to the character animations on the snakes with an excellent look. Then, there's the score from Guo Haowei, It fits very well with the moments in the movie, and also intensifies the action scenes. Same goes with the voice acting, the actors did really well voicing their respective characters.In conclusion, White snake is a good animated film that features an odd but touching love story, with a Titanic-like ending. Tho it's slow paced at times but the wonderful animation and overall brilliant technical aspects of the film will keep one entertained throughout"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I grew up with this film, so it was bit childhood memories rewind when i see this one. The animation was totally super good, the story was good as well, and i think this is the prequel based from what i saw at the end of the movie."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The Good:A clear and direct modern adaptation of an ancient Chinese story. The character design is superb and on point, competing directly with both high-budget western titles. Beautiful animations (where it's not rushed).The Bad:Would cause confusion amongst both Western and Eastern audiences. The scene where Xuan and Blanca gets trapped inside the derelict ""exorcism"" chamber would not make any sense to both Western and Eastern audiences alike. The eight doors which Xuan deducts from are in reference to the Irregular Gates, which itself is associated with the Eight Gates, the Gate of Life, of Death, of Closing, of Brilliance, of Rest, of Fright, of Opening, and of Injury. Character development-wise, we never fully understood the purpose of the grandmother. What was her relation with any of the villagers? Was she a relative of Xuan? Why didn't Xuan leave her at his place, because he's a doctor?The Unsophisticated:There are clear signs that the movie was rushed and was overbudget. In several scenes, character detail drops significantly and the animation goes from an A+ grade to a B-, looking rushed and unpolished. In some areas, liquid simulation also seemed off, making it more shiny and slimy than it actually is. Furthermore, in some parts of the movie, such as when Xuan get's turned into a demon, the movie suddenly changes in refresh rate, going down from 24p to something like 15p, adding onto the unpolished feeling of the movie. The movie also often cut to black to transition to different scenes, breaking the audience's attention, and bringing dissonance to the story telling. It's fine to show sudden scene changes where it applies, for example when Blanca get's knocked out, but suddenly fading to black and jumping to the river scene after the general's right-hand man's monologue? That just feels cheap and uncreative. For reference, it cuts to black six times. Another gripe is the scorching death scales. How the hell is the General even able to extract the scales when they're activating? Even the Master claimed that she was beyond her bounds should they activate, yet a mere mortal is able to. In the end, the scales don't even serve any real purpose. It doesn't do anything, and when it seems like its supposed to? The General just spits them out and they disappear for the rest of the movie."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Lots of things going on in many scenes make the fantasy hard to fully understand (for the uninitiated like me), but everything looks so cool and beautiful, and the general love story shines through! :-)"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,I have just fallen love with White Snake. I want the director to make part 2 of this movie.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The editing is messy. The plot is predictable and lacks any sense of credibility. The animation is fine, but the visual effects are cheap and lousy. Production design and character design are disturbing and disgusting. The film simply takes advantage of people's nostalgia of white snake."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Magic has turned into some sort of cool elements nowdays, but in this animation, magic and magic creatures are more like its original form: dark, wrong and haunted. When the first time the young snake catcher fall in love with that white snake(in human form), he has already stepped into the oblivion. Strongly suggested, if you are anime lover"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,I was amazed by the animation its like some of mobile legend characters and i remember the Classic Titanic Movie in 1997 at the endVery nice
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Good animation amazing story Best movie of the year the plot is good
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,The main characters are wonderful. They are there for each other and care about one another. The movie is essentially about how bad things happen but you have to still look for the good in life.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"It's no faint praise when I say that I was reminded of the movie ""Princess Mononoke"". I would even dare say it is comparable in quality of storytelling, details and flow in movement of animations and details. It's not only a gorgeous movie with a great script in par to anything Disney (as of late), it managed to create a very interesting world within just 1 hour and 40 minutes. It is vague (in a good way), magical and very well made. The characters, villain and developments are all top notch. I can't recommend it enough.I honestly can't wait for the sequel!!"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The white snake tell the love story of star crossed lovers Blanca and xuin. Everything about the movie was awesome including the soundtrack,cgi and the emotions.I highly recommend it for everyone"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,The fox looks very sexy and one of the most attractive characters in it.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Very beautiful animation. Story is awesome too as well as the music and songs. Recommend to watch.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"This was Visually stunning, beautifully written and directed. I'm American so my Chinese history is nil but amazing films like these will make it an honor to learn more. We have become so arrogant that we dont notice the art from other countries. I'm opening my eyes and heart to more culture via movies!! This was just breathtaking, my wife and I loved every second of this masterpiece of art . If you have the chance take it and watch you'll be extremely glad you did. This is the definition of entertainment!!"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Full of feeling and high quality with a great story made an Amazing animation.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I recommend it to those who are genuinely interested in Chinese mythology, romance and drama genres, and top-tier animation (it's soooo beautiful, really)! Both the story and animation were AMAZING, but the story could've been improved in some parts (like adding more background info pertaining to Blanca, the demons, and Xuan); but that doesn't mean the movie isn't good, though! I can't wait for the movie's sequel!Also, on a side note, this movie is intended for ages 12/13 above, since there are numerous scenes with blood and death... And a moderately intimate scene between two characters we all know and love ;)"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Just WOW!!😍 Love the idea of making white snake make relation with snake catcher... Also ameizing animation quality😍😍 all characters are so beautiful 😍
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,One of the since kid favourite tale.This is a nice well made cartoon although not superbly made. Till a good watch animation movie.
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The colors are too thick, strong, too artificially strong, very unnatural. The eyes of the women were over-the-top deformed to the traditional bias by theWestern racism, always insulting the Chinese by describing they got ""Slant Eyes"", just like the white Americans always insulting their neighboring Mexican people with ""Wet Back"". Same biased insult also applied to the Chinese words if in English, always using ""Bamboo"" like thick, distorted letter forms in green or red.This is not a cartoon that I could appreciate very much, even it's a fairy tale."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I was surprised about this movie. Beautiful animations with really impressive pictures and colors. Wonderful to watch and not much worse than a Pixar movie. The story was pretty nice too, liked that it had some more serious scenes (e.g. Blood). Happy I found and watched it."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Amazing animation! To sum it up, its basically an ancient chinese mythical westside story take on Romeo and Juliette kind of story, but more epic :)"
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,I am purely amazed abiut magic Chinese fairy tales and how love nomatter how it's presented always wins!
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"I love chinese culture but this film is about something else. Please don't let your kids watch this. I am an anime,cartoon and manga fan but i really didn't like this and i can't point a solid thing,i watched it like iam watching a kid cartoon that's why i didn't like it. It is an adult movie and i am not saying just because of the sex scene,for example kicking a dog in a kid movie is a normal thing? Or little creepy little old men try to touch a child looking creature..I felt like this movie is try to normalize some matters for children, for people. Please don't let your kid watch this."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"Seriously though....White Snake (not Whitesnake) is a retelling of the Chinese legend in which a white snake demon falls for a human.Famously adapted into live action Cantonese romantic movies, this CG action version is by a mainland Chinese studio.Animation is an excellent choice for the epic vistas and stylish magical battles. Unfortunately they are punctuated by awkward characterisation and dialogue.Nevertheless, the characters are relatable enough, and the plot has enough twists to hold viewers through to the next fight sequence.Less 'Is this Love'. More 'Judgement Day'."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,"The movie was great. I don't know much about the story itself, but I feel like maybe this movie should get a sequel. Cause I feel like there should be more especially after what happened in the ending."
白蛇：缘起,White Snake (2019),,2019,2019.11.15,Animation 10/10English dubbing 6/10Story 3/10You really need to know the chinese white snake legend before seeing this movie. Without knowing the story makes no sense. I just finished watching and I can't tell you what the movie is about.
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"The Good: I think it's safe to say that the film's highlight is the expertly crafted and powerful action scenes. This movie is clearly trying to recall and homage Chinese war stories of old and it does a really good job of doing that, visually. The action scenes are fantastic and I was surprised as to how tasteful the blood and gore was here; I sorta went into this expecting a brutal ride.Initially, I felt the film's lack of character development was a negative. On reflection, I think this might be a cultural bias on my part and also not entirely appropriate for the story. American war films tend to focus on individual(s) for storytelling and emotional purpose. I think this approach, focusing on a group of basically unremarkable people, is actually a really effective way of making this battle feel like...well, a battle in a larger conflict. That while this moment mattered, ultimately, the war was not won that day.I also have to applaud the set and costume designers...WOW. The International Concession set is so immaculate and bursting with life, I felt transported into the past when watching those scenes. The contrast with the abandoned, decaying warehouse is truly striking.The Bad: I'm a little conflicted as to whether or not to include this, but the dub of this movie is absolutely terrible. I felt like I was watching extended video game cut scenes; the voice actors almost never sound appropriate for what it happening on screen. Again, I don't know if this is fair or not, but the dubbing made what was supposed to be emotionally powerful into a farce.However, this criticism will be universal, whether you're watching the English dub or Chinese original. This movie is as subtle as a brick through a window. I understand what this particular time in history means for Chinese people, but damn...is this as propagandistic as they come. It's sometimes hard to take seriously and yes, I acknowledge culture plays a part in this.The Ugly: On that point, this movie's ra-ra patriotism may be a bit refreshing for audiences who have come to expect war films to be, by default, ""anti-war."" Surely this movie isn't pro-war, but it's realistic in that it acknowledges war is a part of the human story and sometimes, the unjust thing to do is to shy away."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"This is a Remake about a historical event. It may be a bit hyped and exaggerated and has quite the nationalistic take (pride wise) to it - something US movies also like to do to the same degree. Hopefully you don't have an issue with that, otherwise you'd deprive yourself of quite the intense and harrowing movie! And visually ... I mean wow, just wow.How it all was built, the amount of preproduction it took, the stunts and so many other things make me want to say ""great job"". The violence is quite vivid and there is a lot of blood and brutal depictions of injuries and death. Amongst all that there still is character development (and some cliche and over dramatized things too of course)! That is not an easy feat to achieve ... but the movie does it. And even with 2,5 hours (and an odd 15 minutes missing or so probably will be forever lost, since the director had to cut them to get a rating in China) the movie never feels like it is too long ... very well done indeed!"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"It's 1937. Japanese forces have attacked the city of Shanghai. The foreign concessions become an island of civilization among the destruction of the city. Around 800 Chinese soldiers have fortified a warehouse across a canal from the concession area. They are mostly soldiers armed with the latest weapons from Nazi Germany. They are joined by some stragglers and a squad from the countryside. They hold out against overwhelming Japanese forces for months in front of an audience of international press and their fellow Chinese citizens.First, the movie spends too much time showing scared and incompetent soldiers. Some of it is useful but it really makes it frustrating to root for the Chinese soldiers. The long-haired guy is really annoying. It may work if he's the only one but the movie seems to relish showing the Chinese soldiers as weak scared little boys. The balance is off. The real force consists of mostly well-trained troupes but the camera spends more time with the others who get collected. The flag section is a good high point except throwing that many bodies onto the flag is ridiculous. It's more effective to concentrate on one guy picking up the fallen flag and putting it back up. Finally, this uses too much slow motion especially in the last act. It could have more effective to let the brutal action overwhelm the senses. As a true war story, this is primed for a great telling but this is only partially good. Westerners may not like the portrayal of Nazis and I'm surprised that Communist China is willing to make Nationalist soldiers into heroes. Again, the Chinese soldier fighting with Nazi gear is going to be weird for a western audience. As a Chinese war movie, this is better than most. It looks great and it's compelling to watch."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"While everbody seems to be going crazy over Christopher Nolan's new science-fiction epic Tenet, I must admit that I have prefered Chinese historical military drama The Eight Hundred a little bit more. The movie tells the story of a few hundred Chinese soldiers who desperately attempt to defend a warehouse against Japanese invaders. While national and international spectators idly observe the relentless battle from the other side of Suzhou Creek, the desperate soldiers realize that they are all alone on a suicide mission to defend their position, city and country.This epic movie convinces on numerous levels. The story is overall historically accurate which isn't the case for some other recent Chinese movies that depict their own people as unbeatable heroes and their opponents as relentless criminals. The realistic characters in this movie feel refreshingly human and have flaws and strengths. Some soldiers try to betray their brothers in arms to save their lives, secretely escape from the warehouse or simply try to hide to avoid fighting. However, it's great to see that even the oldest cowards, youngest deserters and stupidest egoists end up facing their deadly challenges and fighting for a better tomorrow. The character development in this film is excellent and it's easy to empathize with several of the diversified characters, varying from disillusioned children over overambitious military personnel to nostalgic elders. The locations look incredibly authentic and bring Shanghai in the late thirties to life in a visually stunning way. The contrast between dead bodies, destroyed buildings and dirty battle equipment on the north side of the river and ladies with fancy make-up, elegant casinos and contemporary vehicles on the south side of the river is truly captivating. The big-budget sound and visual effects are gripping and should be enjoyed at your local cinema as even the best set-up in your living-room couldn't bring the dramatic battles to life. Despite a length of two and a half hours, the film has great pace and especially the first three quarters go by very quickly.This movie would have been excellent if it weren't for its last quarter. The movie suddenly jumps back and forth in the timeline and focuses on redundant discussions and lengthy speeches that add patriotic pathos but considerably slow down the film's excellent pace. The final forty minutes or so could have been told in fifteen minutes and been much more impactful.Despite that minor flaw in the film's final quarter, The Eight Hundred is one of the best military dramas in recent memory. The story is mostly historically accurate, the sound and visual effects are impressive, the characters have depth and development and the acting performances are accurate, diversified and empathic. It might even be a great idea to transform this intriguing story into a television series at a certain point. Don't hesitate to watch this movie with English subtitles at your local cinema as The Eight Hundred is definitely the best movie of the year so far."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,Thrilling war drama with plenty of action and connections with the main charactersDid not know of this part of Chinese history so made the film more interesting.
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"1937. The Second Sino-Japanese War is raging and the Japanese Army has the upper hand. In Shanghai the Chinese Army is falling back but the 524th Regiment holds on at Sihang Warehouse. The 452 defenders (exaggerated to 800 for the public) hold on against overwhelming odds in what will become an epic last stand.The actual events of the Battle of Sihang Warehouse are the stuff of legend: 452 defenders holding out against about 20,000 for several days, providing a massive morale boost to the population of the Republic of China. This film tries to capture that heroism but does so clumsily and hammily.Rather than concentrating on the military tactics we have sub-plots involving insignificant, generic characters. Concentrating on average people is supposed to increase the engagement factor but here, because the sub-plots are so clichéd and silly, it has the opposite effect.Many of the tactics and actions don't seem very accurate either. The writers and director mistake foolhardiness for bravery with some very stupid actions disguised as heroism. Their idea of a battle also seems to largely involve explosions and inane shouting.Add in some next level hammy acting and the film is often embarrassing to watch.On the plus side, the cinematography, CGI and backdrops are great. These do give a very authentic feel to proceedings (even if the plot and acting doesn't!)."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"The Eight Hundred was the biggest grossing film of 2020 , beating Tenet but it's not surprising when you think about it. It was released during the pandemic and China has a population of over two billion , so in theory they could beat Hollywood every year.Having said all that , this is a much better film than Tenet anyway .It's the story of a group of Chinese soldiers and draft dodgers , in 1937 who put up a four-day defence of a Shanghai warehouse complex just as Japanese forces are overwhelming China.This film looks amazing. As war films go it's right up there and i was surprised to see it only cost only eighty Million dollars. Perhaps that is because they didn't spent so much of the budget on actors wages as Hollywood , would normally ?I have to admit the logistics had me confused at times. I would have liked more of an explanation as to why one side of the river was so different to the other and why people of all nationalities were just watching the chaos go on .The acting was really good and i like the fact that they were not afraid to kill off main characters.It's biggest problem is it's too long . In fact it's that long the opening credits were still playing twenty minutes after the start of the film. I did think at one stage that i might have to watch it in two parts but thankfully i manages to see it through and in the long run , it was definitely worth it.I'm sure the Chinese people will have loved this. It does feel a little flag waving at times , almost as if it's a propaganda movie but i can forgive director Hu Guan for that because he has produced a stunning piece of work."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"The visuals of this film are artistically cinematic and very gritty. It's a beautiful picture with tons of on screen action. The director adds so many simultaneous events in each frame that it kept my eyes busy scanning the periphery to take it all in. This film has high budget written all over it. From the sets, customs, cgi, special effects and large cast it's very impressive. You can also see a lot of American and European cinematic influences in the film. Especially during the flag raising which was reminiscing of Iwo Jima flag raising. The gory firefights and sniper kills gets your heart running.Where the film falls short are the many overdrawn patriotic speeches and at first they are cool but become long on the tooth in this 3+ hour film which actually felt like four hours or more. Many scenes don't add much to the story and I think distracts from the film. I think this film could use an editor to shorten the film a bit and clear up the story."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Very much of a curate's egg here - epic production, very good CGI, very tough battle scenes, very cool period piece. But at the same time, very many typical modern clichés, as well as very trite dialog lines as well as some very predictable plot twists. Several times, the film was bordering between a very blatant parody and a very brutal war drama. This has made it a very mixed bag and therefore produced a rather sour aftertaste..."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I seldom review a Chinese movies I try my best here to give you an honest review..I don't what is the propaganda about where the movie tries to glorify Chinese as brave and bold but as I finished watching the movie I went to you tube to do more research and reviews . What I finds out amazed me the whole river set was actually built from scratch whilst the building too.. it was real building and people in it not done green cgi screen.This is the first impressive Chinese mainland movie that use impressive CGI the action was top notch, it even shows the stronger side of Japanese which is much more superior in their battle wits which rarely you get to see in a Chinese movies, most of the Chinese Mainland or even Hong Kong Movies till now still depict Japanese as inferior during the WW2 periodThe movie also have some touching moments such as the last battle scene moments, the suicide bombing moments overall , the ending crossing the bridge moments etc.There are some down point too may be due to the director tries to fit in over more than 30 characters all in the movie with given time.. most of the character makes it very forgettable and hard to resonate too the director should cut down to 10-12 characters so that we can blend in with more characters.Overall it was a great movie.. no wonder the movie is the highest grossing movie in the world year 2020."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Writing this review in Point Form.My grumble with this film:Too much shouting and over the top acting BUT otherwise a watchable war film that recounts the ''Defense of Sihang Warehouse in 1937 Shanghai''.Some of the character dialogue scenes are hard to follow.I heard there is a 1976 version released in Taiwan, Have yet to see that one. I might do so just to cross references the events from 2 different perspective, CCP or China Communist Party and Republic Of Taiwan.What I like and learnt from this film:Gritty, Raw, Unfiltered violence film on IMAX camera. Before watching, I have never heard of the Defense of Sihang Warehouse in 1937 Shanghai. After watching it, did a readup on wikipedia, realised most of the stuff did happen."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"In 1937, WW2 has started for China, with the Japanese invasion. On the southern front, the Chinese army has abandoned a ruined Shanghai, except for one warehouse. This is defiantly defended by one regiment of about 800 troops, where seasoned professionals are reinforced by raw recruits of varying eagerness. The warehouse has 2 attributes: used as a bank vault, it has extra-thick walls; and it is across a small river from the English Concession. The foreign concessions are considered foreign territories by the Japanese, who try to avoid touching them. Thus we have the juxtaposition of a battlefield with a bustling, well-lit area, where crowds hang around the riverside street to watch the action, and the privileged (including foreign press photographers) watch from the balconies.The movie alternates between the warehouse action, and the events in the concession. In and around the warehouse, the action includes close combat, snipers, and occasional speeches. It is refreshing to see a Chinese action movie without martial arts. While there is blood and bandages, it is not the gorefest some western directors seem to like. There some of the Chinese soldiers are featured, whereas on the Japanese side only one commander had any speaking role. The switching to the concession side gives the audience a break from the action, and keeps the narrative fresh.This was based on actual historical events, and the movie included a final shot of the warehouse - with a backdrop of modern Shanghai skyscrapers. I read that the movie's opening was delayed, so that scenes of the national government could be cut. This government, or its successors, still govern the rebel island of Taiwan. But for the flag-raising scene, it was still the historically-accurate sun-in-sky national flag that went up."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"After enjoying the trailer, and being a fan of Asian cinema, I went to the movies to watch The Eight Hundred.As the movie is based on a true story and true events, it was very interesting to see a different kind of war film that's not Hollywood-ised and the great high quality production certainly was impressive.The movie is gripping, intense with solid tension building throughout the movie, lots of action guns and bombs with great performances that I believe the actors deserve great credit for.The writing and direction by Guan Hu was very impressive with nice stylised cinematography.My own dilemmas with the movie was the pacing, story beats and focus on the central story. The movie felt too split everywhere into different perspectives and doesn't focus on a singular character or group to follow the story properly.There was no clear goal or focus for us as the audience to keep an emotional core building. The essence of Chinese patriotism is the front runner story but I felt it took away from my attachment to following a core protagonist/s with their story instead of the theme or essence of patriotism.There's lots of invasion attempts and warfare action with some heartfelt emotional scenes, but not a clear storyline direction that makes it understandable to follow.Make sure to give this movie a go, it's definitely an experience!"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Reviving one of the most supreme display of Nationalism, Sacrifice and Courage. The story conclude the fact that true patriotism of a nation simply is inspiring and heartfelt by anyone across the seas.Must mention there's no words to explain the brilliance of the cinematography, just hypnotizing. Sounds and special effects are prefect and astonishing. Acting is so satisfying, genuine and hearty. Great viewing experience worth every second of time."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"This was simply amazing! Everything about this movie was great! That's what I love about true story movies that is done right, you get so captivated by it all. There were so many emotional scenes that caught my attention and made me cry but what blew my mind was when the suicide bombing started. That was just amazing. Great movie by all standards. The pace was perfect. The story very inspiring and emotional. For a second, I actually felt sorry for China, maybe they aren't as bad as they are made to seem. Hahaha"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"The movies is shown from a different aspect, which is something I haven't seen ever since hacksaw ridge. The movie tells a story that you might of never heard of but it's a battle you should know. This movie shows courage, unity, and braveness among the soldiers. It's very inspiring and I hope the future generations can witness it first hand. Truly a masterpiece!"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"It's overall a shocking experience watching this movie. A part which sadden me the most is between the bridge was hell and heaven.Most of the part was shoot in call of duty mode which take u inside the war zone. Everything thing done with a reasonable motive,strong character development which slowly move u to tears throughout the movie. Both Party soldiers was fighting bravely for their country. Never a minute of dull moment which keep u awake whole time."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Not all people like this movie coz this movie is quite nationlistic. However you can't simply judge this movie as a bad one coz ""there is not enough anti-war plot"". This movie is about self-defense and anti-oppression. If you don't know much about Chinese history please don't judge around. In the 1930s China was weak and the country was in great chaos. The imperial Japanese army took advantage of China's weakness and invaded China. Most Chinese people were numb and apathetic about the country and that's why at the beginning of the story, citizens besides the Suzhou river were not interested about the battle and they only care about their own living. Even some soldiers didn't know why they have to fight. As time went by, soldiers gradually woke up and realized what their mission was, citizens realized what the soldiers were fighting for. The soldiers were from different parts of the country and they had their own plans but finally they stayed together as a whole. The connection between soldiers were so great, and so natural. That's because we all share a same idea----we don't want to be ruled by brutal foreigners. If you don't like foreign ruling, you can feel this passion. Great amount of character development. The explosion is awesome. The director had planed and prepared this movie for yrs and you will feel amazing by all the visual effects."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I'd call this easily a milestone for Chinese War films, the cinematography and character development are rarely seen before in other Chinese war films.All the characters felt real, and relatable.The story is a bit chopped up, due to the unfortunate compliance issue with censorship. However I'd still give this movie a 10/10 simply because it tried and didn't fail."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"What in the hell did I just watch? Almost 3 hours of chaotic running around and incessant yelling. I have no clue who anyone is or what they are doing and why. Terrible, absolutely terrible."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"This is my third attempt at presenting a candor review of this film, after having my first review declined. Sitting through this two-and-a-half hour film was like sitting in a walled-in classroom while being shouted at with propaganda drivel. In summary, the acting was cartoonish with spoken (shouted) dialog (in any language) by actors phrased like they've been put on a hot-plate. Notwithstanding the historical topic, we can all agree that yes, fictionalizing drama amounts to good eye-catchers for profit. The CG and motion graphics -- which are perhaps the only true attraction cinematographically -- appear to be well-planned and funded, yet splatter the film with disgustingly cheap-looking scenes after scenes (despite the $80M budget?). Why there are 10-star reviews is perhaps the most surprising aspect of this film."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"9/10(Have spoiler!!!!)I am ethnic chinese so maybe I am not as unbias as I think I am on this film. :)There are 2 things I think viewer should understand and know before going to watch this film:1. This is a film definite have nationalism tone, it did not try to hide it. But its not political propaganda film of political party. Its the first mainland chinese major warmovie production that is entirely about Nationalist Chinese troops(Many may know them as Republic of China), and its entirely positive! It also almost have ZERO input about CCP and its troops (well,other then the end film text has few lines). So I think this is NOT a propaganda film, well not one for pro-Beijing at least, as it almost go entirely against Beijing's traditional teaching of Sino-Japanese war.2. This is war movie, not documentary. I see people complain about how few Nationalist soldier actually had die in the real battle compare to this film's. Well its entertainment film, its base of real event, and like many real event, the ""real thing"" are not full of actions and cant ""get your blood bumping"" so to speak. Also one thing I hope people watching this film will remember, this battle is part of Battle for Shanghai. Which fall to Imperial Japanese army after Nationalist had loost 4000men(KIA), also with 10 000-20 000civilian deaths. Also Japanese loses was quite high for the period, about 3000, reason likely been Nationalist chinese government had use its best but few in numbers German trained and armed division in this battle. So I think the film maker taking the dramatic license's and exaggerate this battle's scale should be forgiven.On of the most traumatic and dramatic about the film is it's setup, which is base on real event. Consider this, your nation is under attack by superior enemy force. Youre luckily to be stand in safe area own by other foreign power within in your own nation, which is bit odd in its self. As you stand in lively street of Shanghai that are full of life and entertainment, and as you look across the river, your nation burns on the other side, with street full of death and you watch as your nation's troops are battle a loosing battle and try to desperately hold on in a small piece of land. It must be a Surreal feeling for anyone that was there.+Film overall is well made, many scenes are beautiful, sad but beutiful. The shot of street full of entertainment and war torn battlefield across the river is stunning. The surreal feeling is there.+Most actors didnt over played, which sometime happens in chinese warfilms, which can cause the ""hero"" to sound/look like a clown.+Major plus to many soldiers speaking local dialect of chinese language. As at that time, the mandarin chinese was not set as official dialect yet(not enforced in schools).+Most battle scene are well plan and filmed. Its plus many battle scene are build as the survivors of that battle and people across that river have told after the war. Including the famous scene where Cheng Susheng jump off the building in to a group of japanese troops carrying a lot of hand grenades(but there was NO japanese ""shield war attack"" in the real battle).+Not many over the top gun play or bullet time is plus now days.+The major plus side of the film I think is its show off the Human side of soldiers in war. For a chinese war film and one with such clear a nationalistic tone, personally I see it as grows of chinese film industry that they did not make the invading Japanese army like all crazy monsters like typical chinese war films. And not Japanese soldiers are made out to be war crazy monster, there is one that beg for his life after been captured and is setup to be shoot. At same time not all chinese soldier were brave and heroic. Soldiers are order to use surrendered Japanese soldier as targets practice, there is the coward, there is some just want to go home.... Human side of these soldiers was well bring out.+-The nationalism tone is quite clear,which is minus. But as this film is base on event that is its self nationalistic event, kind hard to make film with that tone....so plus minus zero on this one.-The unkillable white horse is way too much. I am all for messaging within the film, but too much is too much.-The plane striking the flag over and over is also bit too much. Even as it really happen, but a scene's heroism overtone is bit too much.-Too many characters, most are bit too ""Soldier A"", ""Soldier B"". No deep at all. Also Some of characters are bit too clisse.-In messiness of combat, some of the characters are too hard tell apart."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,This movie creates a lot of emotion and makes you sympathize with the characters.
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"So, where do I start. Pros and cons.I will try my best to be rational rather than just hating or faking.First of all, the picture is great. Unlike many other war-theme movie made by Mainland China, the picture of those movies either look bad or just ok. However, this one doesn't look like a Chinese film like I used to know to be honest. The detail, the angle, and the structure are all above the top level. I don't have professional filming industry background, but as an audience living in both mainland China and US, I have watched tons of movies, and when it comes to war-theme movies, I can assure you this one isn't bad at all.Second, the detail of war. War is always tough. Living in the peace world for decades made people forget how bad the war is. I was raised in Xinjiang China, and came to the US since junior High. I've seen footage of the killing riots happened in both China and US such as 2009 ""7.5"" happened in Urumqi, 1989 ""6.4"" happened in Tiananmen, 1921 in Tulsa, and so many more, but those are not comparable with war-level event. Life somehow turned to just a number showing on the statistic excel sheet. Sacrifice was one of many words that I could think of of this movie, the tough thing is you have to deal with the real facts, which was Chinese army back then was weak, even the best troop they have was not on the same level with the Japanese army. Then, you see how they gon fight this war, they sacrifice lives to create opportunities for others, one dead another took over the spot, and that was just hard to watch. People are afraid to death, so are soldiers, but afraid is not an option, that's what makes soldiers different.Third, the story, and the politics behind the story. The movie was created based on a true historical story. I don't want to spoil here, but what I can say is that the movie showed at least big part of the history, and for most of Chinese people, that's some unknown history that they've never learned in the text book. When I was a kid, I used to live in China, the text book wont show much about how the NRP(Nationalist Party) contributed into this war against advanced Japanese Army. Your teacher will tell you exactly what they supposed to tell you, and yeah, the only good parts of CCP. Yet, the bad and the other parts was not told. I was fortunate to learn a lot of those unknown parts after coming to the US for high school. Just like anybody else, you may ask why the hell an army full of untrained soldiers with  weapons would beat German-level advanced Japanese Army? I had this question, but the answer was tough to know. We didn't beat them, we sacrificed many lives just to save more time so there's hope for a future that nobody know what's gonna look like. This movie showed exactly the toughness of NPR Soldiers and how bad they wanted to save the nation and the people. They didn't know what's coming to them, they didn't know 1937 was just a start, they didn't know CCP would be running the country after the war. However, nobody cares if they were from CCP or NRP, they were all fighting for Chinese people, and they were all heroes dead with honor.There was a line in the movie when a director was telling the army to retreat from the building, he said:""when all this is over, the world will remember this place, the world will remember you guys, and you are the real Chinese."" Try to think the meaning behind it, I bet you will at least notice something if you know the history of CCP and NRP."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"As the film industry in China has boomed over the last ten years, action and historical epics have been some of the biggest money-makers out there, but the quality has always been really disappointing. The Eight Hundred, however, manages to blend the blockbuster appeal of the genre with great storytelling, and an unbeatable passion that makes it a hugely inspiring watch.I'll happily admit that I've been all too ready to criticise Chinese blockbusters like this in recent years. Particularly when dealing with 20th century history, the genre has sensationalised events with an over-reliance on action, far-fetched stories and excessive CGI in a way that's very reminiscent of Hollywood in the late 1990s.The Eight Hundred, however, sees Chinese war blockbusters turn a corner. While it isn't a perfect film through and through, it's a brilliantly exciting combination of the intensity of war, as well as the patriotic spirit that drives a nation to survive against all the odds.For a film that largely takes place in one location - the warehouse and the riverfront across from it - it's quite incredible just how dynamic The Eight Hundred is. It's not a stationary, claustrophobic war thriller as you may expect, but an impressively sprawling epic that uses the context of the global political landscape of the era to great effect.Along with the incredible bravery of the soldiers within the warehouse holding off attacks from the Japanese, the film pays heed to the wider historical context, and how these Chinese soldiers were almost left as pawns in a greater political game, with people in the British concession of Shanghai watching on from a close distance, but not becoming directly involved.It's a really interesting angle that offers up a thought-provoking perspective on the nature of the Sino-Japanese War, and how complicit Western powers were in the events that unfolded. Should the British have gone in to help the Chinese, or was that too big a price to pay by inviting Japanese aggression unto themselves?One thing that's for sure about The Eight Hundred is its immense, undying patriotic spirit. You don't have to be Chinese to fall in love with this film's passion, and even though it may at times go to rather far-fetched lengths to show off that intense love for its country, there are some really inspiring moments on a par with some of the greatest in war cinema, including Saving Private Ryan, Flags Of Our Fathers and Dunkirk.Admittedly, The Eight Hundred doesn't have the emotion of Saving Private Ryan, the detail of Flags Of Our Fathers, or the cinematic intensity of Dunkirk. As a result, it isn't a masterpiece of war cinema, and it's fair to say that its opening act is a little slow to get moving.However, unlike so many big Chinese war epics of recent years that purely rely on big visual effects and constant action, The Eight Hundred is a really measured and well-made film.What it lacks in character depth it makes up for in a collective emotional strength, and although it may not showcase the darker side of the war in a way like City Of Life And Death, it's a really good combination of entertaining blockbuster action and worthy, powerful historical drama.A slow starter it may be, but The Eight Hundred is an undeniably impressive watch, and easily one of the best modern Chinese war movies. Epic despite its stationary location, emotional and inspiring despite some character weaknesses, and thoroughly exciting with great, measured action, it's a brilliant watch throughout."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I don't usually like chinese action movies because they are often idealistic, tone down and contain too many plot armours. This has taken me by surprise. A rare gem, movie about dramatized real events, with realistic tone and great cinematic actions. Such a rare type of movie at least for me, specifically on the realism. If you watch any east Asian movie, realism is simply rare. Moreover to see old China KMT flag on screen, such a surprise CCP let this movie be screened at all given its regulated censorship on anything that would make people question. China has gone a long way. After this I would love to watch more realistic and well produced chinese movie. Better than most hollywood movies, the movie triggers feelings such as awe in heroism, disgust in privilege differences, fear of death, joy from comic relief and satisfaction from learning history."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Egads, what a movie. I though the first hour and a half was some sort of military comedy-farce, with a dialog that was mostly NCOs yelling commands. It was also the overly long part to endear you to the characters, which of course, it didn't.The last hour actually had a story and if they focused on it throughout the movie might have been decent. But in the end it was melodramatic nationalism.Overall it is over written, over acted, over filmed and just way over done. Everyone was stereotyped, more stereotyped than a mid-20th Century Dr. Seuss book. And for some reason, it a lot of the movie was filmed with an eerie green lighting that you see in horror movie. I kept waiting for the Zombie Japanese soldiers to rise up and charge the warehouse.The final charge across the bridge scene is an example of the film's over-the-top-ness. The brave but hapless Chinese soldiers get mowed down by the Japanese but in the real battle only 10 or so Chinese soldiers were wounded on the bridge and their commander didn't die gloriously in the middle of the bridge recovering wounded; he was assassinated by the collaboration government a few years later while still interned by the Brits. The film makes you think the Chinese sacrificed this battalion, but in the entire fight the battalion suffered just 10 KIA and 37 wounded. But hey, #history..."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"It was disappointing to me. Not gritty enough. personally it was too over dramatic to me. also kind of meh character development. The characters were a little weak and the runtime was a bit too long. clearly the first hour was messed with, considering how jumbled it is - and the lack of flag close ups is another obvious thing. The scene where the soldiers strapped their bodies with grenades and jumped off the building was just ridiculous."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"Loved it! The colours, the scenes, the story, the way it makes you fell, the way it's directed. I got past the language early in the movie. Definitely recommend it!"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"This is one heck of a great film, absolutely mesmerizing, riveting from start to end.I have just come back from the Cinema in awe of its magnificence.Truly, it is a master piece.Wherever you look at, the movie delivers. Acting is incredible, cinematography, photography.It is technological superior, at the same time as artistically requisite and thought provoking.In addition it is historically accurate, enabling audiences world-wide to learn about an epic battle during WWII.The only missing thing is that Japanese atrocities were worst than the ones depicted in this movie.The Imperial Japanese Army unleashed the most brutal and savage attack on civilian population during the war, most infamously in nearby Nanjing.Indeed, ""The Rape of Nanking"" by Japanese soldiers is one of the most savage, criminal acts ever committed by military men on defenseless civilians.That same pattern of disregard for humanity was the norm for the Japanese invading forces, not only in China, but also in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Korea, Singapore, you name it.Horribly, Japan has never asked said sorry nor asked for forgiveness.Germany did. Japan have not.In fact, Japanese war criminals are revered and adored in Japan since the end of the war in 1945, and still they are are today, venerated in the infamous Yasukuni Shrine and the Chidorigafuchi CemeteryThat says it all.I think ""The Eight Hundred"" is a grand film, the product of a really commendable effort. Kudos to the producers, cast, and all involved in this truly memorable movie for the ages."

八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I thought this movie was fantastic the beauty of the filming the angles and the storyline really keeps you holding on this movie deserves a lot more credit than it gets I feel like, packed with action I would compare it to 1917 or Dunkirk."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"If we read history we can see that the Chinese army has never had heroes but had many deserters... the Chinese still cannot trust themselves and their government and therefore do not honorably fight. The Europeans too have suffered great damage due to the Japanese in Shanghai. The Chinese army has never had modern and scientific military talent nor study and for this reason it has always lost with all foreign countries and it will do so also in the future. A great paradigmatic example is the opium wars, lost against the British Empire."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"People who complain about yelling in this movie are uncultured and don't realize they are watching a ""Chinese"" war film. You know, the language that is mostly yelling and shouting. (Face palm)You need to know the history and culture before watching this movie.In China when people need to attract attention, make a point, or show authority, the most obvious way is to be loud. Ask any Chinese native.I thought this movie was fantastic coming from a country being ruled by the communist party, a country where nobody has freedom of speech. This movie was delayed a Year for political reasons And therefore I am amazed that the communist party even allowed this film to be released. Why? Because it symbolized the Chinese kuomintang which is a current enemy/rival of the CCP.Before world war 2 China was in a civil war. It was the Kuomintang vs the Communist party. And when Japan invaded China both the kuomintang and the Communist went into a ceasefire and joined together to fend off the Japanese invader. (Kuomintang soldiers wore German Uniforms, German Helmets,and copy's of German weapons. The communists wore uniforms imported mostly from Soviet Russia.After Japan lost the war the Chinese civil war resumed. Ultimately the CCP was victorious and the Kuomintang lost then fled to Taiwan. And today China threatens to invade Taiwan in overwhelming number. Totaly outnumbering Taiwan.I feel like this movie is for Taiwan more than anyone.Gotta bring up that moral somehow.For the People who say this is propaganda. Well it is. And so is every other war film you've ever seen in your life. Especially American War Films.For the people who think this movie is obscured from the truth. Well it is, and so are movies like saving private Ryan, fury, hacksawridge, band of brothers, the pacific, midway, ect, ect, ect, . For example If you wanna know how much of saving private Ryan is accurate? Guess what. It's only the first 5 minutes when they are sitting defenseless on the beach head. The rest of the movie is just inaccurate and over dramatic. I still love saving private Ryan but inaccuracy's are always forgivable. And these movies were also huge inspiration for The Eight Hundred.For the people who don't know how to make movies. Dont tell people who know how to make movies.. How to make movies.For the one comment who couldn't understand why they would risk they're lives for a flag...???? What the heck?. You probably never heard the song Star Spangled Banner and if you have. You obviously don't understand what that song is about. Americans understand dying for a flag.And finally for the people who say they have no idea who anybody is... Your not supposed too. It's not like you know who anyone is in Saving Private Ryan.Ultimately, The 800 is about 2 boys who are trying to escape war torn Shanghai but are unable, instead they find themselves merged with the 88th division.The 88th division has been tasked to hold the SiHung Warehouse to the death, this is to gain support from the western nations against the aggression of Japan. Right across the river from the SiHung Warehouse is the International settlement or the foreign concessions, so the battle took place in full view of Western Powers. The Japanese could not used naval artillary in the area because a stray shot could land in the concessions and set off a war with the west (japan did not want Great Britain or the United States to be engaged in war with them, yetThe outcome of the defense of SiHang warehouse resulted in 47 casualties for the Chinese 10 killed and 37 wounded. The true number of Chinese defenders was only 414 but the division ordered evacuated wounded men to tell the outside that there are 800 defenders in fear that if the Japanese knew their true number, they would attack more aggressively.(This was not shown in the movie)After the 88th division retreated. The British had to confiscate their weapons. And put them in internment camps located within the concessions. The 88th were allowed to keep their military routine Without weapons. After the attack on Pearl Harbor the Japanese invaded the concessions including the camp holding the 88th. They were taken prisoner and sent to Japanese POW camps for hard labor."

These soldiers were elite soldiers of the nationalist government trained and armed by Germany equipments at that time. The building in the movie is still there as an important witness for that history moment, counterpart of the World Trade Center. And these soldiers final destinies were rather pathetic, their extraction to the International Settlement district turned out to be like a prison since Japans occupied whole Shanghai and took them over, only around 100 survived out from initial 400ish when WWII was over..."

八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"1. Beginning of this movie was very good. It looks spend much money for make this movie. Movie was good and character building was very very good. Showing how was real war. It doesn't looks like heroic. It was horrible and dirty. This is how looks like a war. Short scenes how horrible was Japanese army at WWII. Few paragraphs telling Chinese army run away even they was almost 20 times greater than Japanese army. Actually it was true. This was real Chinese army face he he.2. History telling in this movie is totally lie. Copy of USA movie 300 just changed time and place. He he. How they fighting against Japanese army scenes was made very good. And the ending after few days fight they run heroically run away. He he. What a hell once they copied 300 Spartans they should've die. Oh by the way another one copy from USA war movie Our fathers Flag. One day before they running, they defended their flag at the rooftop and died some of them like hero. Even took down one Zero using German rifle. Suicide squad scene was great. I heard it before. Sometimes Chinese soldiers short of ammunition against Tank or machine-gun bunker they using ancient Chinese military tactic ""Human shield"". They running 1 one column protecting backward soldier who has C4 until reach the target and destroy it.3. What a hell. When the ending of the movie they telling Chinese army almost killed 70 percent of Japanese army in WWII. Then what USA army and Russia-Mongolian army done against Japanese. Actually Russia-Mongolian troops freed Inner Mongolia and after that Russian army freed China. At that time Chinese army was running, hiding in the mountain like a mouse. USA bombed Nagasaki and Hiroshima then Japanese surrendered.4. Ending was totally failure. It took from USA film ""I'm soldier"", looks like Mill Gibson and their troops attacking Vietnam soldiers. Running like heroes charging against outnumbered enemy army. But they was RUNNING like a hell. Their commander yelling SURVIVE EVERYBODY, RUN,I did not understand why that heroes should run when the movie ending? Real soldiers should run leaving their homeland? Once showing them like a heroes during 110 minute why they running last 20 minute. And showing their enemy their back is honorable like they said."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,One of the best war movies of all times. Yes it is. Also one of the best cinematic experiences of all time.
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"From the acclaimed filmmaker behind Mr. Six comes a riveting war epic, set during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, when eight hundred Chinese soldiers fight under siege from a warehouse in the middle of the Shanghai battlefield, completely surrounded by the Japanese army. Though from a filmmaking standpoint, Guan Hu directed and co-wrote the film, the film is in the right hands on this filmmaker. From the grander and well shot battle sequences to the quieter scenes, the cinematography and direction is phenomenal and seriously on point. But from a character standpoint and the more emotional moments, that's where the film fails as there are sadly too many characters to care about (but I'm sure the Chinese audience will have an easier time with caring and their knowledge of the actors, most who deliver good performances) so there's sadoy none to spare for the characters' emotional lives. Guan Hu focuses instead on the battle and the army instead of individual characters, it works, but I do wish it was more character driven. The writing was mostly good, just the characters who were lackluster. Though the events portrayed in the movie are realistic, the characters are not.The Eight Hundred is a war movie that tells a story based on true events, a story more people should know about. Visually, it's great and extremely memorable. With brilliant special and visual effects, terrific sound design and an impressive production and art design. The film is great. The tension and suspension is consistent, making the film always entertaining to watch, with gripping scenes and warfare sequences that will make your jaw drop. The musical score is gripping and superb. But the story has no real focus which makes the pacing a little bit lackluster, but the film does a great job portraying the defense of Sihang Warehouse in 1937 Shanghai by Chinese NRA troops during the Battle of Shanghai. The Eight Hundred is a war movie and never shines away from the horrors of war and the death that comes from a battle like this. Thus I would say this is a great war film, but honestly, not for everyone."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"@SnoopystylePlease allow me to correct, you said the Communist China allows the Nationalist Chinese Soldiers to be the hero, it is true they cannot manipulate the history during WW2 it is the Nationalist Army under Generalisimo Chiang Kai-Shek who is in command and the Col. Xie even said that and they used Nazi German weapons and helmets is true as that time the Germans have help the Nationalist Army by providing weapons and training, the Communist gain power in 10/1/1949 yet so the director has no choice but to portray the Nationalist as the army who resisted the Japs, they did not let the audience see clearly the flag when it was unfolded and shown to the men, the when it was raised the cameramen focus on the soldiers but the Nationalist Anthym was played this is my reply to hou"

八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I expected much more of this movie. I can't say i did not enjoy it, but some parts have been too short and some were too long. The cast was lacking someone to take you through this adventure. The deserters were unlikeable since the beginning but the focus was on them for the most part. I would have loved to learn more about the unit itself and where they are coming from. The commander could have been an amazing lead and he does get some lines but also is more a side-character like almost everyone in the movie. The action es good, but not intense like ""300"" or ""Brotherhood"" or ""James Ryan"". We learn a lot of of stories but it was all surface level stuff.After all there was so much great dramatic moments so I think it does work as a good Anti-War movie. I would even recommend it if only they hadn't it stylized in this terrible green fog all the time. It makes it look dishonest and fake where it should have been raw and dirty. This coloring ruined the impact of many scenes. You either go all in on this look and do a 300-style CGI-art project or you go for purist realism like 1918.I think they tried to appeal to a broader audience with their style and character choices but I also feel the backstory of this movie, and importance of the subject, deserved a more focused direction and tone.It's good, not ""great""."

Certainly a pretty movie - if war and death can be called pretty.Lots and lots (lots!) of CGI.But, and there sure is a 'but', the story, the narrative, the characters - all very, very, I wanna say ordinary, but cliched and dumb would be more accurate.2½ hours of people killing each other, spectaculary, for sure, but it's 2½ hours of people killing each other - and nothing much else.If that's your bag, well, then by all means; Go for it.If story, narrative and half-way developed characters is more your thing; Avoid at all cost."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"First of all congrats to the comrades of the communistic party who seemed to opens the treasury for a really great two and a half hour propaganda movie that can compete easily with Hollywood. Scene and technic are awesome. Target is clear: showing of some important Chinese recent historic moments with some cultural information. Liked but but you have to know the purpose, like Hollywood always did."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I pay my respects to the cast and crew who made this film. This film was able to make me sit watching from beginning to end.... The actors were able to make this film VERY ALIVE, and made me cry 4 times (until my husband was shocked)...This film deserves high appreciation and appreciation. BRAVO! - HIGHLY RECOMENDED for your WATCHLIST!!"
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"It was so green that I thought my tv or internet had problem. It made me feel like everything was from green screen (graphics).While watching the movie, I kept thinking why do ppl across the river/bridge just look at the war? Don't they care about safety? Don't they want to help their country?The flag - while it was patriotic, it was silly to die just to hold the flag in OPEN AREA! Can't they get some shield or put the flag somewhere else? Same goes for suicide line (Japanese had these too but not in this movie).Brave soldiers, some light hearted moments, some tense and exciting moments but acting + editing were a bit choppy."
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,Like literally all 2hrs. Was just spent forcing Chinese to fight dor their own. They could have fought at the first place but deserted their post. And then on and on. Was just forcing them to fight.
八佰,The Eight Hundred (2020),,2020,2020.08.28,"I really loved this film. Don't listen to the other reviewers calling it a bad film due to it being propaganda, over-shouty and over-dramatic. It gives a mediocre representation of history showing realistic fighting from both sides without over-dramatic main character epic fighting so I don't understand over-dramatic. Over-shouty? Its war and plus when they are not in war they are not shouting... Lol. Propaganda... Seriously? Like most war movie films then? This film almost had trouble releasing due to it showing Kuomingtang courage as well as cowardice. It's very interesting to see for its content and the actual political background of the movie in China. I took off one star because it didn't release some potential scenes that should've been there!PS: It originally had an interesting scene which was cut."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Could be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"If this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,One of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"When this was reported in my area I remember thinking, oh, that's tragic and went on without realizing just how extraordinary and difficult it was to get these kids out. Thanks to everyone carrying a camera these days, the footage looks as if the events were actually filmed but they weren't. Despite much of the firm being re-enactments, it's so seamless there are times when I was thinking why are they filming this. I've seen climbing movies where they're pretty successful at this but considering the staging and people involved and the technical aspect of the film processing, it's really hard to tell watching this, what is 'real' and what's not, so even though you may remember the result, you probably didn't know the facts. It's a credit to Saman Kunan and Beirut Pakbara who subsequently died during and after the mission. They will forever be eulogized, along with all the men and women who unselfishly donated themselves to saving these children."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Even if you know how the film will end, Jimmy Chin manages to make the film as gripping as possible. His factual report on the rescue of the football team trapped in the Tham Luang cave system in the summer of 2018 is quite annoying thanks to the gripping compilation of re-enacted scenes that were shot during the rescue - a small masterpiece about true heroes."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,I HAVE NEVER CLAPPED AT THE END OF A MOVIE BEFORE. ESPECIALLY AT HOME BY MYSELF. BUT HERE I WAS. WITH TEARS STREAMING DOWN MY FACE AND QUIETLY CLAPPING AT THE MIRCLE I JUST WITNESSED.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I am a foreigner living in Thailand so the events at the cave in 2018 were fairly close to home for me personally.At the time this rescue was happening, I was aware that the Thai authorities were not always cooperative with the scruffy ""falangs"" (a very derogatory term used in Thailand for foreigners) who showed up to try to save the boys in the cave along with the one adult who was with them. But, this documentary attempted somewhat to make plain the extent to which the Thai authorities actually hindered the foreigners after their own Thai Navy SEALS failed. I guess the situation might have been worse than was shown in this documentary but that the producers felt that they had to tone down the truth a bit.This documentary makes it clear, for example, that the foreign divers were, at various times, forbidden to do, and were otherwise obstructed in doing, what they came to Thailand to do. That is, to rescue the 13 individuals who were trapped in the cave. And all this entirely at their own risk of injury or possible death. It's barely credible that the Thais evidently said that if any of the 13 died in the rescue attempt, then the foreigners might be prosecuted under Thai law, I guess for ""manslaughter"" or whatever they might call that. The truth is that if these incredible people had not flown in from all over the western world at huge personal risk, it is quite certain that all 13 would have been left to die. I'm afraid that this is in fact fairly typical of the way foreigners are generally treated in Thailand.The guys who made the incredible rescue in this instance were truly heroic and I am glad the documentary made that clear."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Two directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Beautifully pieced everything together to told story of those brave people who helped in rescue. Must watch, especially with family or kids to give them a great lesson of generosity, kindness, being helpful."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"My Review- The Rescue ( Streaming on Disney)My Rating 10+ /10The Rescue tells the story of the miraculous rescue of the twelve Thai boys and their football coach from what seemed certain death as they remained trapped in underground caves in a Thailand mountain range for over two weeks.After a birthday party the boys of the Wild Boars football team continued their celebrations after football practice and cycled up into the forested hills of the mountain range towering over Mae Sai to their favourite exploration destination .The area near the caves had been recently blanketed with torrential rain when the boys parked their bikes and bags and in high spirits entered the caves not to be seen again till their rescue over a fortnight later.They had often been to Tham Luang before and had ventured deep inside the caves carving the initials of new team members as part of an initiation ceremony.However this time due to early monsoon rains the 10km underground Tham Luang cave system that separates Thailand and Myanmar quickly flooded with water and the boys and their coach were trapped and helpless.The Documentary that features factual and some re-enacted spectator footage I found incredibly emotional as the hopelessness at what clearly seemed an inevitable tragedy proceeded to unfold then the events took on a Spiritual aspect that doesn't seem to have been reported as much as the rescue itself.The indomitable Faith of the Thai parents and rescuers even in the face of the rescue turning into a body recovery operation stands out as importantly as the science and technology used by the rescue heroes that included skilled Thai Navy Seal divers , US air force rescue specialists, and cave divers from the UK, Belgium, Australia, Scandinavia, and many other countries.This documentary is as much about Faith whatever your belief or non belief is.Its certainly about the bravery and skills of the divers that included British divers John Volanthen who was the first voice the boys and their coach heard after nine days trapped underground.He and fellow British divers Rick Stanton and Chris Jewell were called in by Thai authorities, along with another British caving expert, Robert Harper.They were joined by the 2019 Australians of the Year. Dr Richard ""Harry"" Harris and Dr Craig Challen who were honoured for their ""heroic efforts"" as part of the rescue operation.The Thai people have always impressed me with their warmth , gentleness and strong sense of faith . That unshakable faith is made very obvious in the film after the trapped boys are discovered and given food plus the bracelets blessed by a Buddhist monk that their families had to convince the Western divers were just as necessary for survival as food. The starving and cold boys and their Coach weren't panicking when finally discovered in fact their smiles and gratitude bought tears to my eyes .It was more than an eerie coincidence that the revered Shan Buddhist monk who had blessed the bracelets Phra Khuva Boonchum from northern Thailand predicted at the rescue site that the boys were all alive and that 2 lives involved in their rescue would be lost which was the ultimate outcome of this miraculous rescue .Most documentaries when the outcome is well known are of course interesting but I have never seen a better example of Faith virtually moving mountains.The upcoming feature movie by Ron Howard titled Thirteen Lives starring Colin Farrell as John Volanthen Joel Edgerton as Harry Evans Viggo Mortensen as Rick Stanton should be interesting but surely couldn't move me as much as this fine documentary.Why can't I find anyone in the cast list to play Dr Craig Challen who was so integral to the rescue ,perhaps he declined to be portrayed in the film?This fine cinematic document surely should win next years Oscar I hope so."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Really got me sucked into the story. It was tense and heartwrenching. Not overplayed, and well paced. It does sometimes try a little too hard to be suspencefull, but I'll allow it. All in all, pretty amazing.8/10: great."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Utterly amazing to see thousands of people come together, from all over the planet, with the singular goal of rescuing these children. The incredible risks taken, the financial and personal concerns were no deterrent to these brave and generous people. In today's vile climate of hate and discontent we live in, to see this true story played out is a reminder that decency and compassion do exist, and that when called upon, good people will act together.Even though we know ""how it ends,"" the suspense was truly edge-of-your-seat. The emotion was powerful, seeing--- and feeling--- the defeat and discouragement, the triumph and the joy.Okay... maybe I was crying. But you are too."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The Rescue embodies the very element that is needed in the World right now, when every country works together to accomplish a single goal, beautiful things will happen. The sheer determination and heroism of the group of divers is the driving emotional force of the film, and so unlike many other documentaries, the film is not carried by fascination nor discovery, but more so on the development of human emotions. The topic was also such a big deal at the time that it is easy for audience to be captivated by it."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The Rescue is a new documentary directed by Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi.The film tells the story of the difficult rescue mission of the twelve Thai football players who, along with their coach, became trapped in the Thai caves. Because Thailand was unable to find and then rescue the boys on its own, they turn to the rest of the world for help. For example, the two middle-aged English men Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, who cave diving as a sport and hobby, know how to offer the necessary help. The two have the right experience and homemade equipment for the quest. When they finally manage to find the missing boys and share the news with the rest of the world, the entire rescue team is faced with the real mission: to free the boys from the kilometers long and deep caves. They have to come up with the right plan for this, which they don't have long for, because nature works against them due to the rising water level and the loss of oxygen in the caves.Using news and local footage from the rescue team and later filmed footage from the divers, the directors are able to tell clearly how the event went. With animation images added later to show what the roads in and out of the caves looked like, they show how difficult this rescue mission has been.Despite the fact that the outcome of the rescue mission is already known to the world, they still manage to show how tough and hopeless this rescue mission has been. The documentary also highlights how heavy and weakened humanity can be when pitted against nature. Where rainy streams and against rushing water forces oppose humanity.The documentary also shows how the ego of man can work against humanity itself, because after finding the missing boys, everyone tried to take credit to come up with the right rescue plan. For example, some forgot the well-being of the victims only to emerge as the hero out of self-interest. They also show how the difference of religion and culture can sometimes work against humanity.With interviews of different people from the rescue team, you as a viewer also get more background information about who the members of the team were and what their role has been. Most of this information is interesting, but other background information can seem a bit unnecessary and should not have been included in the final documentary."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"An absolute must-see even if you know nothing about cave diving, or scuba diving in general. This is an exceptional story that illustrates how even ordinary people can rise up to the occasion and achieve extraordinary things. Never give up."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Nobody in Thailand will forget the moving and heartbreaking events that occurred around the 'football boys' that got trapped in a cave in the north. The whole world thought and acted and sent out ideas and specialists to get them out, which fortunately was achieved. An earlier attempt at showing it, The Cave, was in my view a bad try, as it only showed the newsreels and had poor cinematography. This docufilm is a very welcome and great improvement. Through actual footage and re-enacted scenes, with additional studio work, we get a very good insight not only in the events but also on the impact it had on the boys, their families and the professionals dealing with this almost impossible situation. An absolute must to see for all who followed this drama."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Firstly. How on earth did this not even get a Oscar nomination? A true story told with depth and heart. In parts I was watching and gasping for air myself. Full of suspense it really puts you down on the ground with the people at the time. But most of all it really shows the heart and love of the human spirit these men showed. Fantastically captured by Jimmy Chin.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"OMG, this is magical, an Odyssey of Bravery, love and the best of the human beings. One of the best documentaries ever made. Those young boys are exceptional as the people who rescued them."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Riviting, and oh so human. The young boys who toughed it out. And the middle aged kinda goofy Englishmen cave divers did the human thing and came the the rescue. Heros for sure."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Amazing documentary about the power of Unity! The amount of people that gathered around with the some purpose, to save those kids, it's uplifting and give us faith in the humankind.At the same time it made me wonder... why don't we always act like that, with empathy and generosity to others?Congratulations to all the heroes that made this miracle come true! And I hope the kids are fine and healthy. So good to see the families so happy and reunited with their sons :)"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Excellent documentary. The story narration, excellent editing. It's an 18 day huge rescue mission cutdown into less than 2 hr documentary covering all the key elements, highs and lows of the mission. Explained What make it the top 1 rescue missions of all time can be seen, engineers aspect, medical aspect, skills aspect, nature aspect, devotional aspect, military aspect, time sensitivity and so on."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Every once in a while, a story/movie comes along that restores your faith in humanity. Searching for Sugarman, etc. This is one of them.Maybe it was just me, but I had no idea of what had really gone on in Thailand. All I'd heard is that kids were trapped, and that they were eventually rescued. Details were sorely lacking.If the story of two complete strangers (eventually quite a few more) with a rare passion and skill set traveling across the world to not only find, but rescue these lads doesn't gladden your heart... Well, I feel sorry for you.As to the movie itself; it's even-handed, fair, well-edited, well-scripted, and overall excellently produced. It's also fascinating and entertaining. My only criticism is that it's a tad long. But it is a documentary and there's the need to present all the facts.The best couple of hours I've spend watching in quite a while."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Went into this relatively blind as I'd somehow missed the media storm covering this rescue when it happened back in 2018, so i had no idea if everyone survived or if there were issues with the rescue - or even how exactly they did it.I must say I was absolutely blown away with the rescue itself. I couldn't look away for the last half of the movie. The tension was unbearable and I was just hoping and praying that everything went okay. I was so relived once that last kid got out and was safe.The film was very well put together and the pacing was perfect. It didn't gloss over any of the details and wasn't shy to show the positives and negatives of the rescue operation. To be able to portray to someone who didn't really know what happened, how incredibly daring and insane the entire event was, really shows how good this is. It did well to really throw you into the situation - you could really sense the tension and desperation that every person on-site would have been experiencing. You were willing them along just as much as they would have been on the day.I feel like the amount of real footage used helped deliver this. Most of it was footage from the actual rescue - no obvious recreations or fakery for the most part. You're in that cave with them. You can really feel how claustrophobic that cave system is - and just how incredibly difficult it would have been to get from A to B.This is an absolute must watch. Nothing more to say.(P. S: If you can find someone who didn't really know about the rescue like me, get them to watch this. It'll be one hell of an experience for them!)"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"As recreational divers ourselves, my wife and I were on the edge the whole movie. It was such an audacious plan and pure luck that it worked in this case, but what a harrowing story!I hope that others watching realize how absolutely insane what these men and women did to save the soccer team. Wow!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The 10/10 - why, because it showed a how much of a struggle it was going to be to get those boys out. Even if you knew the outcome its still very riveting and emotional. Helped to put a lot into perspective.From across the world we only got to hear and see what the media reported. It was nice to hear the thoughts and feelings from several of the main people involved."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Even though we know the rescue was successful, what we saw on the news in June 2018 was only about 20% of the story. This doc either had me on the edge of my seat or was tugging at my emotions, back and forth. The rescue involved hundreds of people from around the world, and it was only due to a a few experienced 'weekend' cave divers and an Australian anaesthesiologist that the rescue was possible - literally against all odds.The doc also shows the tremendous efforts going on outside the cave and further up the mountain to pump out millions of litres of water daily from the almost daily early monsoon rain, the engineering efforts by hundreds of soldiers from many countries just inside the cave entrance to allow easy access/egress for the divers and to carry the boys the final distance to safety, and the difficult decisions made by Thai officials. Filmmakers included visual graphics at times to show the long length of the cave, and where the divers were at specific points.There must have been divine intervention too - and the doc shows this possibility, including telling the Thai legend of the origin of the mountain Doi Nang Non. The cave, Tham Luang Nang Non, means ""the cave of the reclining lady""."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Very touching retelling of the rescue of the 13 in the cave. Hard to believe the story, this doco covers the events incredibly well whilst respecting the navy seal that tragically lost his life.Would recommend to all doco lovers."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,It is almost miraculous that this rescue was successful. So many things could have gone wrong. The documentary tells the story well. Most of the underwater scenes had to be reenacted but that doesn't detract from the storytelling. In reality the water was much murkier. How these divers accomplished what they did in these conditions is almost beyond belief.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"When people land on the moon, they can also rely on maps. But in those caves full of unknowns, no one knows where the road will lead, no one knows what will happen at the next corner."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Kruba Boonchum, a famous monk, visited the cave where the 13 soccer kids and coach were trapped and assured the public that the kids were alive, but to expect 2 deaths from this rescue. His clairvoyant sight was accurate. We don't know if the rescue team were aware of what Boonchum had said. If they did, it would have made everyone that much more fearful during the whole rescue. In predictions, outcomes can change if you take a different path, especially when you are aware of a future possibility. The not knowing who would fall victim and when is the scary part. This film, with the help of animated images really had me on the edge of my seat, what was going to happen next. Prayers to everyone who volunteered, the kids, and their coach."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,What a touching documentary. By far the best one I've seen.Such brave men who helped save these trapped souls. Very sad that one man died.This is how humans are meant to be. Coming together in unity to do what's right for each other! Instead of fighting in wars.It is heart warming to see that they all survived. Miraculous.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Why are there not 50% female rescuers in this production??? This is blatant sex harassment + discrimination . Cancel all the actors and producers involved in this rescue. Cancel all men ;))))
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I had this incident in my subconscious , hearing about it in news 4 years back but after watching this documentary I got to know about how this happened and what it took to rescue those 13 boys from that cave, I was in tears for most part, I had to pause every now and then , gather myself and then watch again , this wasn't a Rescue, it was a pure MIRACLE nothing else a MIRACLE!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This documentary left me on the edge of my seat when I watched it. Seeing the rescuers of the children and the real footage of the rescue as it occurred added to the urgency and the intensity of the film. At times I wondered if they were going to die or not during the rescue as there were so many risks involved. No documentary that I have seen has been this intense, heroic and raw, and I highly recommend that you see it. 10/10."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,". . . in the ground, particularly when monsoon rains fill them up with water for eight months, as happened just after THE RESCUE. But even if you're scuttling along alone, half-submerged in an underground ditch toward the outer edge of Fiborn Quarry, and the back of your sweatshirt gets snagged on a jagged rock underwater when you have just a few inches of breathing room above, you might quickly realize that you're on your own getting out of your predicament because hunting season is five months away and nobody will happen along to stumble across your remains AT LEAST until then. Conversely, you might be high and dry on Horseshoe Mesa on the abandoned Grandview Trail within the Grand Canyon when cave scat spooks your little sister, forcing you to chunk rocks at her legs to motivate her to climb back up to the East Rim. (Perhaps it's the ounces sweat away there that allow a safe escape from another tight spot hidden deep within a semi-wild King's Canyon cavern a few days later.) And probably it's best NOT to encourage your spouse to squeeze through that drain tile they keep on hand at the Wind Cave Visitor Center."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I don't think I have ever said ""good Lord"" so often. Watch this, just watch this. Heroes every one of them. The best in human spirit overcoming insurmountable odds."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The Rescue is a gripping documentary film covering the extraordinary events of June/July 2018 at the Tham Luang caves in the Chiang Ria region of northern Thailand. Twelve boys aged 11 to 15 from a local soccer team decided to explore the famous local cave network after training but earlier than expected monsoon rains flooded the entrance trapping the boys in a cave about a mile deep into the intricate web of tunnels and caves.The retrieval of these boys (and their 25 year old coach) became the subject of a massive global rescue operation closely covered by international media. The unique challenges of navigating now underwater caves and tunnels defeated the best efforts of first the Thai, then even US, Navy Seals and, as the days tick by, hope of rescuing the boys fades. Coincidentally a British cave diver called Vern Unsworth, resident in Chiang Rai, is called in to assess the difficult and complex challenge and recommends the Thai authorities call on the expertise of the world's top cave divers, two unassuming middle aged Englishmen Richard Stanton and John Volanthon who are flown out to Thailand and manage to penetrate through to the cave chamber where they find the boys gaunt and cold but alive and hopeful.The movie follows the brainstorming of various plans to extract the boys. There are massive seemingly insurmountable hurdles, the incessant heavy rain, the myriad of tight water filled passages, the surging currents and murky water, the sheer distance underwater to get to the actual cave and the mind boggling logistics of retrieving them alive. Richard and John reach out to 10 other top cave divers in the tight global fraternity of men who had for years navigated the dark wet solo world of cave diving. Crucial to the operation is the presence of Australian caving diving anesthetist (anesthesiologist) Richard Harris who instructs the divers as to how to administer specific doses of anesthetic drugs to put the boys to sleep during the extraction to ensure they remain calm through the tight passages. Behind the divers was an army of 10,000 personnel including engineers and hydrologists who instructed on an elaborate system of diversions and pumps to counteract the impact of the constant heavy rain to drillers and diggers who create an extraction channel in the first cave to shorten the distance.Whilst the success of the operation is known before you view the film, nonetheless the story is as gripping and compelling as any you will see as the directors skillfully splice interviews with the key participants with actual news footage at the time to painstakingly tell the whole story of the enormous and complex operation.Directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Vasarhelyi capture the entirety of emotions from the constant doubts of the expert cave divers and the apprehension of Dr Harris plunging into an unknown and untried drug regimen. First the fears of the emotional parents then their unimaginable elation at the emergence of their sons alive and well, are all beautifully captured as is the sadness of the loss of a retired Thai Seal and the way the nation of Thailand honored his death. This miraculous rescue is unique and you find yourself cheering with the mass of volunteers as the first of the boys is put into an ambulance, thin and malnourished after 18 days with little more than water, but alive and crying with the joyful parents and the bereaved widow of the Thai diver. This is one of finest of this genre of documentaries you'll ever see."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This was an incredible true story which was incredibly well put together. It's moments like these that makes you proud of humanity. Amazing documentary, great people overcoming impossible situations."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Great documentary about real heroes performing an amazing rescue. A tense watch if you're claustrophobic. It uses a lot of real footage and some good CGI to make it clear just how hard of a rescue this was and how low a chance of success they had despite thousands of people being involved.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I read Dr Harris' book in 2 days and watched this the second I heard it was released. What an amazing group of humans. What an uplifting, exhilarating experience. I was in the journey with them the whole way though. I cried like a baby because I felt their fear and doubt amongst all the odds and risk. What a story!! So we'll told!! Well done!!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Did the UK proud with that one. Everyone involved worked so hard. Its amazing they managed to get all the children out alive. Have to have respect for the divers who took on that Herculean feat. The caves themselves are quite fascinating, they warrant a documentary all of their own. Hopefully thats an end to school trips, or what ever they were doing in there in the first place."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I was hesitant to watch this, but I'm glad I did. The actual rescuers and other people were in it, and we learn so much that was never mentioned at the time.I am very claustrophobic, so I didn't think I could watch, but there was one brief part where I had to close my eyes. The rescuers, who were from several countries, shared their thoughts, fears, and reactions, which was incredibly interesting and touching.Well worth watching!!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I followed this story on the news but never knew exactly what all went into the rescue. Incredible world effort that needs to inspire, especially in this day and age. This documentary is gripping, moving and inspiring. Highly Recommended!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Fresh off their world conquering and Oscar winning doco Free Solo, directing duo and real life couple Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi return to the documentary space with their thrilling exploration of the captivating true life tale of the Thailand cave rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach that had the whole world watching in 2018.Coming a year before Ron Howard's Australian shot feature film of this event with Joel Edgerton and Colin Farrell hits the big screens, The Rescue is the most gripping and quintessential look at this unbelievable true life event yet, let down only by a mixture of recreated scenes that are filmed so well, the difference between what is ""real"" footage from the actual time and place and what has been faithfully reshot by the duo and the real life people of the rescue is hard to distinguish making you unsure about how too feel about what you are at times seeing.Focused mainly on the lifesaving diving duo of Brits John Volanthen and Rick Stanton, who received help for their daring rescue plan from Australian doctor/diver Richard Harris, Chin and Vasarhelyi find some larger than life figures to walk us through the events leading up to the eventual safe return of the lost boys and their coach with the central duo making for likable and fascinating narrators of the events that were taking place in 2018 as the whole world watched on.Bringing home just how dangerous and complicated the rescue mission of the 13 souls was, The Rescue does a great job of allowing those who had boots on the muddy ground to tell the story and relay their thoughts, feelings and experiences back to us, giving us as close to a first hand experience as we would ever care to have of the occurrence in the unforgiving and unrelenting cave system.The problem with this experience is the aforementioned trouble discerning what is genuine captured footage and what is the more Hollywoodized version of events that Chin and Vasarhelyi shot in stages usually reserved for big budget event films, there's nothing wrong with documentaries recreating certain events to add context and a visual guide but it would've been a great move for the film to make it more apparent as you can't help but feel slightly manipulated by a film that never appears to be showing its true hand.Final Say -A fascinating subject matter makes for a thrilling if slightly manipulative documentary, The Rescue is proficiently made and put together and now lays down the gauntlet for Ron Howard to try and beat with his upcoming feature film.3 1/2 foil blankets out of 5."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Super documentary. Unfortunately it forgot to mention the other international divers, helping out. Yes, they mentioned other internationals, partitioning in the cave, but those weren't divers.I believe there were 19 divers total, besides the Navy Seal divers.But I'm also glad, they left out the Elon Musk idiocy. It had no place in this documentary."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Well, to keep it short: The Rescue holds up to expectations, holds up to the great ratings overall and is just incredbily well made. You don't need any insights in how this made, how footage was gained etc. (compare: Free Solo, which really relied on this) because the story is just so gripping, you don't really get to think about other things.The main characters are all smypathetic in their ways, their are all authentic and this is what makes the viewer feel comfortable. All actions, all ideas and plans are reproducible through this. In addition, the film isn't overlong and it's not in the directors will to be overly emotional. You'll cry if you need to do so and you won't if you don't have to - the story will leave its marks anyways.There is also no overly high praising for these people, the film is not a ""western"" take on what happended in that cave and that town, it's just a deeply realisitic approach. All people who worked there, everybody, together as humans, no matter which nationality, which skin color, which religion, all are heroes, united as human beings - and I'm very thankful for Chin and Vasarhelyi for producing this great documentary."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,For such an amazing cause . The planning and precision of the rescue plan was amazing to witness.Shows one... behind all the craziness going on in this world ...you have the chance to appreciate the good in this world.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"A nightmare situation which is made bearable to watch because of the testimony of various key individuals most notably the British cave divers whose expertise was initially snubbed by the local authorities. By 2nd July 2018 the lads hadn't eaten for 10 days. Whilst there was widespread relief about finding them alive, the divers were almost at a loss as to how they could be rescued. With hindsight we all know what happened but the film still makes for a gripping experience. Full of technical challenges and political hassles. The film has high production standards by the same team as ""Free Solo"". It hints at the faith and prayers of family members (not to mention millions of others around the world) which were so wonderfully answered."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"There is faith in humanity. When we are united, nothing is impossible.Everyone has a purpose, thank you to the brave and generous heros who rescued these boys."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Forget about all the other movies that are made about this story, THIS very movie is the best portrayal of what happened. Period.The good: this is one of those few documentaries that made me fight the tears of joy and relief at the end. What a story. What a bravery. What a perseverance. What a positivity and generousity worldwide to help save these kids.Even if you know the entire story it is still recommended to watch it, because we get to see (and understand) in detail about all the excruciatingly difficult circumstances under which these divers had to rescue these kids.It is mostly told from the viewpoint of these few nerdy cavedivers from England, who just happened to be special at something which suddenly could save lives.All these English cave divers openly admitted on camera they were actual nerds, who never really got along socially in their teenage years, but while they lacked in social skills, they did excell magnificently in staying cool, calm and collected under intense pressure and danger. What a heroes. BRAVO!Highly recommended!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Firstly, a LOT of the 10 star reviews here are shilled you can tell by accounts whose sole review activity on IMDB is to give this film a 10.Secondly this film is mostly melodrama, not drama. It also microfocuses on the cave divers when there was a huge international response. A construction equipment firm I used to work for brought in generators and special cameras from halfway across the globe and they and others get no notice in this film.Mainly the problem is the film is, well, cheesy, to the point of being cringeworthy with the dialogue, scripting, music etc. And some really bad effects. I felt like I was watching Poseidon adventure or Towering inferno."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,A very captivating story kept me on my edge even though I had watched some documentaries of this rescue on YouTube. You learn something new from each documentary you watch about this rescue.I can't wait to see how Netflix's miniseries about this will go.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,This documentary was probably one the most amazing things I have ever watched and I will recommend it to all of my friends. It is such a unique story about a heroic and seemingly impossible task made possible when people come together. It will make you feel better about the world we live in and how there are real life heroes that you should know about and celebrate. I will recommend this to all my friends and people I know.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Like everyone else I saw this in the news. But this really brought it home. Amazing and incredibly moving if your looking for a reason why the world is better as one then this is it.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,What a truely inspiring story of the good of mankind. All coming together despite differences for the innocent future of our world. Capturing true emotions as you embark on a journey with the crew.PS- I never doubted Xanax and Ketamine!
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Stunning retelling of Thai cave rescue from the perspective of specialist cave divers. I've seen a few negative reviews from users saying this films shows nothing new or doesn't show the broader picture. The talking head footage and gathered original film footage augmented with fantastic graphical representations of the cave network serve to make a truly stunning, edge of your seat documentary. The logistical effort and leaps of faith on show here are one thing but the sheer bravery exhibited by a small group of social misfits with a peculiar weekend hobby is quite staggering. With the possible threat of serious legal consequences and with zero financial motivation, these men negotiated politics and heroic navy seal machismo in addition to 4 km of subterranean, sub aquatic zero visibility hell multiple times to rescue 13 complete strangers. Stunning film about true heroism and a peculiar but impressive skill set.Watch in awe!!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This documentary really is superb, it reallys sends a message about not giving up when the odds are stacked against you.So many involved in the rescue had their doubts yet through determination they managed to pull off an amazing rescueLoved it."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"An almost unbelievable, incredible set of circumstances. I was riveted right at the start all the way through to the end. There's so many heart stopping moments, I was drained by the end even though I knew the general story."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Remarkable triumph of at team of individuals who achieved an impossible feat!True journey of determination, courage and sacrifice was documented brilliantly for audience to see from the ground level.Never seen footage of actual events.It's surprising to how much good we could do as man kind when we actually put our resources and skill on achieving one common task.We can't ask for more.Well done the production team and the National Geographic for taking us back in to the cave where we wonder for years what really happened."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,I liked the 3D animation of the documentary. It should have more of it because it will give a better idea of what was going on. It feels like there are missing events.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This documentary is way too long and loaded with needless side notes and stories. I'm not sure how anyone could give this a 10. I understand the heart felt reason to, but this documentary is far from perfect. You can tell this was only supposed to be an hour long but someone thought it would be a great Idea to load this up with tons of unnecessary babble to draw it out to 1 hour and 45 minutes."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The movie was slightly disjointed for me in terms of the way it presented the sequence of events and plot, but overall was well-made. Wasn't as dramatic as it could've been as I already knew the end result, but that's not the fault of the movie itself."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This inspirational story was international news in 2018 and had a happy ending. The plan and general information was public. There are so many incredible details that most don't know about this rescue. If you like to see ""how things work"" and the specifics of a situation, WATCH THIS DOCU-MOVIE. *there are some subtitles but it's less than 15%"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I have never been able to dive a cave becasuce the cave itself scary enough. For most people it is unnecessary sport etc. But to being in caves is an extraordinary feeling. While I was watching the documentary and the movie I felt very complicated. It could be me. I felt the cave divers problems. It is so emotional for me. Every decision they make is extraordinary. In 2018 I heart the float from the chain of caves communication. And in first 3 seconds without any hesitation, I said they were all dead. Because the situation is completely imposible. The minor incidents are results dead very easily. I can estimate the conditions and my result is not like this. This is impossible. Not only for caves but also for navy, volunteers etc."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,This movie is amazing. Even knowing the outcome I was totally mesmerized! My only criticism is that the re-enacted scenes should have clearly labeled. There is no disclosure about re-enactments until the ending credits.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Great documentary. A life lesson in learning to overcome the unknowns, to truly believe in yourself and what you can accomplish. Keep calm and never give up."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,This really is a fantastic documentary with the whole in-depth story of what we all saw on the news. I've probably watched this documentary three times because it really does amaze me what happened and the outcome. It's an emotional story with real life heroes that I highly recommend watching.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Think you know the story? Well you DON'T!! This would be the closet thing to impossible and miracle that you will ever witness!It left me absolutely breathless in disbelief that the only option they had was body bags. Overcoming every single obstacle that was against them is just too much to even comprehend.. To hear the story but then learn about the nature of this rescue left me lost for words and sleepless! The sheer impossibility of this was to say the least and until to see this you will never believe the word impossible again... the most amazing story and documentary I've ever seen!!!
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"I remember seeing this story in the news few years ago, but watching it now it was tense and suspenseful I realised just how brave all the volunteers involved were.An amazing film would definitely recommend well worth watching."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This is one of the best documentary I have watched so far in this year. As rest of the world, we prayed for those children & coach. But we never had any idea how a private group of people who dive as a hobby risked their lives save 13 lives. This documentary will take you a journey to that cave where you will feel like that you're a diver yourself.Highly recommended to everyone! Believe me you will end up crying.Finally I want to say Thank you all (private group of divers, SEAL members & other volunteers) for saving those children & coach. You sirs, did an amazing job. Whole world, including me, bend on our knees to show our respect. Thank you!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Even knowing the outcome I was on the edge of my seat watching this. Such incredible bravery and resilience of all involved. Incredible documentary while I followed this on the news at the time, watching this documentary gave me a much better insight to the magnitude of the rescue and the dangers to the diving and the rescue mission. Hard to believe it's a true story."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Ruddy hell fire! As an avid documentary fan, I was eager to watch 'The Rescue' and must say, it is utterly enthralling, saddening and spiritually uplifting in equal measure. Having been born with a royal spoon up my backside, I have become terribly lazy, yet after watching this masterpiece, I gave my butler the night off and allowed him to turn the heating on in his quarters. All in all, an inspiring documentary that above all else, highlights the fact that we are all one. Super!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"One of the best documentary i have ever seen, full of interesting events. I have never a group of people so brave helping others selflessly, it is quite a experience and feeling you get your self while watching this amazing documentry."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"If it wasn't for that horribly cheesy song at the end, this was an incredible documentary of an incredible story! It still gets a solid 10. The combination of this and Ron Howard's film packs a real one-two punch!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,I remember following the media coverage about this back in 2018 and wondering what made it such a difficult operation - watch this and you'll understand exactly why and what it took to achieve the results these real-life heroes did. Mad respect. Brilliant document.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Superb direction. An adventerous & emotional ride through world's best rescue operation. Don't miss it. I will say the Best movie of the year. Best documentry so far about a rescue mission.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,Was sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. Very inspring story and well put together. Maybe I was sweating less then Jimmy Chin's previous documentarys but the Rescue touched me more emotionally then Meru and Free Solo. Only thing was that I found the end song super cringe.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,One of the best documentary ever madeI mean we know that it has happy ending that all boys will survive but still the emotionsThe moment they found kids and everyone is told about em and when the rescue was over all bous safe the tears just started pouring.
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"This movie is one of the best rescue movies I've ever watched. I only wish I had access to watch the whole 87 hours of video the company had access to as I would really like to see the full dragged out version of everything. But an absolute amazing movie, job well done Elizabeth Vasarhelyi, and. Jimmy Chin, and National Geographic on a absolute FANTASTIC movie! I hope this movie comes out on places like Amazon Prime or DVD so I can officially own the movie vs only being able to see it through a subscription (Disney+)! If I had to give it a rating of how good of a Movie this is from a 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best), Id give it a 20!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"After seeing the film all I can say is wow. It's such an incredible thing to see with all parts of the world coming to do something quoted impossible. To go against all odds with an attempt so daring and dangerous to save a group of boys trapped deep within a cave.This is truly an amazing experience to see and feel, as if you were facing decisions as challenging as them, and to be relying on sheer hope to get through really can feel like an emotional roller coaster. In the start of the film, I was thinking to myself how interesting this is and how truly astonishing it is to see. I could slowly feel the intensity and the complexity rising in this daring mission of saving lives and belief.This film shows how dangerous and luck implementing it would have to be to get something like this done and to be successful. It really makes you wonder what kind of world we live in and how we could live if it was like this in and throughout our everyday lives."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"The way this rescue was performed was astounding and this documentary captures it all. Highly recommended! On the most part, it's a 'feel-good' story that could've had a very different outcome had it not been for the thousands involved in the rescue of the team and their coach!"
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Amazing documentary that demonstrates strength, courage, togetherness. It was very gripping with already knowing the story from the news, however each decision and choice had time limits and without these professionals involved, this could have been a very different story. Really emotional watch and one of the best docs i have seen."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"Incredible all these journey! Well presented in this documentary, no exaggeration or Hollywood stuff, really impressive what different cultures can do together when you have respect for each other."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"For anyone that wants a totally gripping and brilliant documentary, this if for you! It will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. The footage is beautifully documented."
紧急救援,The Rescue (2021),,2021,2020.12.18,"It is one of the best documentaries ever made. Living in Australia, we were not privy to most of the information relating to this rescue. Bloody incredible."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"All those 1-star review bombs are exposing the current climate of McCarthyist sinophobic hysteria in the west pretty accurately.For anyone not suffering from McCarthyist hysteria, this is a decent movie with well-crafted, tense, and dramatic action scenes. It also does it's job of illustrating the theme of ordinary people being capable of extraordinary heroics feats and self-sacrifice when under existential threat.Also, a good choice to feature Mao Anying's participation and death in the narrative. It showcases that the social class he was born in as Mao Zedong's son mattered nothing, because death is equal to all when fighting a war.Less well done were the scenes of the American side. The directors and script writers did provide at least a couple of scenes of American soldiers talking about home life, and I thought this was a good choice to provide the American side with some humanity. But the actors were really chewing the scenery here, especially in their line delivery, which was unfortunate. I think, however, that this can mainly be attributed to the fact that these actors are far from being A-listers. Unfortunately, China still has not build up a decent pool of ethnically non-Asian quality actors, so I foresee more of this happening in the future.Now a bit of historical context here on China's motives for partaking in this war:A few decades before the Korean War, China had been brutally invaded by imperial Japan through the Korean peninsula, which started off the theater of WW2 in the Far East. Given that this history was still fresh in the minds of the Chinese at the time, China was very sensitive to any happenings on the Korean peninsula. For that reason, they warned the American side multiple times not to cross the 38th parallel or they would force China's hand. The Americans thought the Chinese were bluffing and crossed that line anyway. This (and the American fleets that had gone to the Taiwan Straits in the summer of 1950) convinced the Chinese that the USA would try to invade and colonize China after taking control of the Korean peninsula. To preemptively stop this threat, China decided to set up the People's Volunteer Army to defend against the existential threat."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Seeing all the one star English ratings here. I honestly doubt they actually watched the movie in China at all since it ranks at least 5 stars just for the action scenes alone. I watched it more out of curiosity and to me, it was surprisingly a decent movie. Note that both koreas back then were dictatorships and the obvious reason why America sided with south Korea was because of fight between socialism/communism vs capitalism.This movie was designed for a socialist audience obviously. For Chinese, they know about the Americans intervening in a domestic civil war and then invading and occupying North Korea. And bombing the country heavily and wiping out approx third of NK population and bombing civillians indiscriminately. From their pov, they were helping their north Korean comrades to fight back and to also prevent the western capitalists to move on next into China. So this film is set from their perspective that those men were heroes which would not resonate well if you're someone who is very right wing and hate communism.Nonetheless politics aside, the film is not supposed to be as close to real bitter war life film but the theme is much more about comradary between soldiers and beating the odds and hardship. Men freezing in their foxholes and working together to move forward against the enemy. On that regard, it's actually a very well made film with lots of interesting and gripping war scenes. The CGI could be improved but the action and the raw emotions in the film, def did impress me. The film is definitely meant more for a patriotic Chinese audience politically speaking, I actually enjoyed it more than I should but I am not a very political person. I wouldn't recommend the movie to right wing Trump fans. It will make your blood boil lol. 😄"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Although it must be disappointing from a US perspective seeing its own troops portrayed as the enemy, and getting routed by a supposedly much weaker force, it accurately depicts the battle from Chinese eyes. Each side views history from their own perspectives. The US is clearly not used to seeing itself as the villain!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Not a bad movie, a bit long but overall good.PS: ignore the other reviews that give it a 1. I have seen so many 1 and 10 for a movie before. Bega me to think the 1 reviews are not objective about the movie, but personal feels."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This is one of the best movies this year for sure. Excellent cinematography and script. Great action and costume. Great director.The US propaganda and woke media tr0lls will be against this movie for sure. It's a movie you want watch a few times.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Not really had any war movies in the cinema this year, and to get this, and from a Chinese perspective, is good, and a change.Make no mistake, this was shot in IMAX, and looks brilliant, plenty of giant FX houses come up at the end credits, and you can see why. The action is spectacular and the war violence is all there, very gory. The acting is all solid as is the story and direction, if a bit overlong so I think some trimming would be nice, that's my real only problem.I'm quite sure there are some problems, history wise, as I studied only WW1 and WW2, so I can't comment on this. As entertainment, it's fine, just try and see it in IMAX / Super screen, if you really want the best from this film. Lots of good stuff from China these past two years, more to come."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Please save your time and energy by avoiding this movie. This movie tries to be this heroic and exciting war movie. But the visual effect and sound mixing suck. For the most part, all you can hear is bombs going off randomly, but the sound mixing is so bad that you could hear anything other than loud noises. The visual effects look like they are a screen recording of Call of Duty, despite this being China's most expensive film yet. Wandering Earth was way better and had better VFX. American soldiers are portrayed as the typical ""white, brutal, and racist"" people, which is very racist for any filmmaker to do. The way different situations play out in this movie is ridiculous."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I looked through some of the comments of other people, including some who claimed to be history students. The history he studied may be just a profile.First of all, it is really not a propaganda tool. I am sorry to say that the resistance of many Westerners to this movie. In real time, this is basically the real Chinese understanding of that period of history. Perhaps this reflects a huge difference in cognition.Whether who won or lose, for the Chinese, that war is iconic. Before China was involved in the war, the Chinese government did repeatedly (15 times in my impression) not to cross the 38-degree line. However, no one listened to China's warnings. That's the in real history, and China have to engaged in the war which they did not want.In the historical memory of the Chinese people, the general trend of the war is consistent with the movie. The mainstream view in China does not believe that China won the entire Korean War, but that China in that barren era achieved its strategic goals by virtue of its tenacious will.And whether these characters are completely equivalent to the plot of the movie, we don't have to take it seriously. But for the Chinese, that war gave birth to many heroic deeds. These heroes and veterans will certainly magnify some facts in their memories, but they do represent the will of that era. But to a large extent, we can understand these plots as the Chinese collective memory of this period of history.Friends who study history, if you really go to Afghanistan to see what happened there, you will find that they have their own historical memory. I think that in fact, no matter whether a country wins or loses, there are heroes. These countries and people should be given a chance to write their own heroes. In fact, many heroes may be just small people. Maybe they have gone through a certain period behind the flashlight. They are just the epitome of the times. If there were no movies and literary works, they might have been forgotten long ago.What needs to be emphasized is that if you really understand China, China is very disgusted with war. China has experienced too many history and feelings that Westerners are not familiar with. On the contrary, China has great sympathy and empathy for countries and individuals who are in war or suffering.Aside from this, the movie itself has a basic performance in addition to the mentally handicapped special effects, whether it is individual or as a whole.Regarding the issue of actors, in fact, most people in China do not understand the meaning behind the expressions of foreigners, so they cannot judge the acting skills of Westerners, just like the Chinese faces in countless movies do not hinder Western judgments.Maybe to you, the story of this movie is meaningless. But the story here does express others' understanding of the same period of history."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"So this movie is a huge box success, approaching over $1B in revenue. It depicts a pivotal battle in the Korean war; a war between the United nations and communist China and North-Korea. A war that North-Korea started and if it had lost it North-Korea would've have been no more and you'd have a united western Korea.Now this context matters to me when I watch this movie. North-Korea is a failed state and a terrible place to live. How can I root for the Chinese forces when the end-result of their victory is so bad? They didn't just die for nothing, their death was actively bad for the world.Now cinematically this movie isn't too great either. The story telling is predictable with a cartoonishly portrayed evil enemy. The CGI is really underwhelming, especially considering the budget. It's just modern day propaganda, I just wish China had picked something else to be proud of."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This film tells the story of the event wars, told through the experiences of an outstanding army against foreign imperialists.People who are complaining about ""propaganda"" in this movie clearly haven't seen american sniper, lone survivor or any others american propaganda movies that are boring and lame."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"For a war movie, it is not bad, at least have some plots. The sad truth is that there is no winner in this war, that's why it's dragged for three years and no one can claim to be the winner. But since it's a movie, not a documentary, I don't think we need to discuss the truth or fiction here. However, many reviews are anti-China, I highly doubt those people ever watched the actual movie."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Commissioned by the Chinese Communist Party to commemorate their 100th anniversary, The Battle at Lake Changjin pours an entire nation's jingoistic fervour, anti-US sentiments, blatant propaganda & more into a 3-hour long war film that's no different from majority of Hollywood war films in its fact distortion & history revision but it's a tad too simplistic & predictable to deliver on the storytelling front.Directed by Chen Kaige, Tsui Hark & Dante Lam, the story is a fictionalised retelling of the battle that unfolded between Chinese soldiers & American troops during the Korean War and is crafted in a manner that's meant to provoke nationalistic pride in its intended audience. While the first hour is uneventful, things do get better once the battle is on and the film does well to make sure the interest isn't entirely lost from thereon.The mass battle sequences do deliver the goods but only when it's being waged in close-proximity. Still, for a $200 million production, the CGI is an absolute cringe and prevents several scenes from making their desired impact. Further weakening the ride is the narrative approach, awful dialogues, cardboard characters, excessive runtime, repetitive action, weak performances & overdone sentimentality. It is a state-sponsored picture and it shows.Overall, The Battle at Lake Changjin has moments of spectacle and the swift pans & camera manoeuvres add the necessary cinematic touches to its action sequences but there is a lot in here that could've been further improved. The caricature depiction of US forces isn't really a complaint since most American war films do the same. However, the extreme flag-waving on display is so forceful & overpowering that it often kills the film's unabashedly entertaining aspects."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The movie itself it's absolutely entertaining, and the history behind it is something that should never be forgotten. I just keep having the feeling that this should have been made into a mini-series like Band of Brothers, so that the whole story can be told better without having to worry about packing character building, backgroud setting, actual actions and a lot of other stuff into one sitting.(And 3 hours is not a short one as well...)The UN combined force--mostly Americans are being potraited a little weak on the battle side(again, can be fixed if it's a series with 10+ hours of run time), but definitely better on the human side. One simple example, when they saw the soldiers that froze to death, they didn't salute out of respect as a soldier, but shot every one of the dead body to make sure they are dead...Getting a lot of 1 star reviews simply means the movie did it's job, nobody loves being rubbed in the face with his loses."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Great to see the improvement of Chinese movie. Performance is great and it's based on real historical events.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"There are too many distinct inferior positions for chinese to respond the war,but if they make a concession,the war would have to be undertaken by their children."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"""The Battle of Changjin Lake"", also known as the ""Battle of Chosin Reservoir"", is a conflict that raged in extreme weather conditions from November 27 to December 24, 1950, between the American invader and China, and which resulted in the immense victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.The purpose of this great epic war film, directed by Kaige Chen, Dante Lam and Hark Tsui, was to produce an important educational film, and tribute, to understand our History - A counter-US propaganda film, which can be shown in any context, both in China and abroad, at any time.Therefore, and in order not to fuel animosity between the parties, it does not show the mass murders perpetrated by the US invader in (South) Korea, which started the war. Nor any of the heinous imperialist war crimes, such as the carpet bombing of cities, towns, villages, or other areas containing a concentration of civilians (only suggested), the use of chemical and biological weapons, as well as the burning of forests and the poisoning of rivers.This did not prevent angering the imperialists and the populists in the West, as well as their lackeys in occupied zones, at the portrayal of events, which illustrates how brutal the United States was.Still, presenting American troops with dignity is more than what the occidental world historically has offered to most of its own Asian actors."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"There's not about one person or some superhero to kill all they enemies, This movies about how Chinese people love their country and suffer so much. I watch this movies twices and still crying.If you care about the truth history, you should watch this movie or if you don't you just hate this movie and keep hate China base by you imagination."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"It's 1950. American forces have landed at Incheon and driving north towards the Chinese border. The politically ambitious warmongering American military leader Douglas MacArthur insists on bombing Chinese border locations to cut off supplies and retreat for the North Koreans. Chinese leader Mao decides to answer the provocation and sends in the PLA. They would confront the Americans at Lake Changjin. The Americans would call it, the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir.I'm not going to argue for accuracy. There is a definite deliberate slant to its views but it's not overtly wrong. A perfect example happens quite early. Somebody gets CGI happy and puts in a sky full of American fighter planes. There is more chance of them flying into each other than bombing the right targets. It's insane how many planes are in the sky on their bombing run. It's like a WWII mass bombing raid except it's utter chaos. Something similar happens to the American characters with one exception. There is one heroic competent war leader. Otherwise, the Americans are mostly arrogant, fat, and throwing up his breakfast. It's a political slant to sell to the Chinese public. I would compare this to Pearl Harbor without the romance. It's not a good thing. The CGI is a micro-step down from that. The story is over-the-top melodrama. The film is using a lot of slow-motion action. The best war scene happens quite early with the soldiers faking dead on the dry river bed. If it stayed semi-realistic, this could have been good."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"What an amazing cinematic experience! I don't want to spoil it for people, so I'd just say that it's an incredibly well made movie depicting the bitter cost of war intermingled with the heroism exhibited by the people involved.Check it out, you won't regret it."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The movie is basically a propaganda with made up and a lot of historical inaccuracies.The real battle was a meat grinder for chinese soldiers, due to bad planning, strategy and intelligence and it is weird the CCP want to portrait this as heroic. That's ridiculous and historical rewriting of the korean war. No surprise the korean themselves hated the movie.Also it goes without mention that the movie is too long, becomes boring as it progresses. And don't believe chinese numbers, they were rounding up people to inflate cinema numbers."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"China has long history to be involved in Korea War several times, the war in last century is just recent case and one segment of all the record. I believe the greatest movie about Korea War should come from joint filming between US and China. This movie is first portion to provide the perspective from China side, why China has to fight and how to achieve the draw with powerful US army under so series conditions. This may be little bitter, however the draw is the factor and award to the weaker party."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"All these 10/10 reviewers are 'New Users', it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on here. Not only do the CCP want to change their history in films but also try to manipulate the reviews on imdb for this disgusting fantasy film. Try to portray themselves as the shinning hero in films but in reality they pull out every dirty tricks in the book. Shame on you."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This film had the potential to be excellent, despite it's inaccurate take on certain historical events. The studio spared no expense in every department bar one. The film looks stunning, it's beautifully shot and the scenes high up in the mountains force the viewer to feel like they're sat in -40 temperatures. The sound is amazing too. Every hum of an airplane engine, every clank of an automatic rifle, even the wind creates and sets the perfect atmosphere. The Chinese cast is also on par with the movie's scenery and soundtrack. Some great performances and cameos, especially from Hanyu Zhang as a stone-cold sour faced general. One is then left to wonder, why on Earth the studio shoe horned in sub-par writing and wooden actors for the American military scenes. Had it been one or two scenes of English dialogue, the movie could get away with it. However, the director continually insists on giving us scene after scene of ""Americans"" delivering bland and emotionless dialogue spouted by actors that barely seem worthy to play roles in kindergarten plays. It upsets the pace of the film entirely. We go from sustained excellence to being interrupted by pointless interludes of American soldiers producing dialogue a ten year old could write better: ""Did they fall out of the God damn sky?"" one American officer protests as he flails his arms up and down like he's attempting to fly. General Mccarthur is also an issue, his entrance on screen is akin to Darth Vader bordering Princess Leia's ship, he too splurges emotionless void dialogue in his press conference which the director devotes several minutes too. This very much tells us, here's your bad guy; this is your nasty naughty American general who wants nothing more than to blow you all to smithereens. So what happens after he finishes his poorly written speech to the press and troops? He disappears from the entire film. Bare in mind, this picture is three hours. We all could have saved some time if these pointless American scenes weren't even in it. The actors make the whole thing feel like some college kids made this as a history project. The end result is, what should be a stunning film about a chilling and brutal battle, still the only occasion in which Chinese and American troops have directly engaged with each other, ends up annoying the viewer and makes the film go on for much longer than it needs to."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"In terms of plot, it is just your average big screen generic war film no different to Pearl harbour film. It's predictable that you know who is going to win and the soldiers have to face hardships. For me, the fighting action scenes like when it goes smoothly from tanks to knife fights, was what's most awesome. 😍You can actually feel the emotional rush in the fight scenes and the film captures it with top cinematographic effects. If you're into big screen action films, then you would probably blown away by the skillfully made fight scenes.However the movie is based on a controversial war and I did expect propaganda. Arguably I suppose you could also call it a propaganda film since it indeed mocks General MacArthur's claim that he will win the war and bring the troops home by Christmas and as our historians know, that didn't happen. But what surprised me was that it really humanises the Americans as soldiers who care about their buddies and weren't bad people. So it's not as jingoistic as people imagine. It showed that even enemies were human beings.Regardless I think this movie appeals Most to those who love very skilfully made action films regardless of your politics.And if you do watch it, you should def watch it on a Big screen as you can see that it was obviously a every expensive film with no expense spared in the production and big screen film qualify.. Albeit some of the special effects were subpar but the general cinematography was beautiful. And I can actually understand why some people would watch it over and over again. The action scenes alone and the skillful transitions were mind blowingly impressive and addictively good and I very much enjoyed this blockbuster just on action scenes alone. ❤"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"From a film storytelling standpoint, it's perfect. Amazing war film!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Let's be honest, these people that give this film a 10 stars are no critical thinkers and not very educated, they have been brainwash by their own government. The truth is China have been making film and tv series fabricating their own history for decades and they have been very popular, you can still see a lot of them on tv, Chinese killing off Japanese, killing off Western folks, their story, acting and directing are appalling but they get high praise, why? Because it makes the Chinese feel proud of themselves in their own make believe world. Sadly, many of them can't think for themselves and believe what they see is true without doing their own homework, can't blame them, just feel sad for them."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Although the acting of American characters was a bit unnatural, this epic war film contains lots of epic action scenes. The cinematography provided immersion in those fateful events where the characters had to show unimaginable resilience in the face of mighty threats. In this film, I felt the courage of Chinese young warriors who are willing to risk it all to protect their homes and defend the country. In this film, China, war-torn and yet to become a major power, had to face down the world's most powerful military, but Chinese people are not to be trifled with. I felt the wisdom that led the Chinese people to fight this war which is: ''Strike one punch to avoid a hundred punches''. There was a noteworthy line: We fight all the wars that we have to fight so that our children and grandchildren will be saved from warfare. The takeaway: Chinese people cannot be trifled with and it is not easy to stop them once they are riled up."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Both of the Chinese and the US arm forces are admirable since they are fighting for their faiths.I suppose this film tries to inspire modern Chinese people with some bloody history: the elder generation shall never surrender to violence and power in whatever situations. Those who are hostile to China hardly get this.However, I wish there will be no wars so all of us could stay in peace."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I'm from China and not a bot, I have to say everyone in China who got sanity, definitely treat this as a piece of garbage.But however, from the 700m box office of this piece of garbage, you can see that there're tons of insane people in China, they are totally brainwashed and they just want war.So what I can say? All I can say is that if Germany got 1.4b people before WWII, then they may triple the box office if they got a similar anti US or anti world movie like this. And maybe it's not 700m then, it would be 2bor even 3b box office earned.From this I got a conclusion: Humans can be easily brainwashed by something, especially something that brainwash you everyday. Another conclusion is that human are mostly stupid, that's how they can be easily brainwashed!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Watched this movie and it amazes me all the anti China reviews. This movie is mostly based on facts and off course with some fiction. Yes it was released because of the 100th anniversary of the communist party. But claiming that the battle of lake Zhang Jin is a solely propaganda purpose and claiming all is fiction is clearly a lie. Scenes were based on documentaries and even a History professor from a reputable university claims that the majority of this movie is based on facts and off course adding some fiction in it. So sad that we in the west can't accept facts anymore. We have accepted lies as facts and facts as lies. Awesome movie and a must watch. The 5/10 rating is bogus. It should be more.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This is a historical war in China and worthy to be celebrated. Looks like westerners aren't very comfortable with Chinese citizens saluting their own veterans.Have some respect and basic human decency, especially to the fallen ones. No one booed Captain America (yes, that is also american propaganda, if you can't tell by the name) when he frisbee'd his shield around.P. S. Everyone here complains about how bad the western actors are in this film, yet turns a blind eye to the same untalented actors in ""Squid Game."" If the western acting was so terrible, go ahead and write your gnarly and nasty reviews there too!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I don't care if it's propaganda, US movies are propaganda, too. At least this one was entertaining to watch. Something I cannot say about most movies produced in the US currently."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"A lot of audiences surround me were crying, especially ladies. However, I do not recommend the movie to west audiences. Americans won't like this movie including abc (american-born-chinese). This moive is for Chinese, Americans in this movie were just a bunch evil idiots. Therefore, I won't expect any west audiences will leave high rating for this great movie."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"People seem to forget Mao's own son died in North Korea, killed by Americans. However, he shook hands with Nixon to make peace. This alone deserves a Nobel prize."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"To begin with, North Korea did attack the south counterparty first but both south and north were actually working hard to prepare for the war. Either of them was taking peace as seriouolsly. Either of them could be the starter. Merely the north was a few steps ahead.The so-called UN troops were simply American troops plus someof her reluctant allies' negligible soldiers. Did Korea has any issue with Turkey, Poland or Thailnd? Absolutely no.America did not cross the China-korea border but that's not the key point. On one hand, America did promise to protect the regime of Chiang Kai-Shek in Taiwan island and America actually sent a fleet in the summer of 1950 to the Taiwan strait to obstruct PLA's operation to reclaim Taiwan. It's an absolutely challenge, or should I say, threat to China. On the other hand, China had warned American troops a thousand times that American troops should not cross the 38th parallel since the invasion of Inchon. General MacArthur simply kept ignoring it. To keep foreign forces outside the 38th parallel is a bottom line form China's perspective. Imagine what will America do if Russia had military activity in America's neighbour,for example, Mexico? Actually Russia did try to deploy missiles in Cuba and the US-Russia relationship instantly free fell to the bottom, and the world was pushed to the edge of war.This is the true context of the movie. It's ok if you don't understand because we don't share a similar background."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I don't actually like heroic main theme movies, but I pay for them every time because I should support movies in my own country . This film showed a stereotype of American troops as moronic and evil, with lots of fighter aircraft, - bombs, submachine guns as well as advanced weapons. Although we had nothing, we still won by our great adrenaline. I don't believe that. It's hard to convince me. But Ilike it's stunning effects. Chen Kaige made progress again. Anyway, I respect this history , I respect every soldier who died in the war, whether they were eating turkeys or frozen potatoes, they also had a family."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,So many 'New Users' registered just to give this film a 10/10 stars and leaving reviews praising the on how accurate this film is to the history. The intention is so obvious it's laughable.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"For most of the west, this movie seems like a propaganda. I wanted to check it for myself, the ending is indeed a propaganda against the west. But I believe that any victims of the west will feel the same as the Chinese if they can win a battle against the Americans. And this will hurt the pride of any Americans, even more pronounced if you support the right wing party(ies). Anyway, just don't watch the last 3-5 minutes and this movie is actually good.First, the movie is super violent. If you cannot watch people being stabbed and body parts being exposed, this is not a movie for you. In addition, the battles are super long. I like movies about wars to learn history but the battles in this movie are dragging it.Second, in no way this movie has shown that the Americans were barbaric or monsters. So don't get offended. It actually shows in some scenes that the soldiers just want to go home for the holidays and be with their families.Finally, the movie is depicting soldiers as heroes, but from my point of view, there are only victims. The sons taken from the loved ones just to amuse a bunch of politicians who want to show off who has a bigger d*ck. It even says in the movie that MacArthur by winning the war he would be in advantage to be the next president. So in some parts, the movie really show us what wars are about.I believe the movie are missing some parts, it explains very little of the reason of the war which was Korea. If you can get over your patriotism for the USA, then the movie is a good watch. I don't believe it also tells a good story but anyone can learn that this battle had happened and who were the actors."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Nice Storyline, excellent cinematography, mind blowing background music, heavy action & war scenes, perfect colour grading & shooting set design, costume design etc makes this film extra-ordinary. Though It's a Chinese propaganda, It's a patriotic film & quite enjoyable also. I enjoyed the whole time & didn't get bored for a moment indeed."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I knew the war was rough, but didn't feel the roughness until I saw the movie. So many good men died in protecting the border, and buried far away from their home. Their Chinese soldiers' equipment is so poor compared with the US army, a sensible man would not engage in a fight like this, but they did, they knew it better than anyone but had to fight the war ."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Action packed and inspiring slice of PVA s historic battle.It was an entertaining 3 hour movie, which kept the pace up for the whole duration.Just because the movie comes from China, it has lots of negaive reviews and less about the quality of the movie.It is quite funny for a country like USA that invaded and killed numerous people in Iraq, Libya, Syria....(list just goes on) to complain about a country that hasn't bombed any other country for the last decades. But then the US does not consider people in the middle east and Africa as people and bringing democracy is equal to bomb them to oblivion until US economic interest is fullfilled."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This garbage movie glorifies Chinese invasion of Korea which destabilized the region for several decades. North Korea suffering under a despot, Chinese citizens are suffering under CCP. The next garbage sequel will likely glorify Uighur concerntration camps and organ harvesting."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Took my family and grandparents to see it. My grandfather was 20 when Mao announced China's participation in the war. He was shaking at parts, and weeping throughout. After the film he wept and told us the stories of enlisting and praised how the film captured the harsh realities of the film very well. Respects to the fallen."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The war to resist U. S. aggression and aid Korea is because the Korean War has caused damage to Northeast China and the U. S. army bombed there, so China sent troops to fight.I can understand why the film got such a low score in the United States.But If you really don't understand Chinese history, don't talk nonsense. As for the so-called ""beautification"", I can only say that this film beautifies the battle process, because the real battlefield is more cruel.I wonder why some Americans think they know more about Chinese history than Chinese people. Do you think our understanding of history is only one-sided? Is what you know right?When will people comment on a film so that it doesn't involve politics?"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The storyline was very bland, and felt very heavy handed at painting what I personally felt was an over-sympathetic attempt at trying to convince the audience of the Chinese reasons for participating in the Korean war.Letters of Iwo Jima played an even handed and fair portrayal of the Japanese troops during the Battle of Iwo Jima by showing the humanity behind the war, but Changjin tried to do the reverse by an attempt to make a political statement using the emotional trump card through the characters of this movie. Thats they reason why the American actors have very simplified dialogs, and very bland acting. Even the battle scenes showing the Americans didn't feel very natural.Despite the high budget afforded to this movie, the CGI was also very poorly done and felt almost cartoonish at times."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Watch this as the crazy box office in china. It's really a history movie on war and you need to adjust your mindset watching a documentary more than a casual movie. The end.....
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The film is well-made, the stars are piled up, the scene is exciting, but it lacks the macro-serious perspective of major battles, the rhythm is improper, the literary drama is weak, and the finishing is hasty. It relies on uncontrolled indiscriminate bombing and heavy sound effects to impact the audio-visual senses. When the atmosphere is strong, the emotions are not mobilized, and it can only become an enhanced version of the anti-beauty film. At the end of the day, I feel that the < Ice Blood Changjin Lake >, which is presented almost in the form of interviews and pictures, is even more shocking, and it has the most authentic and moving picture of that battle."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"It's breathtaking to watch over this long history movie. It is hard to imagine that in the Korea war, for the first time, the modern Chinese nation demonstrated her bravery to confront a massive head to head against the US, the Super Power, with military forces armed from head to toes right after WWII era. Those high casualty battles in the Korea War actually helped the newly established Chinese Communist Party and Chinese Mainland Government to win respects from all nations. My sincere respects to all the brave Chinese and the US soldiers fought in the Korea War for their countries and believes. Though the ugly side of geo political deals with the leaders of Soviet Union and North Korea were definitely not included there in the movie, which gives people more interests to explore truth after watch the movie."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I highly recommend this film for those who are stress at work, have family pressures, or experience traumatic event that keep you from falling asleep. This is the cure. Millions of people with sleeping disorders have benefit from watching this film."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Plots, actions, CGI, sound effects, acting and costumes are all 5-star levels. When it need to be existing, it blow you off your seat. When it needs to be emotional, your tears just come out like a river . So well constructed.But obviously, for those who have biased about this country from the start, they will certainly say the opposite and giving one star and bad reviews. To me, don't mention about the history, it is a great and well made movie . So with no bias, film to film comparisons to western movies, I give it a 10/10So I hope you can also try to watch it as it is as a normal war film to film comparisons , with no bias . Don't be blinded by what so called ""communist China"". Just watch it as a war film ."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Definitely one of the best war movies I've ever seen with amazing cinematography! Shame to see it being review bombed by coping americans.Now that the PRC has become the richest country on Earth, I hope that we can see more amazing movies!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Digital platform driven era of our times, some propagandic messaging to ms jin and mr yan might be nescesarry, as well to commemorate the chinese soldiers that are still alive and kicking surviving the brutal and icecold korean wars 1950-1953, when ceasefire where announced but peace never agreemented. A weak spot in this wardrama of caotic and manslaughtering violence is that the United Nations are never mentioned, and just polarized as a battle between the voulenteer army of china and macArthurs american army. Koreans are bearly heard from at this checkpoint of war, also a historic blunder to wards the global audience. Also some of the cgi's are far to blurry and dominant, especially in the first part of the motion picture, but as a reminder about heedless leadership and horrors of war its a pretty good match .Plot and acting is generic as a fish in water when war is the main subject.if you are looking for female action look somewhere else, cause they just smile bravely and waves silently, throwing bundles of cloths after their men and typically enough, one red scarf to plant on the mountain by the lake. The u.s. Soldier is presented as a bully and a fool all the way through, so if youre redneck american, pearl harbour or midway might give a better aftertaste. But a torturous long misty fog of blood and guts youll get if you like them long and thin, for the grumpy old man its enough with one watch and a small recommend."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The dude is holding the Sten by the magazine which is shown in a lot of war movies, but it is wrong because the recoil can make magazine shift and the ammunition might jam.Also i'm not sure if it is accurate that the Chinese used western weapons. I would assume they would have used Soviet weapons (since they are both communist and this is before the sino-soviet split) such as the AK-47 (That's the only AK at the time because it's still 1951 during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir so the AK Modernized (AKM) hasn't come out yet) for their assault rifle, maybe a papasha (PPSH-41, fires the 7.62x25 mm Tokarev round) or PPS-43(fires 7.62*25mm) for their SMG, a DP-27 (called the DP-28 in the west, fires the 7.62×54mmR round) for their LMG, and a Mosin-Nagant (3-line rifle M1891, known in Russia as Mosin's rifle) as their bolt action sniper rifle. Also the officers are equipped with C96 Mausers (German).Also sure there were American planes that still had propellers, but I wanted to see some jet battles in MIG alley between the Sabers and the MIGS.Also the movie taught me some Chinese."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This movie is supposed to celebrate a great victory of Chinese people: The army of United Nations did a great favor for Chinese by cooking the son of Mao Zedong - the dictator and war criminal - into a roasted duck. The movie failed to demonstrate how the heroic US pilot saved the history of China. So don't forget to bring your own egg fried rice when watch it.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I am a Chinese and I have to say, I didn't watch this time-wasting movie, and won't watch it forever.To be honest, Consuming patriotism really sucks.Chinese movies suck now."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"As a cinematic action movie point of view, this was superbly done. The action sequences were compelling and gritty. And the historic view on both the chinese side aswell as the american side were pretty fair and accurate for that time and period. Some battle scenes and recreation of the sets were even top notch. This War was not a case of good and evil, as americans always like to depict, but it was a case of sovereign dignity.On a political point of view, people might consider this as a propaganda movie, but the fact is the chinese PLA soldiers did stalemate the Korean War, this is an undeniable fact, that even western history books admits. So how can it be propaganda when written history acknowledge the facts depicted in this movie. It was no secret at that time the Americans made it a mission to eradicate communism. They were preparing for it, and that led North Korea struck at South Korea first. However this act of War from North Korea was provoked by the United States. China at that time allowed United States to defend South Korea, but warned them not to cross the 38th parallel. But United States didn't listen and went straight to occupy North Koreas capitol city Pyongyang. If China have let American forces to take over North Korea, that means a direct threat to China aswell. Put yourself in their shoes, what would you have done? What would any country have done if foreign forces were right at your borders.?You fight and defend. So thats what China did.This movie might be melodramatic about it, but these chinese people have every right to make a movie to commend their fallen soldiers who basically fended off foreign aggression and for the next coming decades, created peace and stability in China for them to become the second largest economy of today, lifting millions out of poverty."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"As a Chinese,I think it's very common for Americans to rate lowly,and in this war, America also has its sense of justice,But it's really none of your business, right? And Chinese soilders also showed their faith and bravery,As for some bizarre plots,don't take it seriously. It is still an inspiring movie."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Saw the movie one day after it's premiere, not a blockbuster war movie like the American's, special effects too outdated, actors of the US or so-called UN army generally too poor at acting, some stupid mistakes on weapons, some over-exaggeration and under-exaggeration of the historical facts, still I'm giving it a 7-star rating as it really brings me back to some of the historical moments of the unavoidable war, reminds me of the great spirits of those courageous predecessors.(Absolutely love all the Chinese actors especially Zhu Yawen. He's role as a loving father, fearless fighter, resourceful soldier have all my respect. How I never get his charisma before.)Back to the movie.**Spoiler alert **China doesn't want to get involved in a war, any war, especially at a time when it just founded for one year. On several occasions in the movie, the leaders of the Chinese army and some volunteer soldiers repeatedly mention the reason why: They have to fight so that their future generations don't have to. Although too simply and straightforwardly put, it does give me a clue to search for more.On the inside, the baby PRC have basically nothing to start with. It's too vulnerable as the civil war is still going on, all the imperialist forces are lingering waiting for opportunities to come back. On the outside, as depicted in the film, the US/UN army have crossed 38N°, approaching the Yalu River, bombed over broader areas of China. Sooner or later they will break into China through Korea and China will once again be torn apart.The movie doesn't really put more focus on depicting the battle of Lake Changjin/ Chosin but on several smaller battlefield before that, so much so I couldn't believe it ends so abruptly with just some historical imagery and brief description of the victory. I'm not a big fan for war theme and pretty disappointed at the artificial explosion scene, still the battle scenes are very splendid presented. It's the first time this special war being brought on the big screen, and considered all the obstacles, I'd say it's a benchmarking war film for China.One important fact doesn't reflect in the movie got me confused though. The scene the US army general(?) salutes the frozen PVA soldiers is historically wrong. The frozen company was raked with fire not salute.I do hope war films like this reminds us of the hard-won peace and stable life we enjoy today."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This is a movie about the history that nearly twenty thouand Chinese died in the Korean War. I knew some true stories more than this when I was young. My fiend grandpa has been in the war and he was luckily to come back to his family but the war was crucial and most of his team and the leader were dead and could not come back to the home town and some died only in their twenties. I was touched and war is disaster for normal family and hope peace and love to all the world.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"I watched this movie with my Italian friends actually they found the movie great but not understood why I was crying for some scenes. I told them at that time there was no other choices but to fight for peace with war, maybe it sounds ridiculous but it happened. My grandparents told me years ago when they was children, the soliders enrolled in the army in my hometown have never come back again leaving their parents sitting at the door of house everyday for a whole life and hope to see their sons coming back. No one wanted a war especially China has experienced wars for a hundred year. It is very hard to judge a history event as different people see fm different sides. Peace is the dream for the people at at time but also our dream. We wish the land and the world will not have wars anymore."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Just by looking at the cast one should know it's a loud, noisy, embarrassing and time-wasting."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"If epic battle sequences with impressive visuals are what you desire in a war movie, then you're going to love 'The Battle at Lake Changjin'. This film looks amazing on screen. Yes, off course there's a lot of CGI, but a lot of the action sequences were practical, hence it contains stunning, very realistic battle scenes.Many viewers blamed the film for being inaccurate, but keep in mind this is only based on the true events, while most of the story and characters are fictional. Since I'm not familiar with the real events, I honestly couldn't care either way. I just wanted to be entertained. And, boy, I was!!!Our hero is Commander Wu Qianli (Jing Wu), who has to return to the battlefield soon after having returned home. The United States is depicted as the enemy - told from the Chinese perspective - and I therefore rooted for the Chinese. (Interestingly enough, when it comes to war, I don't really take sides, as I generally view soldiers as victims of circumstance, forced by men in suits in offices to follow orders).The battle and fight scenes are incredible, and the photography and cinematography are very good. Some of the battle scenes feel like they go on forever, which is probably what it must have felt like for the soldiers on the battlefield. These long fighting scenes are nail-bitingly terrific!! It's thrilling and super exciting. You're also bound to see action sequences like you've never seen before in a war movie. It quite simply is jaw dropping, with one amazing scene after the next.I must mention, with a running time of 3 hours, the film took about an hour setting up the scene and the characters. It was never boring, though, and I found the entire 3 hours well worth it. This is a war movie of epic proportions. The final battle scene at Lake Chingjin is spectacular!!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"In the future, there will be more war movies with a Chinese perspective, instead of boring bad Hollywood movies, well done!China is comprehensively enhancing its national strength, not only its economy, but also its cultural influence. The world always needs to update and more advanced things, which will be brought by China in the future."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"As a Chinese, I don't like this movie at all. This movie is kind of typical of Hollywood.It's not a good movie to tell the history of the battle of Lake Changjin or the history of the war to resist U. S. aggression in Korea.The movie didn't tell clearly that before Chinese army attended the war, the U. S. Navy's seventh Fleet had sailed into the Taiwan Strait on the orders of President Harry Truman. At that time, both Chinese government and Chinese people didn't want to attend a war again. But we have no choice.The movie seems to blame MacArthur for all these faults. But at that time, the U. S. government itself also supported attacking NORTH Korea and even China. China warned the US not to cross the 38th parallel, but the government's leader Truman ignored it and thought China wouldn't send troops. These weren't made clear in the movie.How the Chinese generals direct their soldiers to fight were not shown clearly in the movie. How the Chinese solders used wisdom and courage to defensed the tanks were not shown clearly in the movie either. They even let the main character use another tank to defense. That cannot be true.Even at the end, the director arranged for American officers to salute the dead Bodies of Chinese soldiers. I'm not sure wether an ordinary soldier would do it, but I'm quite sure those who led the armies to attack Chinese People's Volunteers would not. It's really ridiculous.The story about Lei was really great. He knew how to lead the soldiers to defense with wisdom, he knew to take advantage of the terrain, he also knew a soldier's sacrifice needs to be worth it. I cried when he died, especially when I heard the song of Yimeng. The Chinese sacrificed a lot in the war of liberation but now they need to fight again, to fight against the US army.Who started the war first? Who amplified the war first? Who is invading? OF COURSE, not China.Some people may think, the film is a propaganda tool for the Chinese government. This is ridiculous. This movie didn't even tell the history of the battle of Lake Changjin in a good way. Can it be propaganda? It wasn't nearly as much propaganda as Transformers, which showed off the U. S. military.Do not assume every Chinese film as a propaganda tool, to be honest, the Chinese directors weren't good at propagating politics as American directors."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This is the common issue not only in Chinese movies, but also in American movies.First, this is the issue of the entertainment industry ECO system.There are few this kind of theme movies yet. You have to have enough amounts of this kind of themes and enough time to allow good English speaking actors entering this field.Secondly, there is also an ideological issue here. If Americans shoot such movies with the same theme, the same issue would arise.Third, there is an issue of cultural background differences. After all, Chinese and Western cultures are very different. Westerners will not have such a problem when they make films about World War II between the Allied Powers and the Axis Powers."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This movie is about a company in the Chinese Army during Korean war movie. It is nice to see war from the side of the people resisting the American imperial industrial war machine of death for a change. Highly reommend.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The movie is just nothing good enough to admire, for it contains the American millitary with low IQ (couldn't be saved by their good equipment), and nobody PTSD about war even they had suffered from one?(WWII: it is enough to speak out my ID number)The very starting has a funny plot: Somebody(I've forgotten the man's name) said""Kim has Mao & Stalin to""(I've forgotten too,but it refered to Mao & Stalin), but Mao has shown up, which Stalin didn't.The only part that I like is when Wu Wanli(the name's meaning is fifty thousand Li,or twenty-five thousand kilometer)""drew eggs on his letter(or book? I've forgotten)"", which was the most interesting part, for it has a pun that close to it.(you shall master Chinese to understand)Not only the American Millitary but also Chairman's son had low IQ, for he couldn't predict when the bomb was set down, even with the vrooming aircrafts.The part of bombing was bad. Nobody above(100 people at least) even noticed that something wrong with a moving signal bomb(I know not much about millitary)?Even the ""amazing""(only better than others) plots didn't shock me, no saying for others, since they are unlogical, disobeying physical rules.The ending ""icy sculpture chain"" was a total failure in(or on?) the movie. The American commander saluted instead of ordering the soldiers in anger to kick them down(I would do so if I were him). Nobody in American millitary had his way behaving like in American millitary.To sum up, I hate this movie. I love my motherland, but I dislike the movie.My English is not so good, since it's not my native language."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. To enjoy this movie, however, one needs to throw away all the prejudice and political stand point first.The leading characters, Jing Wu and Jackson Yee, both acted so well that we could see the love of an elder brother and the rapid maturity of the 19-year-old kid brother in the war.The scene in the railway station is also inspiring. Knowing that the soldiers were going to fight in a place which was going to be very cold, the people seeing the soldiers off at the station all took off their coats and gave them to the strangers. The scene that a pretty female soldier took off her own red scarf and threw it to Jackson Yee was so impressive.The background music in the movie is good. The melody and the lyrics best matched with the movie.The movie is not perfect though. Those actors who acted as the Americans were not very good at acting. It's a shame that the producers are not able to invite good Hollywood actors to act in the film. It's understandable, however, that the Hollywood actors would not take the risk of being disliked by their fellow Americans. After all, the US lost in this war.It's also quite understandable that those people who are biased or dislike China would give low ratings for this film. Most likely, they either haven't actually seen the whole movie or they couldn't really understand Putonghua which is mostly spoken in the movie. I would strongly suggest that the film makers should seriously consider finding some good interpreters to make accurate good English subtitles."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The war scenes are not as good as some top tier movies (i.e. 1917, Dunkirk), but it's definitely good enough for you to feel the blood pump and excitements.Now, regarding the plot, I think it's an interesting movie. Portrayed Korean War from China's angle, which unsurprisingly is disliked by some people. But I think if you believe you are a independent thinker and would like to learn an event from different perspective, this is a movie that would worth your time."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,It's a great film. It shows you the part of the story of the Chinese side and their purpose as to why they joined the war. We are bombarded by American war movies already. There are other perspectives out there so don't let your bias take over. Be rational and always look at different angles.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This is the best film in the world! How can people say this is fake history film when all the American believe the film Rambo is real history? This film is 100% accurate and American lost the war and got scare because they see the power of China! Just accept it. You all should go watch Wolf Warrior as well and see how China soldier beat up the American Navy Seal easily. Go watch and learn your history!
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"This is not gonna take place in one of the best war movies for sure ... but this is not that bad to have rating bellow 6.If you are a typical westerner and used to enjoy American heroism or believer ""all super hero's are born in America"" this movie is not for you. Moreover, they VFX is not Hollywood level. But remember this is the second highest revenue making movie in 2021 after spider-manOne things that really bother me is that this movie is considerably long that makes someone bored ...Overall, good to enjoy war from different angle.Too much obsessed watching victory of Americans in every Hollywood war movies although they lost at many battle. Here's some excitement watching them lose.Those who under rated this movie "" Bro .. Come out from your box. America wont win all the time. Forget about propaganda , politics. Enjoy movie."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"To tell the truth, I didn't like this movie either. It was mainly the directing and writing.But as a Chinese, I respect this history.In 1951, China's steel output in one year was less than that in the US in four days.The Chinese are afraid of death! Also know that may not be able to return home alive.But why were they Marching in the rain of bullets? Is it because there are machine gunners behind the soldiers who shoot deserters?The reason is, If they die in North Korea, only American soldiers may be buried with them, but if they die in China, they may also be buried with their loved ones who were slaughtered by the US military.Thanks to them, they used their lives to prevent the tragedy of the Vietnam War from happening on Chinese soil.The movie is not good, but history is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"As an audience,the impact of the movie is very good. However,the logic of the story of the story is not very dense. I don't mention too much example.The audience who read the movie is naturally understood."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Pretty nice movie the Battle scenes are fantastic, but the plot is like... Meh.... Too much heroism.... The military details are also not accurate......"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"After watching this movie, I just want to say that war is really cruel. How important it is to have peace. The characters in the movie use life to guard the lights of the house, which is really moving."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This film really shows the war from China's perspective. Yeah it'll be uncomfortable for an American citizen to watch cause US isn't the villain in movies often times. And the film is totally worth your time.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"In 1950, China's ninth Corps first entered North Korea. When these brave soldiers were immersed in the good news of the founding of new China, the news that they needed to step into the smoke filled battlefield again came to their ears. What was the mood of these martyrs who protected us from the wind and rain at that time? I don't understand. However, everyone knows why they fight so bravely and desperately. Not everyone can stand the cold and hold a rifle. In the cold wind, they are willing to turn into ice sculptures and are not willing to shrink back. This extremely great and optimistic spirit and this selfless dedication all come from the martyrs' love for new China and their vision and desire for a better life in the future."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Overall entertaining war movie, distinct main characters, great visual effects, plot is OK. Cheesy and overally emotional moments here and there where credulity is stretched a bit much for entertainment/political value. That said, China being the rising superpower of course you'd expect waves upon waves of anti china propaganda from the west, nothing from China can be praised for fear of not being politically correct, so adjust the points upwards accordingly to get the real rating of contemporary big Chinese movies."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Another review I had read is really good from IMDB member: doraravw.This movie is the same as almost all Westerner or other countries supporting their own country to brain washing their people. There is nothing to bomb at like those Westerners whines because their movies are the same.This movie is quite nice compared to many and its worth to watch in a cinema.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"... remember, it is a retelling of an event in history. A good movie will portray accurately the experiences of those involved in no matter what side they fought on. Some do not want to admit the truths. Arrogance is a human condition, existing in some clouded minds, making them think they are better. Both countries showed the true horrors of war from their perspective, with open-minded and honest directionship from the filmmakers. Strength does not come in numbers, it truly exists in the heart of the few who bravely never gave up to protect their right to exist in peace. Despite the accuracy of cold-hearted and ruthless portrayal of the U. S. army, their humanity was shown in that heart stopping scene of the frozen-to-death soldiers. It brought the true horrors of any wars fought in this way to the surface. The director has to be praised for their accuracy, the actors for their portrayal of normal human beings in such extraordinary circumstances that they never invited to happen. Thinking only of their families and wanting nothing but peace, sacrificing their lives to protect like-minded souls. This movie is without doubt worthy of high praise and deserves the highest score, to be seen by many just as open-minded individuals and win not one but; many Oscars!!"
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"Very patriotic propaganda with some mediocre battle scenes, sadly nothing new or interesting, USSR did same level of propaganda long ago, but for 80s it was innovative."

长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Loved the movie although it could of been better with the way the cut the scenes. Kind of got confused for a bit with the scene jumping back and forth.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"First of all, those who wrote fake reviews bashing this movie here are the most uneducated people, among whom is the author of the review that had accused others as being ""uneducated"". Uneducated people should not project their lack of education about the topic onto others.That being said, the portrayals of the Korean War in this movie were largely accurate, with only one exception: The Chinese never used ""human wave"" tactics as often ignorantly portrayed through the false stereotype in the popular media. Instead, they were known for charging only in three-man squads.In this movie, I guess the only plausible reason for some portrayals that appeared to suggest something like a ""human wave"" tactic at times was only because the movie directors and producers wanted a more ""spectacular"" feel and look of massive war scenes in their movie in order to appeal to the average person's expectations from a war movie.Having said that, I want to add some background facts here to back up my opening statements about the accuracy of the movie portrayals of the Korean War:The Chinese, especially their infantry, in the Korean War fought better than the German infantry did in WWII, not according to me, but according to General Sir Farrar-Hockley, former Commander-in-Chief of NATO's Allied Forces Northern Europe who had been a veteran of both WWII and the Korean War, and a POW during the Korean War. In his memoir titled ""The British Part In The Korean War"", he had this to say about the Chinese soldiers in the Korean War: ""Having fought in both WWII and the Korean War, I have witnessed first-hand how the German, American, Soviet, and Chinese soldiers fought. I have to admit that German soldiers were superior to those of both the Americans and the Soviets. But Chinese soldiers were superior to those of the Germans.""The Chinese won because of absolutely brilliant and unique strategy and tactics combined with unrivalled discipline and a will of steel that was tougher than nails, unlike any of their opponents.It is an ignorant stereotype that they used ""human wave tactics"". For example, the Chinese soldiers never charged in ""human waves"", but instead formed three-man squads in charges. If they had depended on manpower and ""human wave tactics"", then they would not have incurred only 171k lives lost, according to official U. S. military estimates, throughout the more than 3-year-long war against the overwhelming odds of fighting the 18-nation U. N. alliance led by the world's only Superpower which had total technological superiority and dominance of all of land, air, and sea, virtually unlimited supplies, as well as manpower that totaled more than 1 million troops in the world's harshest terrain and climate where the extremely cold and bitter Korean winters were unlike any other.For perspective, in WWI, 60,000 British troops were killed in only 1 day of fighting when they used a real human wave tactic against the Germans, even though the British had been more or less equally well-armed as their German opponents.By the time of the Korean War, almost 40 years later, the technologies of war had evolved to become much more lethal than those of WWI, capable of causing more deaths much more easily. So, if the Chinese had used ""human wave"" tactics against their foes, who were light-years better armed than they were, then it goes to figure that they would not have lasted even 3 days, let alone for more than 3 years and were still going strong even to the last moments when the ""Armistice"" was finally signed by both sides to signal truce.Yet, despite having been often outnumbered, vastly outclassed technologically, vastly outgunned and outsupplied, and having often lacked food, water (many of the Chinese soldiers could only get water by eating snow), clothing and supplies just to protect themselves from the harsh wintry elements, while also lacking almost any heavy weaponry until very late in the war except for what they were able to captured from the enemy, the Chinese PVA (People's Volunteer Army), which was one of the most backward peasant armies from one of the poorest nations in the entire world, still was able to deal defeat after defeat to the U. S.-led 18-nation coalition, pushing the U. N. alliance back from near the Yalu River all the way down the peninsula and across the 38th and 37th parallels, and even capturing the South Korean capital city of Seoul several times. So under-equipped were the Chinese that a large proportion of their total casualties throughout the entire war was caused by not having enough protection from the elements or starvation.This was why the Korean War is known in U. S. history as ""The Forgotten War"", because it was the first time that the U. S. was not able to win, despite having had vastly overwhelming advantages in all aspects of power metrics against an enemy that could not have looked more backward and pathetic. There's so much that could be written and listed about the war that illustrates why the Chinese were still able to prevail, and none of it having to do with ""manpower"" or ""numbers"".On the other hand, real human wave tactics were actually used by the U. S. side at such pivotal battles as Shang Gan Ling, where record-setting infantry feats of world military history were made by many Chinese soldiers like Hu Xiu Dao who single-handedly defended an important hill, killing more than 280 American soldiers in the process, after his fellow soldiers in the company had been killed in an American airstrike and artillery barrage. Even the American media at the time branded him a ""murderous monster"". Similar unprecedented and still unrivalled kill-ratio world records of military history set by the Chinese against the American and U. N. forces during the Korean War, like that of Gao Shou Yu who also single-handedly defended three different garrison bases, killing more than 120 U. S. troops single-handedly, while mainly using weapons captured from fallen enemy soldiers, after his fellow soldiers in the company had perished in an American airstrike, were aplenty, and in fact too many to list here."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,Misleading title. Should change the title name to 3 man show. Didn't see much of the team work here. Can see there a 3 main lead while other just supporting small cast. Didn't show much what the reason for war. China drama Li Yannian show u how a war movie should be film and not this type of heroic.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,This movie portrays the Chinese nationalism against American imperialism and their defeat in Korean War. You will witness the determination and spirit of Chinese soldiers throughout the movie. Worthy of watching.
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,A fantastic story about overcoming odds and fighting for what you believe in. The door that was opened by Parasite to east Asian films will lead to some incredible works of art hitting the mainstream in the US.

U can just use troops to deal with everything. Enemy Fighting Postion? Just loop mortar. Enemy tanks? Just pour troops to climb on them. Enemy Airplane? Just use Bazooka or Grenade to destroy them. Chinese troops are even stronger than Captain America. When assaulting MG nest, they kill US troop inside by Sten and M1A even more than a M1919 pouring fire just to kill 3 Chinese lol. Chinese Mortars are even better than Electronic Guide System we have right now, all shots are pinpoint to the targets.

They won.To the Chinese, the war started at the US bombing Dandong/US troops advancing towards the Chinese border, stopped at the 38th Parallel. They won.To the Koreans, the war ended where it started. There is no winner.Plot: Mediocre.The main plot is based on true events that occurred during the Korean War. Though it's not something the West audience has been taught/educated with. Some of the details are overly exaggerated (like the swarm of US attack planes and PVA soldiers) to hype the drama which is mostly criticized by the public.Cinematics: GreatThe battle scenes are intense and chilling. Chinese Rambo indeed lolProps and Costume: GoodThe cast crew did their homework.Character & Lines: Poor. Especially for the US side. Typical Pokerface + Stereotype.

Especially in democratic countries."
长津湖,The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021),,2021,2021.11.19,"The movie depicts the battle as a great chinese victory. A patriotic story of defending china's borders. China did not achieve their goal of destroying UN forces, they did drive them out of north korea. Some units were eliminated, victories were celebrated as the greatest chinese triumphs of the entire war. The movie showed chinese patriotism, nationalism and heroism every 5 or 10 minutes. The constant saluting just made me queasy. From what I leaned it was sub-zero temperatures and no food or water that took most lives. Additionally it was starling that had manipulated mao long ago and thus he was hellbent on proving to Joe that he could surpass the US even on the battlefield because in his own words. ""Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive one; it is man and not materials that counts."" Now Xi also said something along the same lines. Xi Jinping threatened that any nation who gets in the way of China's priorities ""will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel of 1.4 billion chinese people. Notice how both say people and not themselves who should be at the front of the line."" Obviously a movie backed by the pcp, you were bound to see huge red flags and cheering in the cinemas I bet.

Army's B-29 heavy bombers and P-51 fighter jets made 13 sorties in 5 batches and invaded the Ji'an, Linjin, and Andong (now Dandong) areas in northeastern China. 3 Chinese residents were killed, 21 people were injured, 5 train locomotives, passenger cars, and guard vehicles were damaged, and 2 trucks were damaged. Zhou Enlai, in the name of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, called the US Secretary of State Acheson, saying that ""I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, lodge a serious protest to the United Nations regarding the provocation and brutality of the American invasion of North Korean troops into China's airspace. The US government should respond to the US military. This time the violation of China's sovereignty and the killing of the Chinese people bear full responsibility and its consequences."" Zhou Enlai asked the US government to: 1. Immediately punish the provocative and brutal crimes of the US Air Force invading Chinese airspace, killing and injuring the Chinese people and destroying vehicles; 2. Responsible for compensation for all losses suffered by the Chinese side.Zhou Enlai also declared: ""We reserve all rights to continue to make demands for such provocative and brutal acts of the United States invading the North Korean army."" On the same day, Zhou Enlai also called the United Nations to demand sanctions for the provocative and brutal acts of the US Air Force invading China's airspace.On August 29, U. S. Air Force planes invaded China's Kuandian County twice to carry out reconnaissance and shooting, killing 4 Chinese residents and injuring 7 people. The U. S. Air Force admitted that there was a cross-border incident, but blamed the pilot's navigation error and expressed its willingness to take responsibility for compensation after the investigation.On September 15, 1950, the 10th Army of the US Army landed in Incheon on the southern west coast of the Korean peninsula. The Korean People's Army suffered heavy losses and turned to a strategic retreat.

Go to Nineveh, that great town, and let your voice come to it; for their evil-doing has come up before me.1:3 And Jonah got up to go in flight to Tarshish, away from the Lord; and he went down to Joppa, and saw there a ship going to Tarshish: so he gave them the price of the journey and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish, away from the Lord.1:4 And the Lord sent out a great wind on to the sea and there was a violent storm in the sea, so that the ship seemed in danger of being broken.1:5 Then the sailors were full of fear, every man crying to his god; and the goods in the ship were dropped out into the sea to make the weight less. But Jonah had gone down into the inmost part of the ship where he was stretched out in a deep sleep.1:6 And the ship's captain came to him and said to him, What are you doing sleeping? Up!

怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,The movie has ample amount of action and some good hand to hand combat but somehow i cudnt care about any of the characters and the movie aint engrossing enuff.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I found it to be an excellent action movie.I went to go see Donnie Yen bring it and he delivered, despite this feeling that Yen is hit by old age. You can tell he was avoiding the quick punches from Ip man that he most likely cannot pull off any more, but he makes up for it with this new raw, tough and tumble style, made to look special with some great camera work.Than again, another reason for Yen's change of styles could be that I was expecting a kung fu flick but what I got was just this complete action film. It has everything you would expect from an action flick: Gun fights, car chases and fight scenes and what makes it nice is that you get more than one of all these things.I can't honestly give a good examination on how the story goes as my mandarin is non existent and I read subtitles at a 6th grade level, but I'll give some credit to the acting that got me engulf in a story I was barely picking up. Some good character development was going here on the big screen.I would love to say that this movie is as good as Heat, or somewhere around there because the movie feels like they 're trying to get there, but that's a little too ambitious. It's a decent police drama with a whole lot of amazing action and I'll leave it at that,"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I'm a huge Donnie Yen fan. As one would expect of a movie he stars in, the fight scenes are awesome. Fast paced but completely clear. Brutal without holding back for MPAA rating. And the non-fight action is also enjoyable.Unfortunately there are only 3 or 4 action scenes in this 2-hour movie. The rest is run-of-the-mill and ranges from mediocre to useless. It brings down the movie for me and keeps it from being rewatchable. (1 viewing, 3/12/2022)"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"This contemporary Chinese martial arts crime flick is a perfect vehicle for its two male leads - Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse. Yen plays the good cop. Tse is his former good-cop buddy, who has become really good at being really bad for reasons we learn along the way. Many of these films are thrown together with a muddled plot that exists only to set up their action sequences. Here we have a shining exception, as main characters and their backstories are fleshed out to fine advantage, making for a production that satisfies the brain as well as fulfilling the desired adrenalin quota.Yen has nearly 80 acting credits and handful of directing stints, including fight-scene choreography. He comes by his art honestly, as the son of a martial arts master (Fun fact - that's his mom, not his dad.), trained from childhood in multiple disciplines. Although I've only seen about a fourth of his films, I'm inclined to think that at this stage of his career, Yen may be incapable of cranking out a bad movie. (I specify the present because after writing the previous sentence, I caught one of his flicks from 1991, showing he didn't always have good scripts to choose from.) He's perhaps best known for starring in the history-based Ip Man series. There, as here, Yen embodies the stoic integrity of a Gary Cooper, with the bonus gift of kicking butt like a Jet Li.The Raging Fire plot involves a cop-killing band of robbers, motivated by both grudges and gains. Yen is in charge of catching them; we learn early that Tse is the ringleader, with his motives unfolding throughout. The tale plays out more coherently than is often the case in Asian cops vs. Gangs flicks (actually, the same is true for many Hollywood entries, as well), magnifying the emotional impact of its splendidly-staged action sequences, stuffed with all the fights, shootouts, chases and explosions genre fans crave. A couple of Yen's one-on-ones are particularly exciting and creatively staged.Late director Benny Chan deserves credit for not only pacing the action flawlessly, but editing and lighting those scenes for clarity of who's doing what to whom that's way above the norm from both sides of the Pacific, in what is, lamentably, his final project. Tse is also superb as a more complex villain than usual, with an understandable, almost sympathetic, transition from valued colleague to nemesis. That all adds up to a gem within its genre."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Action movies from Hong Kong are almost universally packed with spectacular stunts and crazy set-pieces. ""Raging Fire"" is no exception. The cinematography is really nice... but the editing and the direction are a little choppy, which leads to some confusing storytelling and some hard-to-believe sequences."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"There is nothing to be picky about at the production and action levels. The overall completion is very smooth. It is also a good work in Hong Kong action films in recent years. It is gratifying that in recent years, Hong Kong directors have become more and more brave in shaping the characters in the gray area. After Infernal Affairs, many directors have been assimilated or hidden by capital and began to make some relatively safe works. In recent years, because of the change of the general environment, the ""anger"" in the creators' hearts has been aroused again, so there are very representative figures such as pan Chengfeng and AO. They can't be defined by a simple dualism of good and evil. This is the most real place of human nature. From the perspective of Chen Musheng's own works, it can be regarded as an upgrade of the new police story. In essence, there is no great new idea. There is little ink on the inner struggle of the characters, which can only be defined by cool films. However, as a creator, it is a happy thing that the posthumous work will be so widely recognized. I would like to pay tribute to the director and thank him for creating so many romantic and warm dreams."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Yen Smolders in 'Raging Fire'. Donnie Yen has clearly established himself as an international, bankable action star. He is not only a dynamic martial arts action star, but a highly watchable screen presence.In Raging Fire, Benny Chan's final Directorial work, Yen combines the elements of his persona as an action star and dramatic actor for a successful result. His dramatic engagement equals his action prowess, and these elements combine to make this film superior.Shan (Donnie Yen) is a highly respected hardline cop with a long history of success on dangerous cases. However, his past unexpectedly comes back to haunt him when a sting operation is attacked by a mysterious group of criminals led by Ngo (Nicholas Tse), his former protégé, a talented former officer who had once respected and admired Shan. However, a terrible mistake three years prior landed him in prison, quickly turning the once rising star into a furious man with a grudge, and the will to destroy everyone who had wronged him-including his former mentor.Many East Asian action films have a common theme showcasing the blurred line between police officer and villain. This film is no exception. While Yen is clearly the protagonist, Nicholas Tse is a sympathetic, albeit ruthless, adversary.The film's story is not necessarily original, but it is engaging. Both Yen and Nicholas Tse bring a deep gravitas to their performances that makes them sympathetic, despite the circumstances. Nicholas Tse' performance is a strong counter-balance to Yen's. Yen's does not have as much depth and meaning without Tse.This film is unusually deep for an action film, and perhaps, that is defining signature of a Benny Chan film. Here it is executed on a high level.While the film has dramatic elements, there is no shortage of action. The knife fight choreography is about as exciting as you will see in any film. While I could write on about the dramatic undertones for paragraphs it is the final Yen-Tse showdown that puts this film among the top of the year's martial arts action jewels. The fight choreography is sensational.I am sentimental; so I couldn't help but feel sad that Chan will not have the chance to see the international acclaim this film will likely garner. The closing credits feature behind the scenes clips of BennyChan in action, directing this one. He is clearly all-in.The film is subtitled."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Good editing can improve on a so-so script but not even the best editor can improve on a convoluted, disjointed mess like this one. Good production values are no substitute for a solid story that hooks the viewer. An hour into this, you may still be wondering who you are supposed to root for. Yen playing a stoic cop looks lost."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Whilst the plot is nothing new, Raging Fire is an absolutely incredible action thriller full of memorable set pieces and is definitely a superb and bittersweet final film for director Benny Chan.Donnie Yen gives an excellent lead performance whose physicality is balanced against more dramatic moments. Nicholas Tse is a superb villain, equally physically capable with believable motivation yet still managing to be gleefully evil.Benny Chan's direction is phenomenal with a variety of standout set pieces including hand to hand combat, shootouts and car chases. The music by Nicolas Errèra is great, consistently ridiculously bombastic which helps to make everything even more dramatic."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Raging Fire is a gripping cops-and-robbers action movie that is elevated by late director Benny Chan's attentive direction of its drama and explores its theme earnestly. Donnie Yen's riveting action sequences set a new standard for Hollywood-level production values in a Hong Kong action film.Bong, an officer of the Regional Crime Unit, is an outcast in the police force due to his overly righteous attitude and a refusal to conform to the legal grey zone, much to the frustration of his superiors. Bong is left out of a police drug bust, where the entire police team is massacred by a masked gang of thieves.The crew is led by Ngo, an ex-cop-turned-criminal and former protege of Bong. Ngo once beat an informant to death and Bong's unwillingness to lie in court cost him a five-year prison sentence. Ngo sets on exacting vengeance on Bong and the police department.Benny Chan directs the drama with delicate hands, surrounding star Donnie Yen with character actors Ray Lui and the always underrated Patrick Tam. Chan effectively brings the audience deep into Yen's character moral dilemma, ""Is it justifiable to do a bad thing to do some good?"" Yen's cop says no while Tse's thief says yes.Benny Chan ensures that every fight is dramatically motivated. The action sequences, including gun fights, car chases and martial arts, leap off the screen in a glorious adrenaline-pumping fashion and consistently feel dangerous. Through a combination of shooting on-location and CGI, the film makes great use of the Hong Kong locales that brings a consistent tactility and realism. It is also doubly fun if you know Hong Kong.Nicholas Tse, despite putting in a huge effort in giving a complex performance, never finds proper footing for his villain. He acts as the calm and cool collected mastermind but goes completely unhinged in other moments. The film does a solid job earning the audience's sympathy by showing Ngo's backstory as a cop. However, that crumbles in the present story as we witness who the villain has become and the incongruities in his grand plan. Is the character desperate for revenge, wanting to score cash, or just completely nuts? It all falls somewhere between. As the third act rolls in, there's no more time for the script to clarify Tse's intentions.That being said, Raging Fire has a lot to offer. Nostalgic Hong Kong action movie fans will walk away satisfied. The film ultimately won me over with its overwhelming ambition to break new ground. I wonder now what Benny Chan would have done with his next action picture.Rest in peace, Benny Chan."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Hong kong police action drama. That about sums it up, except this is a very good movie for fans of this genre. The story is interesting and there's action galore. And the cinematography is great. And i hate to spoil it for you, but i bet you'll be rooting for the ""bad"" guy."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Raging Fire is a Hong Kong action thriller directed by Benny Chan, known for genre films such as Who Am I?, New Police Story and The White Storm in his final directorial effort before his untimely death. Starring Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen, the film goes back to the identity of Hong Kong action cinema of the late eighties and early nineties with a dynamic contemporary twist.The movie revolves around highly respected hardboiled cop Bong who doesn't take any bribes and always speaks the truth which often puts him in dangerous and difficult situations. His former protégé Ngo was forced to go to prison due to to Bong's testimony in a controversial trial. Once out of prison, Ngo has become a different man seeking vengeance upon everyone who had once wronged him. After a streak of violent crimes, Ngo finally faces his former mentor to conclude his quest for revenge.Raging Fire convinces on many levels. The plot finds the right balance between emotions and energy. The crimes committed in the film and their immediate reactions are sparked by bitter, passionate and tragic feelings.The characters are truly interesting. Bong is a protagonist who is an outsider but easy to identify with because of his strong beliefs and convictions. Ngo is a tragic antagonist who was once a dedicated and talented officer who has become blinded by frustration and greed. The conflict between these two men carries the entire film in a gripping way through more than two hours of fast-paced entertainment.The actors and actresses manage to incarnate their characters authentically. Donnie Yen convinces as righteous cop who never seeks for the easy but rather the right way out of trouble. Nicholas Tse goes through significant changes with his character who develops from a promising cop over a tragic victim to a grim avenger. The supporting actors and actresses also manage to become one with their roles and add some depth to the film.The action sequences are up to the highest contemporary standards. Pitiless martial arts fights meet frantic car chases and brutal shootouts. The different scenes offer much variety and never overstay their welcome. The camera work isn't overtly hectic and the scenes are easy to follow, dynamic and captivating.The only element one could possibly criticize is that the plot is somewhat predictable and certainly doesn't reinvent Hong Kong action thriller cinema.At the end of the day, genre fans will appreciate Raging Fire as one of the greatest action thrillers released in recent memory. It can not only compete with the golden age of Hong Kong action cinema three decades ago but also with contemporary Hollywood movies and franchises such as John Wick and The Expendables. Due to its spectacular cinematography in general and its excellent sound and visual effects in particular, you should try to catch this movie on the big screen. Up to this point, I would consider Raging Fire as one of the three greatest movies released this year."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Is it really a thin line? A line that anyone might cross if pushed hard enough? Even someone considered to fight for and protect the good and innocent? It really is tough to say - although I sort of think and would like to believe that Donnie Yens character would not fall into that trap of going over the top or crossing the line.Benny Chans last movie - a really good one. And apart from Donnie Yen (also action choreographer and if you know him, I need not say more), it is especially the very charismatic Nicolas Tse that lifts this movie up. You almost root for him too. At least you can feel his pain.There are vibes of Heat here, especially in one big action set/shootout. And that is meant as a compliment to both films. Still Heat had more gravitas if you think about comparing them. On the other hand, this has more fights and action set pieces ... and really good ones at that. And that is what this movie can boast with ... if you're a fan, you might not even care about story issues or certain characters not getting more screen time."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Very typical Yen, Tse, Chan Hong Kong crime story w/usual car chases (very boring typical & unimaginative); police/political corruption (like China's leaders today). The usual street fights/shootouts of many against a few w/the usual jump fight scenes between cheap tenement housing structures. The usual drug deals; cops killed."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"RAGING FIRE is a fitting swansong for Hong Kong director Benny Chan, who died during post-production. It's a cop thriller throwback to the likes of NEW POLICE STORY and INVINCIBLE TARGET, with Donnie Yen typically playing a dedicated cop on the trail of a gang of robbers headed by Nicholas Tse. The film suffers from being overlong - half an hour out would have improved that - and from over-complexifying a rather straightforward scenario. But the action zings, particularly in Donnie's two fight scenes, and the climax is a real delight. It tends to avoid cheese and overwhelming sentiment which is good too."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"This is easily the best action film of the year, the detailed fight choreography and the strong physical performances is what made this film. Worth to go and need to go to cinema to watch in order to feel the great action scenes such as fights, explosions, car chase, gun shoot scenes. These high level HK action movies are rather rare in recent years, it certainly is a great enjoyable moment in the cinema watching it. Highly recommend. It was so fun and entertaining, and the action scenes delivered hard. But warning it is really brutal."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Hong Kong police are well known to be -and always have been- as corrupt as the politicians and criminals they mix with. At least that was the case way back when in the time of this 19080's style Cops & Robbers outing (and I very much doubt it has changed any in this day and age). Anyway what we get is an action filled manic paced bullets and blood thriller. What little script there is for the actors is all really by the by and of no importance whatsoever. I say that because this is meant to be nothing else but a pure 100 mile per hour action gobsmacker. Its not a brilliant film actioneer (if you have seen any John Woo films you'll know what I mean) but it is certainly not rubbish either. Its just what it is and its very engrossing and entertaining.Donnie Yen's fight choreography, for all the cast, is superb (and I'm sure he'll pick up an award or 2 for it) and the camera work is flawless in its accentuation of the vicious array of martial arts mayhem.Its a great finale to a very good man of Asian Cinema and guarentee's that Benny Chan went out with a monumental big bang! R. I. P Benny and thankyou for all your input to the cinema of Asia!"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,Sadly benny is gone but he left us another superb movie. I'm old been watching if movies for decades. Sad no more bc. Next John wick with mr yen.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"So there's the usual mad stunts and fight scenes, plus some great performances. Lots of smashing up cars, loads of gun fire and explosions, the final scene is pretty darn good. Is it Chan's best? No but it is a fitting film for his last. Cheers Benny."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I had high expectations for this, for god sake the movie called ""Raging Fire"" so I'm very justified in having high expectations.The movie makers thought they were making the next Heat or Den of Thieves with this one. Sorry to disappoint you, but the story was boring and not interesting, the script was awful, too much uninteresting talking and some really bad acting from few actors. The cat and mouse game was uninteresting; we know everything that's about to happen, so there were no surprises.Everybody is coning for that Hong Kong action, spectacular stunts and crazy set-pieces. There is very little action camper to the lengthy two hours run time, to be excite, there is just 50 minutes of action in this two hour movie, and not all the action had good editing.There is enjoyment in Raging Fire, it's not a bad movie, it had a few action scenes, so don't have high expectations going into it."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"If you're looking for an action film with good acting, dialogue, that's at least semi-realistic... This isn't it.Pretty standard action flick with cheesy dialogue and acting. The action scenes are decent if not ridiculous and non-sensical at times."

怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"The script is relatively simple, classic black and white duo mode, trying to achieve a revival of fashion action movies (or just back to the light? Type elements are readily available. The gray area of the foot is not the center of gravity (not to mention the design only for the establishment of character image, neither of them has more development). The focus is on the strength of the fists and precision design of the fight, both sides with full anger to maintain an idea, have to burst into a fierce enough scene. The church fight in the third act has obvious sublimation intentions at the end, but the empty body can no longer be filled. Cherish Director Chen's memory!"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Yes, this was the last action masterpiece from late Benny Chan, whom passed away on August 23rd 2020. Yes, it's as explosive as his other works. From the first 15 minutes of the movie, you will already feel the tension of the action atmosphere. And it continues until the end of the movie.Donnie Yen always deliver extraordinary action perfomance. Nicholas Tze also believeable as a tragic villain. And don't miss cameo from HK veteran actors like Simon Yam, Ray Lui, Benny Lin and many more. This is a must watch for HK action movie addict!Definitely 8/10."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Going in, one would expect a typical Donnie Yen film, with great martial arts moves and well choreographed. You do have that. What I am surprised to find is the pacing of this movie, with so many plot twists and including so many different plot elements thrown in. It's not a black and white movie, you find yourself not liking Donnie Yen's character on some instance. That in itself is not often find in HK movies.When I part with the movie, you don't remember a specific move of Donnie Yen's fight scene, but one would remember Nicholas Tse's character. If Benny Chan extends this movie to includes how Nicholas Tse turn to the dark side, That would be amazing.Much have to be included was the camera work as well, HK is a photogenic city, but the cameraman's work is really amazing. HK movie have come a long way. I would like to think that there might be a story boarder on board. The sequencing and storytelling aspect is really on point.HK movies don't usually creates counter heroes, They did it in INFERNAL AFFAIRS. Hope this trend continues."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"A very serious-in-tone and slick/modern in look ""Cop Drama"" with lots of action, themes of revenge, innocence and justice.It's a very enjoyable movie that impresses with the choreography and set pieces. The production is beyond impressive, just like the stunts that are filled with realistic aggression and raw violence. With wonderful and dynamic camerawork, as well as decent locations and great lighting.And while it entertains throughout without question, it doesn't leave you with much to talk about or discuss. No memorable lines (at least from the dialogue shown in the subtitles), or revelations. Pretty standard, at least from what you can expect from a competent movie.. One you consume once, and move on.The bad guys are really well written, but there is no way for it to end but what you can anticipate from the beginning.And again, the action is just too good to miss (which is the majority of the movie).. exactly what you can expect from Donnie and actors at his level."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"The police have a tip on criminal boss Wang Kun's next deal. They intercept, but things go seriously wrong. What follows, is a cat and mouse game between cop Cheung Sung-Bong and the criminals, and corrupt cops.With way too many characters and the constant use of flashbacks I honestly was confused at first, not knowing who all the characters were and who to root for (except Sung-Bong, off course - played by Donnie Yen). To confuse you even more, the film then suddenly jumps to the kidnapping of Mr Hoo, but I had no idea who Mr Hoo was, why he was held for ransom, and whether there was a connection between him and Wang Kun.Due to all the confusion, I simply enjoyed the first half of the movie for the action sequences, which were fast and brutal - similar to 'The Raid', although not as brutal. After the halfway mark, the film makes much more sense once it becomes clear who's side you're meant to be on, and who the antagonists are. Unfortunately the film does suffer from characterizations. The film will definitely benefit from a second viewing.Ageing Donnie Yen is still in good shape, and still kicking up a storm! The film has a very good climax, and I thought Nicholas Tse was good as the main antagonist. By the end of the movie, I was satisfied with the film, how it developed and how it ended. This was entertaining and good fun, with some amazing action sequences. Well worth a watch.Be sure to watch the end credits on this one."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Donnie Yen deserves credit for becoming the next mega-star in the world of martial arts movies. His style on screen shows he can not only deliver when it comes to fight sequences but he is a talented actor as well. From historical dramas to comedies to police thrillers he always gives it his all and it shows on screen. His film RAGING FIRE shows this.The film opens as police detective Cheung Sung-bong (Yen) is about to arrest his longtime foe. As he moves in to make the arrest a heavily armed gang breaks in shooting everyone in sight, from the criminal he was going to arrest to members of his team. Surviving the attack Bong begins to look into who this gang is and who their leader might be. He's stunned to learn that the leader is Yau Kong-ngo (Nicholas Tse), his former partner just released from prison.The past story of what took place between these two police officers and how Ngo was disgraced is broken down as the movie unfolds. Having taken things to the extreme as an office Ngo was disgraced and sent to prison on the testimony of Bong. Now Ngo alongside the officers who were disgraced as well are seeking revenge, turning their skills and knowledge into becoming criminals. Their revenge seeks what they feel is justice against everyone from the top police staff to the banker who set them up to Bong himself.There is no way mere words can describe how well made this movie is. The story is solid and the acting is superb. While Yen shows that he can continue to make fantastic movies giving his all for both the fight sequences and acting, it is actually Tse who steals the show here. Where most bad guys are fairly cardboard cutouts of characters seen in the past, he brings a life to Ngo that makes him dangerous and sympathetic at the same time. He exudes charisma in the role while Yen's character is more bland. But that's what you would expect from these characters.The film is the last to be directed by Benny Chan who died during post production of the film. This was the 25th film by the Hong Kong director whose first feature film was made in 1990. He was noted for his high octane fighting sequences and fast paced films that were faithful to the tradition of Hong Kong action films. It's sad to think after watching this that he's gone.While watching this film I never found myself wanting to reach for the remote, to hit the fast forward button to get through some boring sequence or car chase that we've seen over and over again. Everything here felt fresh and new, even if it wasn't. I felt myself pulled into the story as it was revealed and that's something amazing for a film to do.So many people still can't bring themselves to watch movies made in other countries and that's sad because they limit themselves and miss out on some fantastic films. This is one of those. Well Go has done an amazing job of bringing Asian cinema to the home market and that should be taken advantage of. If you don't believe me pick up this movie and see what I am talking about. For action fans this is a must have for your collection."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Just seen it. And damn if it isn't one of the best action thrillers of the year. The simple plot is only slightly muddled by putting characters in morally shady areas. But these action sequences are splendid, showing off both the budget and choreographing skills of everyone involved. From brutal hand to hand combat to epic shootouts and car chases, Raging Fire has it all. The film's tempo is fast and only a little bit slower once all the fighting and killing takes a backseat, meaning you won't be bored even when the film gets into its preachy mode (noticeable in a scene or two). Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse were both great in their roles, showing off impressive agility and speed in the more physically demanding sequences.Overall, it was a gripping, intense rollercoaster ride that I will gladly experience a few more times in the future."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Very predictable story. Acting and scenes are really good from the main actors. This is one show that you probably might support the antagonist.There are little parts that i didnt like, like it didnt seem to make sense how cruel can ex-policemen be...........They literally killed anyone who they didnt like........Also if anyone seen the show The Sniper with Huang Xiaoming as the main actor. The story line is actually 80% the same."

All in broad strokes with little detail. It more errs on the side of pro wrestling than serious character development.But nobody does action and its lightening speed and attention to nuance like HK filmmakers. Great knockoff of the shootout in Heat. Yuen is still a solid fighter on screen."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"An amazing HK action movie. I love Nicholas!!!In this movie, you cannot image how attractive Nicholas is!!!R. I. P. Director Benny Chan!"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"A fitting farewell to Benny Chan's legendary career in Hongkong movie industry. Raid, gunfights, suicide bombs and fistfights truly upped the ante between cliche-ridden melodramatic flashbacks. Yen showed great nuance into his conflicted role as dedicated police."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"As BC passed on, this film definitely stamped on his status as the last great actioner to left us since Ringo Lam. It did had the ""Heat"" vibe though i thought ""the modern Andy Lau classic"" *forgot its name already* feels more Heaty than this. Besides the grand finale shoot out, the final fight is dam great and close up 2 the level of SPL double fights with Wu Jing and Sammo Hung. Thank you BC again 4 this great masterpiece and HK action may not be the same again 4 the next 8 years."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Nicholas Tse's acting skills are stellar here, so was his actions. Dennie Yen's acting is on point too and the film is definitely a much needed injection to the Hong Kong film industry when the rest is lackluster. Worth every second. Reasonably thought out plot. Not many people go seeing it because of Covid."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I love Donnie Yen but not sure what happened here. Talking, talking, talking. First fight scene was 40 mins in then talking, talking, talking. I couldn't make it through the whole film as the story just didn't grip me either. Disappointing, I would of preferred a sequel to Flashpoint."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Donnie Yen approves as the martial artist and action director that he can make some good fight scenes like should be in Hongkong Cinema. It reminded me of SPL: Kill Zone, Flash Point and New Police Story. Best fight scene was at the end with Nicholas Tse."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,A movie with Donnie Yen about fighting the communist leadership in china and free china from corrupt incompetent communists would be nice but we get this movie .. no words .. is not a good movie to be kind to the IP MAN.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"This is the new Cantonese action crime thriller set in Hong Kong. It stars Donnie Yen as Cheung Sung-pong, a highly respected and experienced cop with a long history of success on dangerous cases. His path crosses with that of his former protege Yau Kong-ngo (Nicholas Tse) who after 4 years in prison in a case where Cheung gave evidence against him forms a gang and seeks revenge on those who have wronged him.I couldn't quite get into this film at the start, I thought the story was a wee bit cheesy. However as the film progressed it got much better. There was a clear good guys vs bad guys dynamic, the bad guys ambushing a drug deal, stealing the proceeds and then going on to target the high profile individuals who were involved in putting them in prison for what they believed was an injustice. Donnie Yen has over the years become one of China's main action movie actors. The action scenes and martial arts were brilliantly done and the last 30 minutes were pretty cool.Overall, it took a while for me to get into it but it is one of the action films of the year. If I'd watched this film 10-20 years ago, I'd have been blown away. This film took me back to the action films I enjoyed growing up. A clear good guy/bad guy, some brilliant shootouts and a massive showdown towards the end. 7.5/10."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Director Benny Chan's last outing due to unfortunately passing away, is a fun martial art flick.Raging Fire has amazing and stylish fight choreograph that are exhilarating. Additionally, a great performance from both Donnie Yen and Nicholas Tse with the intense rivalry of their characters.However, the story and characterization is bare bone with the movie having moments of slow pacing due to long expositions and overuse of flashbacks. The movie did not need to be 2 hours. It also has a slight clash of tone as the first half of the film has action set piece that feel grounded and gritty. The second half then starts having these really cartoony action scenes that make it feel like a completely different movie.Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable martial popcorn flick that will definitely keep you entertained for it's run time."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Everything else should have been left on the cutting room floor. The dialogue is terrible, the story is predictable and the pacing is extremely inconsistent. If you have a two hour runtime you need to give us a reason to care for the characters. The action sequences are interspersed throughout the two hour runtime inconsistently, leaving a lot of time to fall asleep when nothing interesting happens when people aren't being stabbed or shot. If you can't fill the gaps of the movie without action with somewhat interesting substance than you might as well rewrite the script to have a better flow and cut the runtime by thirty minutes.All gripes with the story, pacing, acting and characters aside. The the action sequences are a delight. There are several that are directed with a level of energy you don't see in big Hollywood blockbusters and it was a pleasure watching the choreography on screen. What helps the action is the variety. There are fight sequences, car chases, shootouts, knife-fights and the obligatory hero vs villain fight scene at the end. No doubt the action will satisfy anyone looking for bone crunching action. Unfortunately everything else will make you either fall asleep or check your phone waiting for the next action sequence to commence."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"A typical cop movie, but Nicolas was a former cop where he was Instructed to do bad things by boss and later sent to jail. The gang came out and had their revenge. He is so charm and should be awarded for his act! The fighting and shooting scenes were great, and it's a pity the director passed away after this movie..."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Nicholas Tse's acting is a counter-balance to Donnie Yen's action.I feel like the final fight is an homage to the great Baton Vs Knife alley fight of the famous S. P. L. Between Donnie and Wu Jing.Qin Lan is so beautiful as the protagonist wife.Good Story, Good Action, what more do you want?Rest in Peace, Benny Chan. Thanks for making a good HK action movie."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,RAGED after the film. Boring plots made me fall asleep. No emotional link between characters so quite puzzled who was dead and why they're crying :)Definitely do not merit 7.3Don't waste your money like what I did.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Whether you'll like this movie will depend on what you want from an action film. If you want mindless fast paced action, then you should enjoy it, but for a film with substance, i'd advise looking elsewhere.The story is all but non-existent, leading to a pointless conclusion, i really had no interest and any characters except Donnie's, who of course is as cool as always.As for the action scenes, they come from 2 ends of the spectrum. On one hand you have the gripping, brutal, jaw dropping fight scenes, with some great cinematography and in the other, head scratchingly farfetched chases, that make Fast and Furious look believable.So all in all, this isn't the worst movie ever, thanks to the Martial Arts skill that the leads have and the Choreography skill of the stunt team, sadly it just left me uninterested after the first 5 mins, so unfortunately one of Donnie's poorer films."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Donnie Yen probably made this movie as an excuse to smash things up lolWhat a fun movie this was. This is your typical signature Donnie Yen movie, with unapologetic hardcore brawls, together with an all star cast and a barrage of renowned Hong Kong actors, new and of the past, having cameo appreances. This movie is like a revisit of old school Hong Kong movies what we all came to love, and ofcourse there are even some Hollywood influences, with fast paced action and dialogues and a story line that goes all over the place lol. Also the theme that there is no absolute good nor absolute evil in the police force is a reoccurring theme, that even applies in real life. I give it a 10 because it didn't took itself all too serious and some scenes were even comedic, paired up with some awesome action sequences, so you can't really go wrong with this."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"When i hear that the movie is gonna be action and with Donnie as a a main star, it always bring happiness to me, because you know, that this movie will be at least fight-action blast, so do Nou Fo or Raging Fire, but it has it's flaws.Story is pretty typical, especially if you are a big fan of chinese/korean action movies, standart story about revenge, betrayal, family and some morality. Only the problem for Nou Fo is that it takes too much time to ""build up"" everything we know and see before and didn't add something special. So for the duration of 2.00 hours +-, there are lik 80% of talks, drama, obvious cliche's and 20% of action, which can be bad if you are expecting a non-stop brutal fights along the way.Action scenes, that rares parts of them, - fast, bloody, and beautiful, even though gunfights are bad due to very cheap graphics, but hand-to-hand are worth to watch. Graphic itself are bad. Car chasing, car crashes, fire, explosions.Heroes on other hands are suffering from the same problem as a story, almost all of them are just copies from other famous characters, especially the bad guys with no proper logic to their actions.Overral, if you love action movies and you love Donnie's works - this is must see, even thougt if wont fulfill the hunger for action, but in other case its not worth that much time."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I can't believe I suggest one of my best friends to watch this film with me tonight. What a bad film it is, but a lot of guys rate it high.The film is badly organized in terms of plot. You just watched them fighting for almost 65percent of time in this movie and can't get in to the plot and characters."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"The movie was quite intens cocnerning actions but it is indeed a little bit the good cop, bad cop. Certainly when his friends are out of jail and seek revenge. A lot of action but script is indeed a little bit poor for being a nowadays mobvie. But recommened to watch."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I will start with RIP Benny Chan, you will be missed.This was OK..too many gaps between action though unfortunately. Still a thoroughly enjoyable film. The reason for the Seagal comparison is the incredibly obvious use of stuntmen in place of Yen, even in some of the fights!! For me this should be Yens last film. He cannot wow any more, kung-fu killer, flashpoint, spl etc are way out of his reach now. That said if this is your first taste of Donnie then great, but make sure you check his earlier stuff out as its way better."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"A drug bust goes awry when five expert gunmen kill both criminals and police, and make off with the drugs and money.Benny Chan's last movie borrows from cops and robbers movies everywhere including Heat, Infernal Affairs, and Hard Boiled. There's even a stylistic shout out to the greasy hair and erratic behaviour of the Joker. The resulting mash-up should be a mess, but great story pacing and action scenes save it. It's action packed and enjoyable, with backstory exposed gradually. Just don't overanalyse it.Nicholas Tse steals the show as the damaged villain, hounded by the bland veteran policeman played by Donny Yen.The story suffers because of the hero's lack of character arc. Blame the need for clear goodies and baddies.Notably using Cantonese instead of Mandarin, and slick but blatant moralising, this movie delivers the local PR boost the Hong Kong Police needs in 2020."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,If you like Asian action movies you will love Raging Fire! Donnie the Superstar / Martial Artist puts in a solid performance in a well done Action Firefighting!!A real badass action film of a special kind simply great and non-stop action !! BRAVO.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,Love the story line and performance of Nicholas Tse.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Perhaps this is Donnie Yen's best movie. From beginning to end the movie was suspenseful and unpredictable. Great story line, really good acting, and great fight scenes."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Something from a different culture, different this time means bad, stupid, etc..a five years old child write better dialogues...screenplay came from the early 80s....action is pretty good, but acting, writng is y categorie, or maybe zTwo hours is far too long, try something better, but be aware avoid Ambulance which is even worse than this 'movie'"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,Resally boring and you know whats about to happen well before you see it on screen.. theres no good fighting at all and its just boring af2/10 at best.
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"I watch this movie twice, the 1st time I just opened my TV & this movie is playing, watch it for few mins-1+ hourish, impressed with the motor-car chase also LoLing because of the cartoonish cgi in that chase & how DYen turn to toreto in FF when he save kid crossing the street.Then watch some & feel kinda cringe bout that guy got bomb & DYen wife got handcuff together storyline plot.Fell asleep in between the 1st watching (the main reason why I turned on the TV in the 1st place)Decide to re-watch the movie again properly from start the next day & I'm impressed, anyway the -2 is because of that cartoonish cgi & whatever cringed bomb save wife & dont wanna kill that guy scene. Also could cut another star but this movie definitely more than 6/10. Probably 7/10 if you can forgive the chinese actors kinda wooden acting & the feeling wasn't gettin thru the audience.But NTse definitely a top notch actor, you can feel his pain & wrath on why he turned bad, also charisma & charm, kinda intelligent badguy. Probably 1 of few chinese actor that I interested to watch movie if he's in it.Gone have the days of golden HK chinese movie; jackiechan, stephenchow & all we get now is expensive high budget movie that got style but lacking substance.This movie definitely on my positive side because I've watch tons of worse chinese movie than this."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,Nicholas tse a fantastic actor performed a Justice devil Avenger. Look forward part 2 Nicholas Tse be back for more revenge..lol..likes!!
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"If you havent seen this movie, it´s a must watch. Very suspenseful.. The plot here is a lot like the last 2 ending episodes from Flash Point: SRU.(AN American Tv series about officers). A good cop, following orders off the books, gone bad, cause his superior officer threw him under the bus, and took credit saving their target, all the while the team he had task to go and save their target(apart from Donnie himself) was thrown into jail. It´s a telling story of a former Police team that was discarded by their former superior, and locked up. The villain basically feels that everyone who was SUPPOSED to be helping them, turned against them, and no one was there to protect them. While in jail EVERY Criminal they ever locked has beaten them down, and turn them into who they are. A group of good cops gone bad, cause Their former superior got greedy."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"If you are looking for a great action film this is very good. Well directed, well acted. Final action scene very reminiscent of Heat but don't let that put you off it is a highly enjoyable film."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Benny Chan Really Directed Very Well, Before He Passed Away. Sad That The Ex-Cops, Were Following Orders, And Ended Up In Prison, Because The Management Wants To Save Face. Donnie Yen And Nicholas Tse Acted Very Well."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Brilliant from start to finish, ignore the nay sayers, I think they actually wanted to watch ""Raging flower"" but got a little confused.Thank you Benny, RIP brother 🙏"
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Excellent execution of action choreography and stunts sequences. Storyline predictable but makes up for cameo appearances of many familiar faces in HK dramas.Great acting from Nic Tse - tensed and believable character. His talent and star persona makes this film one of his signature. Cool, suave and engaging on screen with his twisted justice rendition.All in all, an engaging action packed movie. Kudos to director Benny Chan for this outstanding masterpiece. Respect, gratitude and admiration for the man that he was and the art that he mastered. A defining legend in remembrance."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,"Pro: Decent fight scene.Cons: Very immature story, certainly just a cliché. Rudimentary shooting. Totally nonsense with most of the scenes. Fake special effect. Definitely a big waste of time."
怒火 重案,Raging Fire (2021),,2021,2021.08.13,This movie is freaking awesome! Those people who give low rating for this movie are completely ridiculous and doesn't understand the movie. Action and story line was perfect and makes perfect sense. One of the greatest cop movie in top rank for sure. Love it.
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Though this is a ""heroic epic"" telling of the Golden Age of China, director Ping He does an outstanding job of blending depth of character with period- and action-realism within only 115 minutes.The springboard/wire-fighting is kept to a minimum and is subtly crafted. These are heroes who have skills far beyond the ordinary, and the fighting effects merely convey that without rubbing it in or going over the-top.Every major character is developed in this story except for the young monk, and you'll understand why at the end. We even spend a little time with Lai Qi's 3 loyal soldiers and their families, getting to understand what they've been doing and what is important to them.The plot does involve a magical object, but there are only two scenes with associated special-effects, which were as nicely done as any Hollywood CGI. The first time, it is essential to developing the story and our understanding of why these men will fight so hard to protect it. The second time, only to establish its proper role in the epilogue.There is a hint of a love-story, which I find unnecessary in films like these, but I didn't moan or groan here because it is kept deep in a minor subplot and used primarily to demonstrate that the protagonist is not truly a criminal or a bad man. Not that Ping He doesn't know how to tell a good love story, as he did brilliantly in 1994's ""Red Firecracker, Green Firecracker"" (Pao Da Shuang Deng). I think he was forced to add it, and simply relegated it to the lowest priority.I don't understand how someone could like ""Jet Li: Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger..."" better than this film, unless they have little taste for dramatic, action-adventure epics, and must have a perfectly happy-ending every time. I thank thee, Buddha, that Hollywood hasn't taken over the Chinese film-making industry!"
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"I liked this movie but I was not awestruck by it. It has some excellent characters and a very engaging plot. There are a few lines that will make all but the most jaded filmwatchers smile.But this movie has a couple of drawbacks which mark it as a notch below other films like ""Crouching Tiger"" and the infinitely superior ""Hero."" Both of these films also had excellent characters and stories but were visually far a cut above. A BIG cut.""Warriors"" uses jump-cuts and too-tight camera angles in an effort to hide the fact that many of its stars are not actually martial artists. The resulting fight scenes are very frustrating to watch. Like I said, the plot carries the movie along and it is indeed a good film, but I hate getting snookered by creative editing.Compare any fight scene in ""Warriors"" with, say, the extended battle scene between the two women warriors in ""Crouching Tiger,"" most of which is filmed in medium shots that allow your eye to follow the line of action. IMHO this is a lot more impressive. Even the goofy wire work doesn't take away from that. But ""Warriors"" is worth a rent. You will care what happens to the characters. And you will see a very nice meditation on the question of what, as people of honor, we must do."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Warriors of Heaven and Earth is a decently made movie with some good plot developments. The fighting scenes. All of the fighting scenes were done relatively well, being more towards the real side of battle, instead of the fighting scenes from the other big names (Hero, House of Flying Daggers). My only complaint with the action scenes, is that nobody is affected by the death of their comrades. I understand you cannot stop fighting unless you want to join your brother in heaven, but they all took their deaths as the grim reality. I suppose in a way, it is more realistic (we're all going to die anyway, maybe he was lucky to get to heaven sooner). The camera work and plot however did do an excellent job of making you feel sorrowful when a character died.The romance. Wait, excuse me, romance? Vicky Zhou? What?This point nearly ruined the movie for me until I got back into the mindset of hey, there are good fight scenes, let's enjoy them. Vicky Zhou's character is completely extraneous and was a waste. Although her voice is nice as the narrator of the story, and she still has a pretty face, she was utterly useless. Not only did she not fight (unless you call the one to two minute scene in the end ""fighting""), she had about 10-15 minutes of full, on-camera footage - mostly devoted to questioning Li's criminal activities.Overall. Lai Qi (Kiichi Nakai) and Li Zai (Wen Jiang) carry the entire movie. It's interesting that Jiang is not in the credited cast as he probably had the most screen time in the entire movie.Should you see it? There are a couple things to take into account. 1) If you're not used to HK films, this isn't a good one to start with, unless you abhor the Chinese humor in older less epic films 2) It will probably make you depressed. Maybe it's just me... What else has made me depressed you might ask? Let's see: So Close, Hero, House of Flying Daggers...I give it a 7 out of 10. I had hoped for something slightly better, but then again, it was realistic and the final battle scene reminded me of what the LOTR battle for Helm's Deep would have been if the good guys hadn't all survived -- Classic."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Before reviewing the film, I must point out that although I love Asian films, I generally dislike films like CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON and THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN. That's because special effects take center stage and they are, in my opinion, completely ridiculous and over-the-top. They are so unbelievable that it ruins the pictures for me. Now I know MANY like these films, so I know this statement isn't going to be too popular. But, to me there is a big difference between ""suspension of belief"" and ""suspension of common sense and the laws of physics"".That is why I really liked this film so much. While it does use some of the amazing stunt-work like the other two films, it does not use stunt-work to replace the plot AND the stunts are much more sedate in manner. Yes, they are a little far-fetched but not nearly to the same level.Instead, the true stars of the movie are the locations, camera work, acting and script. And, the overall package is great. How the movie has achieved a ranking of about 6.5 on IMDb is beyond me, as it is perhaps the best Chinese epic film I have ever seen."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"This is not a Kung Fu action movie, so those looking for fight scenes will be disappointed. It is a thrilling story of two warrior knights acting under their own sense of honor and called to action in circumstances beyond their control, against the backdrop of the turbulent and multi-cultural Silk Road. China being the vast country it is has birthed many such thrilling adventures of wandering warriors, itinerant mercenaries, Buddhist monks and pretty maidens. Think of romance or adventure novels based on the Middle Ages! The thrill of the story is to watch the two warriors meeting, one supposedly as the imperial agent sent to eliminate the renegade and intent on his mission, the other as the free agent warrior trying to live a life according to his own personal code of honor. When the two of them unite to fight hordes of greedy bandits, we see hand to hand combat, pursuits on horseback and sieges of a fort.The unusual angles in this movie, for most movie goers, comes from the time and place: the warriors are from 700 A.D, a T'ang Dynasty era. The location is in the far western reaches of China and the locales are not traditionally ""Chinese"". The landscapes change from mountainous to woodsy to desert. There are thrilling scenes of camel caravans and desert towns and forts. The protagonists wear battle gear and the long hair of that period, which remind me vividly of French and English knights and crusaders of that era! The final siege of the desert fort reminds of the male warrior bonding in desperado scenes like in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""; or the ""Alamo""; or the ""Three Musketeers"".The Buddhist relic transported by the caravan reminds me of the Catholic relics from dead saints found in many mystery or adventure stories based on the Middle Ages. The finale reminds me of the movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when the bad guys seem to be on the edge of acquiring the treasure, only to be annihilated, leaving some of the good guys to move on...It is great entertainment and gives one yet another view of the Chinese culture about warriors of its complex past."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"This movie is the story of an Imperial Agent sent to bring to justice a murderer, his final mission before he is allowed to go home to his family in Japan. The murderer, a former army officer accused of mutiny when he refused to kill a group of women and children.  The movie is the tale of their trek across the desert fighting against each other and with each other.  The dialog was great, short and delivered impeccably by an incredible cast of characters. It has been a long while since I have seen such thoughtful, dramatic acting.  The movie is shot mostly in the desert but it is all done beautifully and with exactly the right tone and feel.  I enjoyed the period costumes and the fight scenes were extremely well choreographed. It is seldom that I watch a hollywood movie and come away feeling satisfied, I can only hope that Asia continues to pump out incredible movies like this one and that Hollywood will wise up and stop trying to feed me drivel like the Last Samurai."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"I really enjoyed this movie.Do not expect ""hero"" or ""house of Daggers"" type quality but do expect a ripper of a Chinese B movie.Amazingly charismatic leads in this movie with special mention going to Xueqi Wang and Kiichi Nakai.The action is very good,the fighting choreographic fairly well done without over the top gore or violence and no wire work.What will keep you to the end of this movie is the acting not the action.The basic story is about a Imperial Agent wishing to return home, but first he must bring back or kill a renegade solider.While hunting him down the two are forced to unite for the greater good of a caravan being attacked by bandits.***mild hint of a spoiler here****This was very good up until the end,it took a bit of a supernatural twist.It was like they project ran out of money or steam and they just needed to finish it.Still very very good in-spite of a weakish ending."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Everything that makes for a great Action Adventure film can be found in Warriors of Heaven and Earth.  Chemistry between actors, excellent music, directing and cinematography, and a good story combine with some decent action sequences to make this tale of warriors a memorable one.Fans of Gladiator, The Four Feathers, or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragonshould enjoy this.  Solid if understated special effects and and some excellent dramatic moments with a few surprises along the way make Warriors of Heaven and Earth a beautiful experience to behold. As for Sound if you Can't see it in theatres... at least try to see it with an AC3 or THX/Dolby Surround System the sound and music is worth it!If 100 is perfection this gets a solid 90."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"This film was a really great surprise. The characters were a lot of fun without being goofy or two-dimensional, and the story was complicated enough to be interesting without being overwrought and confusing. The locations were beautiful, and the costuming was great, too. The action was practically non-stop -- lots of chases and sword fights. It didn't have any of the hokey mysticism that so often appears in films like this (although there was a lot of acrobatic swordplay), opting instead for a grittier approach (with a notable exception or two). Definitely worth seeing."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Warriors of heaven and earthThis is an excellent film. While I do not personally think it is as good as Hero I can see why the film commission in China choose this film as it's official selection. This film is somewhere in between the magic and fantasy of Hero and brutal realism of MUSA. The Wire-fu is kept to a minimum only used to slightly punctuate certain scenes. There is a element of fantasy but it does not make it'self apparent in every frame of the film.The acting was good, the battles were pretty good. Personally however if you had not seen either and were thinking about a film to buy I would suggest MUSA. The most major complaint I had with this film was the costumes some times looked a little corny.One last thingWhile the marketing department tried to sell the lead female role as a woman warrior empowered much like the characters of Crouching tiger or Hero don't buy it. She is window dressing and while her characters has awesome dramatic and story potential is mostly wasted."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,I knew nothing of this movie before I watched it.I wish people would stop comparing every single Asian film to CTHD. The film is not trying to be CTHD or better it. It is trying to be something different from the wire-fu extravaganzas that are coming out of China.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film. Certainly one of the better Asian films to be released in recent years. It's not perfect but I found it to be entertaining and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates simple adventure yarns. The story is simple but why should stories be complex to be good? The best stories are often simple ones.Go and see it but don't expect a wire-fu spectacle and you won't be disappointed.
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Very similar in theme to a Western, including absolutely stunning scenery of Chinese desert mountain ranges and lush pine forests like those often seen in cowboy movies. A bunch of retired war buddies loyally follow their ex-commander on one last mission to protect a mysterious caravan journeying to the capital. The positive points about the film include the charming performances from Wen Jiang as the leader, Kiichi Nakai as the Imperial agent and Deshun Wang as 'Old Die-hard' who really lend the picture some gravitas and show total commitment to their performances. Xueqi Wang is especially good as an arrogant villain, his dead blue-eyed stare evoking cold menace. As others have mentioned, the scenery is stunning, with lovely shots of camels crossing the desert and horses along rocky plateaus. The film really is a chance to see landscapes ignored by Hollywood. The religious element to the cargo so disdained by other reviewers was a nice little touch, something I did not expect - it had to be an artifact of this nature to raise the stakes and commit the soldiers to protecting it. For those with an interest in Buddhism it is a nice little element. Sadly the Buddhist precept of doing no harm is not followed by the plot when the relics kill the evildoers - perhaps not what Lord Buddha would do. I was also unsure if the monk was supposed to be Shakyamuni Buddha himself? Xueqi Wang's character seemed to recognise him at the end - was he a reincarnation? I had to watch the movie twice to fully understand what was going on - sudden cuts leave out portions of action, explained away by such narration as 'they gave up the chase and we arrived at the fortress' - there's a fair bit of telling rather than showing. The ending is particularly sudden, once the relics dispose of the baddies we aren't even sure which of our heroes are alive - we just suddenly jump to the capital. The fight scenes are frenetic but are deliberately filmed in close shots and in a rapid-fire confusing manner, meaning we are never sure who is fighting whom and who is winning. Most of these problems, I suspect are down to lack of budget or time. The film has beautiful scenery, some very nice locations at desert forts and towns, an interesting visual combination of Chinese and Arab cultures, and an undemanding Western style plot with some nice tense battles and good performances. You don't really care about the characters as individuals, but you want them to succeed."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"I caught this movie a couple of times and found it interesting without being anything exceptional. However, recently I watched it for a third time. Most films, even the good ones, don't really bear a third watching without becoming predictable and stale. But ""Warriors"", I loved the third time. There suddenly seemed to be new subtleties in the dialog and characterization that I hadn't noticed before. Lai Xi (as it's pronounced in the movie, not Lai Qi which sounds like a Chinese dessert) and Lieutenant Li epitomize nobility, honor and dedication of purpose. Wen Zhu is beautiful and demure but with an undercurrent of steel. Master An and his sidekicks are a little bit caricatured as the pictures of evil, but all of the subsidiary characters - One Eyed Eagle, Old Die-hard, Club Ma etc - bring a blend of humor, bravery and loyalty. The fight and battle scenes are terrific without the excesses of, say, House of Flying Daggers or Crouching Tiger. It's been described as a Noodle Western, and I guess that's a good description. I'd regard it as a better example of the Western genre than most of the Cowboys-and-Indian epics produced by Hollywoood.Originally, I'd probably have regarded this as a 6 or 7 out of 10, but after the latest viewing, it gets a 9."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,This movie was just awesome but like any other movie there is always that part of it that you wish was in it. I think the whole movie runs really well and flows wonderfully.I will have to admit that I though after viewing the trailer that it was gonna be like other movies that I have seen recently from Japan. But was wonderfully surprised when it wasn't. The CGI part in the middle of the film looked awesome and was a good idea but it does throw you for a loop considering how the film went. The end was a let down to me but I won't say anything about it since I do believe that if people like this type of film they should see it. The colors are't nearly as bright as let say Hero but don't let it detour you from seeing. It is an awesome film and should be seen by anyone who likes these types of film.
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"I haven't watched a lot of Chinese cinema, but Warriors of Heaven and Earth seems to be part of a uniquely Chinese genre - the martial arts movie that preaches the importance of loyalty to the state.Lai Xi (Nakai Kilchi) is a Japanese warrior who has spent most of his life in China, serving the Emperor with his prodigious skill and strength. Xi has been given two oddly disparate missions. He is to both safeguard an important young woman on her way from the Western regions of China to the capitol, and he's also to hunt down and bring to justice the renowned outlaw ""Butcher"" Li (Jiang Wen). Li was once a solider in the Emperor's army, but he rebelled at being ordered to slaughter unarmed women and children. Li and his loyal men became mercenaries, until Li's men settled down in an isolated village while the ""Butcher"" pursued his destiny alone. Wandering through the desert, Li is saved by a convoy that's taking valuable Buddist artifacts to the imperial capitol. Xi and Li finally meet, and after a brief sword fight, Xi agrees to allow Li to escort the convoy to the Emperor and only kill him after that mission is complete. But, both Xi and Li have to save the convoy from Master An (Wang Yuengi), who seeks the convoy's artifacts to help his Turkish allies control China's Western regions. Through combat, deprivation and hopelessness, Xi and Li fight onuntil the story ends with a rather strange, ""Look! It's magic"" conclusion.The first thing to know about this film is that it is not a wildly exaggerated, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", people-flying-through-the-air-with-super-powers martial arts movie. There are a couple of moments of so-called ""wire-fu"", but this is a much more realistic adventure and I think it's the better for it. Some people really get off on the intricately complex, ballet-like conventions of modern martial arts films, but I prefer action scenes that bear some resemblance to what can happen in actual life.There are certain aspects of the story that don't make sense or don't seem to hang together that well, but this is a foreign film so it's hard to tell if anything is actually missing or if I am just missing certain cultural or social themes that a Chinese audience would easily recognize.Even with all that, there's some good acting here. Jian Wen and Nakai Kilchi create very different characters without big scenes to show off in. Lai Xi has a decidedly aristocratic air to him, while ""Butcher"" Li is a solider much more used to the muddy trench. Several of the other characters are also allowed some depth.The theme of loyalty to the state running through Warriors of Heaven and Earth isn't something you see much in cinema from other countries. Loyalty is usually something between individuals, not between a person and a ruling government. Yet, I've seen a few Chinese films that strongly stress the nobility, honor and necessity of sacrificing oneself for the betterment of the nation. It's a very communitarian, as opposed to individualistic, concept of heroism.Warriors of Heaven and Earth is a pretty straight-forward adventure tale that's enjoyable on its own, but it also might teach you a little bit about modern Chinese cultureor at least the culture that's being propagated at this particular time."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"one of the best Chinese movie watched in year, much better than Hero (ying xong) or a few other titles..... for whose of you who gave it low ratings, i don't know if you have understood the story, background or culture of this movie. or just watched it for its fighting part?"
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Warriors of Heaven and Earth is an interesting film due to the fact that it had so many great elements that just didn't come together. The cast was fine, the setting and backdrop were fine, the outline of the story was interesting, but the ingredients of this picture did not mix.The problem with the film was timing, budget, and the script.Excellent Cast including Jiang Wen, Kiichi Nakai, and Vicki Zhao. Beautiful Scenery of the Gobi Desert and the far reaches of China.The problem was the script. It was clichéd and most of all boring. There was nothing unique, in fact the dialog seemed taken from other films. You have the two guys that are suppose to be opponents who become buddies (aka 48 Hours)who take on an evil warlord and his thugs and defeat them in Battle. The supporting cast (the other warriors) get picked off one by one like (The Magnificent Seven).Vicki Zhao has a meaningless role in the film. It is pretty much just stand around and look pretty and helpless and do a little narration work while you are at it. If you have Vicki Zhao in a film, you should use her. They made her character as clichéd and one dimensional as possible.This film can't compare to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Musa"", or ""House of Flying Daggers"". It is what you call a big budget B movie. The fight scenes look uncoordinated as well. After watching the ""How the Film was made"", I was a little more sympathetic towards the director. The Director Ping He had a daunting task of getting the film made due to weather and the timeline. I think he did not have enough time or money to do this film right. It was just too massive of an undertaking given the time constraints. It looked very rushed and disorganized.The scenery and the backdrops are breathtaking, actually the highlight of the movie, the script itself was weak. The most memorable moment in the film is the scenery and Vicki Zhao in the bathtub. Now that was some nice scenery too."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Spoilers`Warriors' is intend to be the Chinese movie that will follow the footsteps of Crouching Tiger and Heroes to next year's Oscar contest for best foreign film.Before going to a synopsis, allow me to start from the middle of the movie and explain my summary line. This is a scene when the three main characters converge in an ambush, and we see separate shots of them on horseback, clad in red, black and white respectively. This was the point when I made the association to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Eli Wallach respectively), even though the match may not be perfect. The Good is one-time army captain Li (JIANG Wen), now hunted by the government for his refusal to slaughter women and children. The Bad is Lai Xi (NAKAI Kiichi), the government agent charged with the assignment of killing the Good before he his allowed to return to his native Japan to see his mother. The Ugly is bandit leader Master An (WANG Zueqi) who is being manipulated by the Turkish empire to go after certain treasure. Watching the three wielding their respective weapons, a Chinese army sabre, a Japanese sword and a curved Islamic sword, I had another thought. If I were to cast them from Hollywood, my choice would be Russell Crowe, Morgan Freeman and Johnny Depp respectively.Some of the other characters are:The Girl (Vicki Zhao from `Shaolin Soccer') - a general's daughter that the Bad is escorting back to the capital cityThe Monk - on an imperial mission, in a caravan travelling to the capitalThe Soldier - escorting the MonkThe Four - the Good's former subordinates, loyal as everThe Old Man and the Boy - fighters recruited by the GoodNow to the synopsis. I'm trying to divide the story into chapters (the original idea is not from Kill Bill, as there have been numerous examples before).1. The build-up.This is the longest part, taking its time in introducing the various characters. We see the three warriors, on separate occasions, display their awesome skills. The main story line develops when surviving a killer sandstorm, the Good runs into the caravan, and agrees to help out on this treacherous journey. On a short sojourn in a quiet village, the Good refuses help offered by the Four, in consideration for their families. While enlisting the Old Man and the Boy, he has his first encounter with the Bad whom he persuades, after some brief parrying, to back off until he has seen the caravan safely to the capital.2. The trapIn their attempt to recruit more help, the Good and the Old Man wander into a small walled village that looks more like a maze than anything else. There, the Ugly is waiting, with two alternatives he has to offer: recruit his men or turn the caravan over to him. Upon the Good's refusal, the gates are all slam shut, and a fight ensues. Dodging pursuit in an attempt to get out of the trap, the Good is greeted by the sudden appearance of the Girl and the Bad, offering their help. Before he has time to respond to the offer, however, his four loyal followers crash into the skirmish from out of nowhere. While the Good and his followers finally break out of the trap and ride back to the caravan, the Bad confronts the Ugly, daring him to challenge the authority of the Imperial Emperor, which he represents. The Ugly backs off, vowing to come back.3. The ambush and the revelationReinforced by the Good's four loyal followers, the caravan moves on, only to meet an ambush by the Ugly and his bandits. Recognising that the caravan is on an imperial mission, the Bad and the Girl come to their aid. After a bout of exciting engagement on horseback, the caravan retreats through a narrow gorge and finally goes into hiding a cavern not unlike Moria in Lord of the Rings (but not as grand). There, the Monk finally reveals the secret. He is carrying the utmost treasure, the crystallised remains of Buddha, back to the capital, and this is what the Ugly, with the Turkish Empire behind him, is after. Recognising the gravity of the situation, the Good sends the Boy home while keeping the Old Man in his service.4. The gambleTemporarily safe in the hidden cavern, the group, including the Bad and the Girl, debates various alternative routes. The final decision is to brave the Gobi Desert, gambling on the Old Man's accurate recollection of the location of an underground stream. On they move in the punishing heat into the scouring desert. Their supply of water has dwindled to a critical low when the Old Man proclaims that they are getting close to the underground stream. There the camp, and send out the Old Man and one of the Four to look for the stream. The Ugly's pursuit however has caught up with them. Mobilising into a circular formation just like wagons in a Hollywood Western, the caravan fights off the first round of savage attack. But the elements are against them as their supply of water finally runs out and the searches return with the heartbreaking news that the underground stream is nowhere to be found. All seem lost, despite the gallant effort of the Good and the Bad in the furious fight against the fatal onslaught, when something skin to a miracle occurs. Struck down by several enemy blades, the Old Man plunge his sword into the ground, from which water first gushes, then shoots out in a ten-foot fountain. Life comes back in full vitality to the caravan while the Ugly, reading this as a heavenly sign, calls a hasty retreat.5. The last standThis `chapter' is reminiscent of The Alamo. Making it to a miserably primitive fortress means only a brief reprieve to the caravan. In addition to the bandits, the full fury of an entire Turkish army now is close on its heels. Similar to what we see in Seven Samurai or even Saving Private Ryan, the caravan sets up its last defence. Even the Girl trades her white garments for shinning armours, as she is after all a general's daughter. No resistance, no matter how brave, can withstand the crushing weight of an entire army and it looks like everybody will get slaughtered in the desolate fortress, when another miracle happens, Raider-of-the-Lost-Ark fashion. When the Ugly opens the container of the treasure, blinding lights come out, vanquishing the enemy. The toll that has been exacted before the miracle, however, is heavy, including all of the Four, the Monk and even the Bad. The expected climatic duel between the Good and the Bad therefore never materialised. In the end, only the Good and the Girl survive to complete the mission, bringing the treasure back to the imperial palace.So how is the movie? It's inevitable that comparisons will be made with Crouching Tiger. At the risk of sounding ridiculously mystical, I would say that it's a bit like Yin (Tiger) and Yang (Warriors). While the former is subtle and feminine, the later is blunt and masculine. While the former delights with beautifully choreographed action, the latter excites with brutal, realistic fighting. Beyond that, it is difficult to compare because they are so different.The first three-quarters of Warriors are splendidly done. The characters are interesting and the development is well paced. The rugged landscape is invigorating and the brisk dialogue refreshing. The end, unfortunately, falls somewhat apart. I wouldn't grudge being cheated out of a climax of a duel as I respect the producers' intention to stay away from the conventional. The Raider-of-the-Lost-Ark thing, however, is really lame. I would rather see the imperial army coming to the rescue, if an Alamo-type ending is not contemplated."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"How should we call this genre? Chinese film-makers take their rich history and repack it into action movies very much shoot in accordance to the Hollywood action and western movies conventions. If the Clint Eastwood movies of the 6os were spaghetti westerns, these should be noodles westerns, right? The result is quite entertaining, I confess. As a warning, 'Warrior of Heaven and Earth' do not get to the level of 'Tigers' or 'Hero' from a story budding, fights choreography or cinematography. It's what is called in American cinema slang a B movie, but not a bad one. Acting is good, there are good moments of cinema, and I actually enjoyed the fact that the fights avoided this times the physically impossible choreography in some other movies - no jump records broken in this one, no walking on the ceilings and walls, sorry! The less successful parts in Ping He's film are related to some cheap low-budget effects, discontinuities in the story and a tendency to solve conflicts through super-natural effects which are quite in contrast to the down-to-earth tone of the rest of the story. But this may be where the Ewnglish title comes from - the Earth action, and the Heaven dramatic solutions.Worth watching, although not the best in his category. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"This is my second Chinese film after Mulan and I picked it up to see more of the actress Wei Zhao. But I am warming to this genre - yes simple (but reading subtitles the screenplay could not be too complicated or it would be exhausting!). Again I am struck by the superb sets - breathtaking country. This time the similarities with Westerns are palpable - the characters, lines (""Something doesn't feel right""), behaviour all reek of the 'Wild West' and serve to remind us that we humans are basically the same everywhere - and so are our stories - despite superficial variations. But my biggest impression is how the lead hero played by Jiang Wen is so like our own dear Russell Crowe! Deep voice, flat expression, speaking eyes , unflappable calm and stocky build - it's uncanny. Mind you I'm not sure whether RC can wiggle his ears like Jiang! Recommended."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"It's the start of the 8th century. The Chinese Tang dynasty is battling the Turk for the silk road occupied by Buddhist kingdoms. Lieutenant Li tries to release Turk women and children when he's ordered to execute them. He's forced to mutiny and escape. Later, the Tang emperor sends Sir Lai Xi to kill Li who is labeled as 'the butcher'. Lai Xi is Japanese forced to live in the Tang court since age 13. He is promised a passage home after killing Li. The two men fight but join forces to defend a Buddhist caravan. The caravan is carrying a powerful relic and the Turks are after it for control of the local Buddhist tribes. Lord Khan recruits ruthless local warlord Master An who is promised the Khan's daughter.This has good locations of the vast desert landscapes and local settings. The story is relatively simple but a little disjointed. The battles are part-realistic and part-unreal kung fu. There's some good action but also some confused action. This is a watchable action adventure with some good but also some deficiencies."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"""Warriors of Heaven and Earth (Tian di ying xiong)"" is such an old-fashioned, conventional swordplay movie that I expected young Kirk Douglas and Robert Taylor to pop up. This is Cecil B. DeMille with a lot smaller cast.We've seen many times before the charismatic law enforcement guy end up allying with the charismatic not-really-a-criminal he's duty bound to bring in (""Sometimes it's a crime not to kill."") to defeat the bad guy, who literally here is a rasta-braided blue-eyed devil, along with a tribe that I'm not sure our history books would translate as ""The Turks."" The romance is oblique, which is just as well because the seductive miss may not be legal and he's old enough to be her grandfather, but that doesn't prevent a scene as old as the Bible, where the soldier comes upon the maiden in the bath. It does serve as a nice promotion for China's various and impressive movie locations. I'm not sure if it was dubbed that even pre-teen boys would care about this kind of action movie anymore."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Desiring an Oscar?  Even shortlisted...  It's like a rule that most epic movies, namely Gladiator, Lord of the Rings can win the apples of the eyes of the judges.  Why lost?  Maybe the awkward digital animation, computer effect, the unclear storyline or the weak presentation about the Buddhist importance.  But anyway, it's not a Chinese movie or a movie for Chinese. It's a movie to attract the international attention.Well, millions of people fighting in a battlefield, gallons of blood, high decibel of noise, lethal weapons, dexterous martial arts, romance between foes...  When it comes to acting, the Japanese actor Kiichi Nakai was serious to his profession like taking up the language and the martial art training, laudable acting.  Sportingly speaking, Nakai, Xueqi Wang and Yun Zhou (the monk) outperform the main lead Wen Jiang.  He is just writing his signature."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"A Japanese soldier travels across the Gobi to chase a deserter, but they have to join forces against a common enemy to reach their destination.Japanese actor Kiichi Nakai and Chinese actor Wen Jiang lead a brilliant cast that includes Xueqi Wang as leader of the desert bandits and the incredibly beautiful Chinese actress Zhao Wei, who will be appearing with Infernal Affairs actor Tony Leung next year in John Woo's The Battle of Red Cliff. She starred with Leung in Chinese Odyssey 2002.The battles were fierce, but the incredible scenery and special effects are what grabs you as the duel between Kiichi Nakai and Wen Jiang were delayed not only to fight the bandits and the Turks who wanted to control Western China, but to deliver a sacred relic to the Buddists. This relic had special powers that made this film beautiful."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"This movie had all the trappings of a successful film, but was obviously did not come together in editing. Much of the third act was simply not there, and the use of voice-over to advance the plot was an obvious sign of internal problems. The movie as a whole is incredibly uneven, and the sudden inclusion of CGI hoodoo after the half-way point was jarring and unwelcome. Even still, just about all of the plot devices have been done better in other movies. Comparing this movie to Musa, Hero, and CTHD is doing those movies a disservice. While this movie is not bad, nothing raises it above mediocrity."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,So I know the Magnificent 7 was based on Seven Samurai but this is also very similar. A team of oddball warriors team up for one last ride to help out a monk and a convoy of camels to deliver and protect a precious and powerful religious artefact. The action sequences were great. Not too much use of CGI and most of the fight and battle scenes seemed quite realistic. The filming locations and cinematography was breathtaking. The desert looked beautiful and I especially liked the mountain lake setting. The characters were all quite likeable also and you could really root for the hero. My only gripe was the religious artefact back story. It gave flashes of moments which suggested the relic was powerful but we never really found out much about it and what its powers could do. Anyway a really good movie that I highly recommend.
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"I first saw the making of this movie on AXN and thought it would be a great film. It had some major stars and the location looked beautiful. Considering I had worked in that part of the world for a year, I knew how it felt like in the summer heat and winter cold.The story is a simple one with a renegade soldier being hunted by an emperor's Japanese emissary. The renegade soldier is in charge of escorting a Buddhist artifact and they get hounded by bandits in the desert. The emissary and renegade predictably band together to save the artifact from the bandits.After watching the film I was disappointed with the story and how it panned out. I thought the fighting sequences were ordinary and the last part of the story a cop out. I think the whole film could have been done much better with a better script and the fighting choreographed much better. My low voting mark reflects this disappointment."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Personally I think it's a rip off of Musa, but besides that, it does a terrible job of developing characters. You feel no attachment to any of them. Vicki Zhao was did nothing except play eye candy. You didn't know exactly what was going on until at least 45 minutes into the movie, and the main villain was absolutely laughable. There were scenes that were stuck there for no apparent reason at all. Either He Ping rushed this, or he had to clip out practically half the movie to make budget.Poorly developed characters and storyline. Even the music seemed inappropriate or cheesy at times. The only redeeming grace of this movie is its extraordinary cinematography. That and an attempt to add some symbolism in the movie with water and blood.Terrible movie. Not worth your money or time. If you want the same style but awesome story/characters, go for Musa."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Reading all the reviews they covered most of the relevant points. The thing about this film it is not a kung fu movie, it's not about demonstrating the great skills of kung fu, so I think it is a bit unfair to compare it to the movie Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House Of Flying Daggers. And the characters are not meant to be martial artists but swordsman, which is a totally different skill set. I would compare this more to road movies, because it is more of a road movie, (where characters physical moving through an environment is symbolic of the character's inner change.) If your looking for a movie with amazing battle scenes this is not it. It's a character driven movie, about ethical and moral dilemmas, loyalty and honour and the bonds of brotherhood. For me what blew me out of the water was the acting, it's been a long time since I've seen demeanor acting like that. I don't know if it was perfect casting or perfect directing but the main actors looked completely involved in their character, in the way they moved , the way they walked even just sitting in a chair you'd think that is how that character would sit in the chair. They got all the nuances right never once you thought that's the actor coming through. Been a long time since I've seen acting that particular. My only real gripe, is if you are going to get a Japanese actor to play the Japanese character, couldn't you get Turks to play Turks? Or at least someone more passable for Turkish because Chinese looks nothing like Turkish."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Came across this movie looking for something else and thought I would give it a watch. The storyline was decent enough and not too confusing with an interesting look at individual's commitments to their beliefs and their journey and how they dealt with changes to their commitment once situations changed. It was not your typical Chinese action movie and was located in some beautiful areas, with the scenery and imagery quiet nice. Costumes where nice and suited the characters being portrayed. The only thing that could have been done better where the combat scenes, which had a lot to do with the way they were filmed, the view was quite close so made for some confusion by the viewer. Still it was nice to see the resistance to the usual highly choreographed fight scenes."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"There is only one word to describe this movie, dull. Dull plot, dull acting, dull special effects and dull fighting scenes. I saw other highly rating reviews, mostly 10 stars, but after watching it, what a waste of time. Different people has different taste, but this one is definitely not my cup of tea. This movie focuses too much on the characters, but there are nothing exciting about these characters, they are really boring. I should stick to the Xmen, cheesy movies like this one really put me to sleep. It's very disappointing. Anyone who wishes for a better epic movie should consider the 90s ""Once Upon a Time in China"" or ""Fong Sai-Yuk"" series if they haven't seen them already."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Read at your own risk. Don't waste your good money watching it. This movie just reaffirmed my decision not to watch Hero. I had the chance and figured it would be Americanized with implausible plots. One of the aspect I enjoyed was the cinematography. In one scene, the camera looked up at Lieutenant Li reminiscent of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. Parts of the sound track was enjoyable, more so if father dearest didn't open his mouth and buries the good dialogue way way below the obnoxiously loud music. Dear Ping He, please watch either volume of Kill Bill and learn how to mix soundtracks. Finally about the second viewing, my ears adjusted and picked up the words. I suppose the slightly jarring music was a foreshadowing of the sloppy weaving of the story leaving gaping holes where the audience is left to fill them in. For example, what is the Japanese doing at the military post? what was the relationship between Japan and Tang Dynasty? Wen Zhu (played by beloved formerly saucy Huan Zhu Ge Ge) didn't receive a decent chance to break out of the pretty girl mold. Instead, poor dear was reduced to narrate the obvious like when they were sneaking of the Big Steed Post (their translation, not mine), ""Lai Qi spotted them heading for Red Rock Gorge. He didn't want the bandit steal the caravan, nor does he want Li killed until they reach the capital."" (not word for word) This is only slightly less painful than Legolas stating ""those are orc horns."" Bah!I can't say that I know the costume from Tang Dynasty but the helmets look suspiciously like shiny plastic. I could be wrong. I could also be wrong but half way through the movie, there were more camels than they started with. The key parts of the journey cuts through the desert. If they were true desert people, even with wells, Master An would not give water/spit at Lai Qi, nor would the girl take a luxurious bath. And what is with the mysticism of the pagoda? If the plot is believable and characters true to their environment, anything valuable could replace the pagoda. Anyone who thinks this is good need to watch Chinese television series Yang Jia Jang about the rise and fall of a family of warriors serving their emperor. Or San Quo Yang Ye/Tale of Three Kingdoms."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"Wow, such a waste of time. I had to stop in the middle. The actors performed just bad. The characters introduction was a total joke. The costumes looked so fake. There's historical errors in the props. The sound effects weren't convincing. The plot didn't capture me at all. The CGI looked totally laughable. And the soundtrack felt like a copy of Titanic. The English overdub is a total catastrophe.One of the most laughable scene is the sandstorm. They are in the desert, suddenly a huge CGI sandstorm appears out of nowhere. Everybody runs in a circle for 10 seconds. Next cut everything disappeared and a guy is yelling for the others. I've seen high school kids with better dramaturgic talent than what I've seen in this movie.I did like the performance of the many animals in the movie. And the scenery was very watchable. But the rest was getting in the way of enjoying, so only 2 stars."
天地英雄,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (2003),,2003,2004.09.03,"well,I seen this movie just now,the first impression is the scene and action.we talk about the scene first.if you had seen Directed Ping He's forepart movie,you'll know the movie <<Shuang-Qi-Zhen daoke>>(english title is the swordman in double flag town.but ""DAOKE"" in chinese it means the blade man[a use blade's fighter]),it show the west of china's view and action.in this movie,is show west too.TIAN DI YING XIONG's scene hugeness,and costume is beautiful,character background preciseness.second is the action,the action is great,very without further ado,is an other genre's action,different to WO HU CANG LONG and YING XIONG.they are pay attention to action vision,but it was inauthenticity.TIAN DI YING XIONG's action is true-life,the action vision it was good too(but it was an other genre's action,you must accept it).ok,i must talk about disadvantage.story & film editing is bad!crassitude story and film editing!if they was good,i will vote this film 8/10,but now i just can vote this film 6 or 7/10!because maybe international edition is different to chinese edition,so i just say that all."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"I only chance upon this precious gem of a film from China while watching the DVD extra features of a Hong Kong film. Director Carol Lai talked about how she came to select actor Liu Ye in her film ""The Floating Landscape"" 2003. I caught her mentioning the film ""Nashan Naren Nagou"" (aka ""Postmen in the Mountains) and I checked it out. It was a remarkable surprise - I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Its positive energy never thrust at you, but just be, and at times touching that would bring a heartwarming smile and tear simultaneously.It may appear to be a simple film about the life of a postman who delivers mail in the rural mountains, but there's a lot more than meets the eye. And what a feast for the eye: the scenery is amazing and the cultural folklore enchanting. The simplicity (ease) of it all: direction, storytelling, cinematography, editing with sound and music flowing with the natural performances become an integral whole. The depth of varying emotions between father and son, mother and son, father and mother (in nostalgic flashbacks), father and the dog (affectionately called: the 'second son') - more than subtly reveals through the son's narration and realization how much the postman job means to his father and the people he served all these years. It's no simple story after all - a maturing journey where the son and the father grew to appreciate each other, strengthened their bond and increased their love of the family's central 'pillar' - the mother/the wife in their lives. The storyline is the staple of Asian culture.As you go on this journey with the central characters, you will be rewarded more than hundredth fold. ""That mountain, that man, that dog"" - the literal translation of the Chinese title of the film comes as naturally and gently as the film is delivered. ""Postmen in the Mountains"" is not to be missed. It's available on DVD in Chinese with English subtitles. (If I remember right, it even featured a tune in English somehow.)"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"The story is simple. Only it is not. A son is taking over the postman job of his father, who is forced to retirement due to arthritis. And on his first day of job, the father walks along to show him the rope (literally). The job is simple, they walk uphill 80 kilometers a day for two days, and back down 80 kilometers on the third day, dropping off and picking up mails in the villages along the way. Yet the job is not that simple at all, the postman's job involves a lot more than just simply delivering mail, he also need to know the relationships amoung the villagers by heart. The story revolves around the relationship between the father and son. It is not a rebellion relationship typically seen in western movies, the son already appreciates the sacrifice his father has to make, considering the father is one of the only few literates in the area, yet he spents almost 30 years delivering mail on foot, often away from home for months - it is a great sacrifice (there's a scene late in the film which the son tells his father what needs to be done in their own village, and you realize that the father has been away from home for so long that he knows little about it). But this time, the son truely experiences and understands the difficulty of the job. The last few scenes of the film tells that even though the father may not have spend much time with his son, he could trust no one but him for the job, and you understand why his son, who could probably spent his life in the cities, takes his job at the beginning of the film.Sometimes funny, but mostly touching, the subtle but deep bond between the father and son is very well acted.Great cinematagraphy, well suited for the subtle tone of the film.There are many little bits that would be lost to the westerners if translated in English. For example, the Chinese title of the film is ""Those Mountains, Those People, That Dog"", refering to their trusted family dog, a constant companion on the road. The name of the dog (in English dub is apparently Bingo), is ""Lao Er"", an often used term to descript the second son of the family. Even so, if it had a wider release in the states, I truely believe that it would win a lotta awards."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"The story looks as simple as it can be. It is simply a record of the journey of two postmen in the mountains, father, son and their dog. The father is retiring and the son is taking over the job, with the help of their dog Buddy, who has been helping all along. But wait...If you enjoy the docudrama style of ""Not One Less"" by Zhang Yimou, you will love this movie. It makes use of similar techniques but to an even more superb level. It does not attempt to 'tell a story', but simply lets the facts, conflicts and feelings unfold as the journey of the father and son goes on. It is so 'real' that even the names of the characters were not mentioned, they are just 'the postman', 'the son' as people would address them. (And as you would address your postman.)The 'son' is one of the very few Chinese actors in recent Chinese cinema with cute looks and top quality acting. All the other actors did a great job as well.The cinematography is excellent, especially when compared to most Chinese movies where lighting is poor. But this is not too surprising, knowing that the director had been an Art Director before.The movie was based in the early 80's in China, and I just wonder if they are still using the same methods to distribute mail. Anyway I would like to pay my respect to all mail staff who have taken part in the difficult process of helping people  communicate with each other, making the world a smaller and happier place."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"Lovely, sentimental film about life transitions for a father (Ten Rujun) and his young adult son (Liu Ye), set against a background of almost achingly beautiful landscapes photographed in the mountains of Hunan Province in south central China.The time is the present, and the father, though only in his early 40s, is no longer physically able to conduct his torturous postal route made on foot, carrying a huge mail pack deep into the mountains. He has arranged for his son to inherit his job.A vital member of the operation is the family dog, a precocious German Shepard who refuses to go out on the route with the son: it's too radical a departure from custom. So the father must also make the son's inaugural trip with him, to get the dog to go along. It's a good thing, too. Because there is much for the young man to learn that the dog alone could not have taught him.For example, there is a blind woman living on an isolated farm who gets letters from her son living in the city. Actually he only sends money, never a personal note. So the father has made up letters from him to ""read"" to her over the years. In a small village, everyone turns out and the son can see that his father is deeply revered by the villagers as an important state official and singular link to the larger world.The father also has some lessons to learn from his son, about village life back home, and the wants and needs of his mother, for the father has truly remained a stranger there through the years. The screenplay was adapted from a short story with the delightful title: ""That Postman, That Mountain, That Dog."" The film won the 1999 Chinese Golden Rooster (Jin Ji) awards for best film and best actor (Mr. Ten). It also has been highly popular in Japan. An English subtitled cut was only prepared in 2003 and its distribution in the U.S. began just in mid-autumn, 2004. A gorgeous film about life's passages. (In Mandarin). My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 03/25/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"I was fortunate enough to have a friend in Hong Kong to send me a CD of this film, for which I have to thank him immensely. It is a truly wonderful Chinese movie, and set in the China of the 1970's.The plot, though simple, never fails to hold the attention, and gives a heartwarming insight into the relationship of a father and son getting to know, and learning to appreciate each other after long periods apart during all the years of the boy's upbringing.The father, played by Rujun Ten, is a postman whose route takes him around the mountain of Hunan and away from his family for months at a time. But due to age (and failing legs) he is forced to retire and to hand the job over to his son, played by Ye Liu. This movie is the story of the former showing the latter the mail route, it's ups and downs, with introductions to the mountain people on the way. They are aided in no small way by their faithful German shepherd dog, Buddy.The Chinese scenery is utterly stunning, the cinematography equally so, which is backed up by superbly sensitive and restrained acting by the two main players and also the supporting cast (which includes the dog, a star in his own right).The one downside is that it's possibly a little too slow-paced for most Western tastes, and therefore probably won't get the universal airing it deserves. But for my money ""Nashan naren nagou"" (""The Mountain Postman"") is absolutely unmissable."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"i saw the film during a recently held chinese film festival. i am happy i saw. this is the first film that i saw where the lead characters have no names! 1. the following scenes touched me the most. the father suffers from knee/leg pain. the son arranges the letters, the air blows off the letters. the father DASHES off and the Dog chips in, simply superb.2. The son carries the father on his back across the river. on reaching the father turns away his face from the son to wipe his tears.3. the interplay between the father, the son and the dog when they leave their house on work.i thank the entire team for giving a wonderful movie to enjoy"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"Several months after seeing this film, it still has an impact on me. I can visualise the scene where the son piggy-backs the father across the river, the scene where the son reads the letter to the old lady etc. So little is said in this film, but it is pregnant with meaning. It has been a long time since a film touched me so deeply."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"A postman in the Hunan region is retiring, passing on the role to his son. The route is a gruelling one through the mountains, and Dad's knees can't take the pounding any more. On Son's first day, Dad and dog Buddy accompany him to familiarise him with the route. The job has kept Dad away for long stretches, so Dad and Son use the journey to re-acquaint themselves.The meagre plot is more than compensated for by lush photography, naturalistic acting and keen attention to detail. Son realises his father does more than just deliver mail; he keeps families together, protects the weak and vulnerable, provides guidance to the young. Father realises that his son is a man and has missed having a father over the years. Son hears the story of how his father met his mother on the route - and then gets to enact possibly his own story of pre-destined lovers...You feel as if you are on the mountain paths with these three (the dog is very much a character in the travels). Their journey, both physical and spiritual, speaks to family, belonging, human connection and what the sum of a working life adds to. There is a passing of the baton, a shift from one stage in life to another, for all involved. The dog becomes the symbol for the acceptance of this at the end, in a hugely cathartic visual mise-en-scene. An elegiac and uplifting film, imbibed with humility."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"I was able to see the movie from a local channel that shows art films every week. The film is about a father passing on his work as a postman to his son. It is about family, home, traditions, and relationships. There's so many lessons in life that one would pick up from this movie.There are good character developments especially for the son who got to know and understand more about his father's life. He saw a different side of his father through the people his father delivered letters to. In addition, the people that the father and son encountered along their journey are unique. One would be able to relate to them one way or another.The film showed a lot of cultural traditions and sceneries such as rice fields, stream, mountain roads, sunsets, wedding festivals, traditional houses, weaving, and more. These small details give the film the right feel and atmosphere.One would definitely gain a lot of insights by simply watching the film. The film is a reminder that one should appreciate the small things in life and the things we take for granted."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"Watch out, SOME SPOILERS!!!While seeing this beautiful film I immediately remembered 'Not One Less' by Zhang Yimou which was a film is quite a similar manner as ""Postmen in the Mountains'. The story is about father and his son who is taking over his father's job. The son thinks he already knows everything about his new job and it seemed to be easy for him but during his first days of being a postman he realises what the job is really all about, he has lots of new experiences and meets many new people, perhaps even his new love.There are quite many scenes which being very simple manage to show the essence of humanity and relationships of people. For example as the father and the son are leaving a village they were passing the son is surprised to see a crowd of people staring at them. The father explains that all they came here to see his son - the new postman. Or the scene as the son is carrying his father though a river, or as the son is reading a letter to a blind old woman even though there's nothing written in it... Those moments are the most valuable moments of this film and makes it just beautiful. It's a 10/10"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"The old postman retired and passed the job to his son. Due to his worry, he decided to accompany his son on his maiden journey. In the past they had no much time to stay together because of the time-consuming job. This was a good opportunity for them to communicate. On the road, the son learned the hardship of the job. He also knew much from his father. At the same time, the father felt the strong love from his son.The movie showed us the most beautiful side of human being. Only love can exists forever. We should cherish the people who love us and never be hesitant to show our love to them.RuJun Ten convincingly played the kind father. Although it is Ye Liu's maiden show, his talent was obvious. His later works proved it. He won the best actor (golden horse award) for LanYun was not accidental. Director JianQi Huo did a great job indeed.One of the best Chinese movies. 9/10"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"Truly one of the best films I have ever seen. The landscape scenes are breathtaking. And the calm, balanced development is consuming. There is a peace and a serenity in this film that I can really only compare to what I used to feel when I would take long walks alone along the Chicago lake shore. I've also felt this kind of peace looking out over the Utah Salt Flats from the tops of the Pilot Mountains.I don't know why this film is so hard to find in the U.S. market; all I can surmise is that American distributors are skeptical of the appeal a gentle, beautiful film. In an age, though, where we're bombarded constantly with terror alerts and hard-driving action films, I've got to believe that a film as quietly powerful as this could find audiences who will quickly be enchanted by a rural postman, his son, their dog, and the simple, wonderful villages they deliver the mail to."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"""Postmen in the Mountains"" is set in a rural part of Hunan province, China, during the early 1980s, the period when the modernisers with in the Chinese Communist Party, led by Teng Hsaio-ping, were starting to break down the strict Maoist orthodoxy which had prevailed ever since the 1949 revolution. This remote mountain area, however, does not appear to have undergone much modernisation of any kind, and life still continues as it has done for decades, perhaps even centuries.The two main characters are the local postman and his son. (We never learn their names). Although the father is only in his forties, he is being forced to retire from his job because of arthritis in his knee; the job is a physically demanding one which requires him to walk through the mountains on journeys lasting several days. The young man is taking over his father's position and on his first journey as postman the father accompanies him, together with the family's faithful dog, to show him the route. (The dog is given greater prominence in the original Chinese title, ""Nashan naren nagou"", or ""Those Mountains, Those Men, That Dog"").During the course of their journey, the young man learns about more than the route he needs to follow or the demands of his new job. He also gets to know the villagers who live along the way, many of whom have become close friends of his father. In one village the two are invited to attend a wedding celebration among the Dong people, a local ethnic minority who do not belong to the majority Han Chinese community and speak a different language. Most importantly, the son gets to know his father better; the two were not close during the boy's childhood, as the demands of his job meant that the father was away from home for long periods of time.""Postmen in the Mountains"" is a strongly pictorial film, by which I mean that the emphasis is placed as much upon the visual elements as upon dialogue and physical action. It is shot using longer takes than would be normal today in American or European films; as with many Chinese or Far Eastern films every shot seems to be carefully composed like a painting. There are certainly some Western films that also have this quality- ""Far from Heaven"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" are two recent examples- but it seems to be more common in Asian ones. The photography of the mountain scenery is particularly striking.I caught this film recently when it was shown as part of a cultural festival to mark Chinese New Year in Greenwich, a district of London with a large Chinese community. It was my first introduction to the films of Huo Jianqi, a director with whom I was not previously familiar, although I knew the work of his older contemporaries Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. (Zhang's films in particular are also notable for their pictorial qualities- ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" are good examples). Huo is perhaps less well-known in the West than Chen and Zhang, but on the basis of this film he is an excellent director and brings out two very good performances from his leading actors Ten Rujun and Liu Ye. ""Postmen in the Mountains"" may be too slow paced for some Westerners used to action-packed blockbusters, but I found it a beautiful, wise and serene film about traditional Chinese life and a moving father-son relationship. 8/10"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen (thank you, Nickelodeon in Santa Cruz, CA!). Fell in love with it and couldn't wait for it to hit DVD format. Fast forward a couple years and I rented it for relatives. Alas, it was drained of most of its color and the subtitles were so pale and ruined with gaps you couldn't read them. Given how simple the story is you know they had to be bad if it interfered with that, which it did. Does anyone know if there's since been a better transfer? This movie sure deserves a good presentation. I saw this at a film festival and it's still one of the few non-documentary Chinese productions I've found that illustrate something of the lives of people in rural China, as opposed to the urbanized views we get on the news."
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"One of the few Chinese movies I've seen. A strong start to а whole festival dedicated to modern Chinese cinema - The Third Cinema or the cinema striving to implement social change.No special effects, no cities and groups of characters, nothing modern. Only the time at which develops the film. However, innovative techniques of shooting, incredible sense of human nature and outcome. It shows the basics of human existence - nature as home of humanity and the family as a social and cultural evolution. Ties that exist in life of everyone but are sensed on different levels. It is also specified the meaning of authentic human existence - in harmony with nature and respect for the past generations, because even the youngest imperceptibly become outgoing generation. It is their turn to take responsibility ""being alive"" for ourselves and for others.On places could be seem the presence of the Idea that holds this great nation throughout and makes its progress successful. Pierces principal links promoting its sustainability as a whole. It is possible to be build a gradation in the direction of the modern city as evidence after our line passing through small worker villages, larger villages and the city where the business is concentrated.For the bridges that we build continuously in the world around us. Very green and hitting the authentic humanism that is not based on anything but alone is a reason for everything. The relationship between father and son, and the difficult dialog between them. The place of the women and the mothers in the Eastern culture. An unpredictable journey, far different from the stereotypes of action and a happy ending.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"

It's similar area where the movie shot.The small villages around my hometown looks exactly like the ones in the movie.People lives there are exactly the same like people in the movie...The movie made me feel homesick. I miss the way the village people express their deep , strong yet suppressed of love. People are shy but people are so real!everything in this movie feels so real and beautifully presented.Highly recommended!"
那山那人那狗,Postmen in the Mountains (1999),,1999,2003.12.25,"Maybe in China every son can not balance the relationship with dad. At least it is this case for me. Father's love to son is very obscure in our country when the boy grows up(maybe after beyond 16 years old). They want to show their son they love them, but they can't find the correct way. In this movie, the father plays a role like this. He has to be away from home for almost all the time in order to deliver mails for people living in mountains. And the roads are very hard to walk on. He did the job very well because he made almost everybody appreciate his work. This is the biggest success of him, although he didn't get lots of money or high position.The reason I didn't rate it 10 is as follows: I don't think father should decide what his son should do in his future. But this film shows the contrary!During the process I saw this movie, I recalled a song named ""Dan Che"" by Eason Chan from Hong Kong. Both the movie and the song got my tears!

周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Regular readers of my comments know that nearly all my viewing is by recommendation. So, often I will pick a film that I know nothing at all about; this is one of those.My goal is to stumble upon a hidden gem that has escaped all the geniuses I know, that has such power that it takes me by surprise. Friends, if you are reading this and haven't yet seen the film, I have stolen the joy of discovery without knowing; but please do see this. It is precious.It is something between the best of Tarkovsky and what you might like of Kar-Wai Wong.The story is purely in service to the cinematic images, and those are in service to some very pure notions: Poetry as love, love as travel, travel as painting, painting as copying one's self and sending it out, going out as diving into water, diving as love, love as poetry.Unbelievably, each of these concepts is displayed in images of a train. You have to see it to believe it. Trains have been with film since the very beginning, and have been handled by masters. But I have never seen it so thoroughly explored, extended and exhausted as here.The narrative is folded and shifting. It could be a poem, a porcelain painting, a story from each of the four main characters that invents the others. It is quite confusing the first time around.The main thread is in the real world: a porcelain artist falls for a poet in another city. He writes poems for and about her, including her journeys on the train to see him. He gets sent to Tibet. She follows and on the way back is killed in an accident. Later, another woman (played by the same actress) meets the now famous poet and they fall in love. Or do they? This second woman travels on the same train.All of this is chopped and shifted around in presentation, and you have no idea who is telling or seeing what, including several episodes where the first girl also falls for a veterinarian she meets on the train. He may be an imaginary figure. Both the girl and the poet love two people but their bond, at least according to the poems, is much stronger.That's all the story you need to know to not be unsettled and to just go with the flow.What reminds me of Tarkovsky is the way the camera invokes parallel realities as if it glances into the mind as easily as outside a window. The camera is restless and goes to odd places, but once there temporarily becomes meditative. The simplest scenes become blossoms.If you ever loved someone distant, you'll recognize the magic of yearning driving a mythologizing of reality.You have probably seen the actress who plays the two women, Li Gong. She is as good as Liv Uhlmann in the way that Liv is capable of small, flitting expressions that each contain whole lives. She has some American films in production, I see.Please see this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"ZHOU YU'S TRAIN is the type of film that may require repeat viewing in order for the casual viewer to take in all the thia story has to offer: if you blink -- much like the effect of the quickly passing scenery out the window of any train -- you might miss a plot line, a character moment, or a perspective that would better be explored, as the climax to this evenly and perhaps-too-leisurely-paced romance shows. Zhou Yu (the lovely Gong Li) plays a young painter who falls in love with a shy poet, Chen Ching (played by Tony Leung Ka-Fai). Twice a week, Zhou Yu rides the train to be with him. On the train, however, a humorous veterinarian (played Sun Honglei) sees, approaches, and flirts with her. While she initially resists his desire, she eventually gives in to an indescribable curiosity which forces all of them to examine their various roles in one another's lives. While one could hardly argue with the notion that there are parts of TRAIN that appear uneven and, at least, forced, the film still manages to deliver a perspective worth a single view: who does Zhou Yu love and why? Torn between these two men for wildly conflicting reasons, she can't make sense of her dilemma. Instead of running from one of them, she inevitably chooses aspects of both for her affection, but this choice only forces her further and further into confusion.As a result, TRAIN explores more than one budding relationship, making the film as uneven as it is unpredictable. In fact, one could make the argument that what truly is transpiring here cannot be fully understood and appreciated until the film's final few moments .. but even then the viewer is left with many unanswered questions. Is that the message of the film, that life brings more questions than answers? Or is it merely a comment on how Zhou Yu chose to live her life? Or is it something even more?Regardless, what is clear is Zhou's desire to seek the answers to questions of the various loves in her life (two men, friendship, art, etc.), and the narrative clearly appears to be a device through which an exploration of the female mind and heart is undertaken. Whether you reach a destination is left entirely up to the viewer. Of course, the best scenery is Gong Li. She plays even utter confusion with beautiful conviction. If you're a fan of her work, then TRAIN is definitely for you."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Quite simply one of the best films ever made! Every element combines to produce a multi-layered masterpiece that revolves around the central tour-de-force that is Gong Li. This has to be her best film yet and she is wholly served by her fellow actors and production crew. Director Sun Zhou is a master of light with every scene's mood enhanced by his total control of the medium. One would like to have seen this film win multiple awards but the limited number of screens available to 'difficult' films like this make it nearly impossible to attain the recognition it deserves. Equally, Gong Li - the world's most beautiful and accomplished film actress - remains unknown to the unhappy teenagers who have only a diet of dross on which to feed their heads."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"I found this movie very beautiful and intriguing, mainly the cinematography, the soundtrack and the wonderful performance of cast with Gong Li, Tony Leung Kafai and Hanglei Sun. Unfortunately, the non-linear screenplay, associated to the difference with the Western cultures and language and the unusual names of the locations, made difficult for me to understand some parts of the story, and I had to rewind the DVD. The mysterious character of Xiu (Gong Li), the narrator, is not well explained and I believe she might have imagined the love story while reading the poem ""Zhou Yu's Train"" of Chen Qing, with Zhou Yu being her alter-ego. The last scene, disclosing the lake hidden by the fog, is fantastic. I am not sure whether the death of Zhou Yu in the bus accident is another metaphor. I intend to see this movie again in a near future, trying to understand it deeper and reevaluate my vote, which is presently six.Title (Brazil): ""O Trem de Zhou Yu""(""Zhou Yu's Train"")"

He captivated her and soon captured her heart with his poem personifying her natural beauty and comparing it to that a celestial lake.Soon they fell in love and began their twice weekly passionate affair while commuting to the city of Chongyang. But a fellow commuter named simply as Zhang Qiang, a veterinarian came in between the two lovebirds, with a secret amorous agenda of his own for Zhou Yu. But this is more than just a love triangle!A new woman named Xiu came into the scene. She looked exactly like Zhou Yu. But the scene took on a different era; a different time period. She was reading the book, ""Zhou Yu's Train"". Is Zhou Yu a real person? Is Zhou Yu really was Xiu? Or is Zhou Yu a figment of Xiu's romantic imagination?Be prepared for this surreal, non-linear movie experience."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Li Gong, better known as Gong Li in the West, stars in this taut, probing but occasionally confusing love story set in today's China.  Extraordinarily beautiful and also very accomplished as an actress, Gong Li is on a hiatus from historical spectacles and films with a threatening, for the government, political subtext.  I doubt any cultural satrap was put out by ""Zhou Yu's Train.""Zhou Yu paints bucolic and traditional scenes on cheap porcelain before they're finished and sent out to the world's Chinatowns or Chinese cities for sale to tourists.  She's talented but so are all the other women in her shop.  Great art this ain't.Zhou Yu regularly takes the train to another city where her not brimming with self-confidence poet boyfriend, Chen Qing, lives.  Chen is played by Tony Leung Kafai. On the train she meets veterinarian Zhang Quiang, Hanglei Sun.  He pursues her and a triangle develops, not an original one at that.Director Zhou Sun has Zhou Yu torn between a poet whose so far failed efforts at recognition she wishes to reinvigorate and advance and a country farm animal vet, a more lighthearted chap.  The train is a metaphor for separation and emotional journeying.  The train takes her between worlds, not just stations.A bit confusing, at least with subtitles, is Gong Li's second role as a narrator who appears at various points but who also has a direct relationship, apparently platonic, with Chen.  Perhaps it's clearer to those who understand Chinese.While Gong Li has several passionate love scenes, she orgasms without getting undressed, a tired sop to Chinese moral values which impact on directors' freedom. A shower scene shows nothing below her shoulders. Erotic?  Actually, very.The highpoint of the movie is Gong Li's total and believable immersion in a role that isn't very out of the ordinary.  But her acting makes the audience care about the resolution of her dilemma, one that I suspect many viewers will not like.Tony Leung Kafai and Hanglei Sun turn in fine performances in roles clearly subordinated to Zhou Yu's centrality in the tale.This story would amount to a ""B"" film if populated by Americans living in the rural Midwest.  But as a look at changing mores in China it justifies a7/10."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"In comparison to most other Chinese movies, the title of this movie has very significant symbolic meaning, symbolizing the point of no return.  It also has an poetic meaning, which neatly related to the plot of the movie which include a poet.  This is one of most obvious achievement of this movie, which also makes it a little different from the rest of Chinese movies.The social critic aspect of the movie is rather something ordinary, a theme that is common in most social critic films in contemporary China, and it is none other than the criticism of hedonism, materialism, and other common stuff you would find in Chinese movies about modern China."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Director Zhou Sun's movie from 2002 was somewhat of a rather long ordeal to get through. And I say that with the best of heart, because I was really trying to get submerged into this movie with heart and spirit, but it just never really spoke out to me or captivated me.""Zhou Yu's Train"" (aka ""Zhou Yu de huo che"") felt like a three hour long movie despite it just running at an average 1 hour and 37 minutes. It was the prolonged storytelling and constantly dragged out scenes where you watch Li Gong either walking in slow motion or sitting around lost in thought that made the movie seem like it was taking forever to get nowhere.And getting nowhere is exactly what director Zhou Sun managed to do with this movie. It is the story of Zhou Yu (played by Li Gong) a ceramic artist who travels a long distance twice a week by train in order to see her poet boyfriend Chen Qing (played by Tony Ka Fai Leung). During her numerous trips back and forth Zhou Yu befriends Zhang Qiang (played by Honglei Sun) a veterinarian who is enamored with the young artist.It should be said that the acting in the movie and the three main acting talents really did perform quite well throughout the course of the movie. They were just limited by the directorial hand of Zhou Sun.Storywise, then ""Zhou Yu's Train"" doesn't really come up with anything overly new or impressive, nor does it move the Asian cinema by any means. Sure, if you are a fan of Li Gong then there is some enjoyment to be had here, but as fan of the broader Asian cinema then ""Zhou Yu's Train"" came off as too slow paced and not overly much happening.""Zhou Yu's Train"" pulls a mere four of ten stars from me as the train is departing the station. I wasn't particularly impressed with the movie, and it took the director forever to virtually get nowhere. However, it should be said that the ending of the movie was quite good, although it wasn't much of a surprise twist."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"This motion picture defines the word ""artsy"". A film about a young and pretty porcelain painter who falls in love with a shy and melancholic poet (played by Sun Honleig), it aims to be a poetic work, but what you get is lots of ralenti shots to the point of saturation, piano and strings music, pretty landscapes enshrouded in fog, trains entering and exiting tunnels and Gong Li... In the past Miss Gong inspired true poetic films, as those directed by Zhang Yimou, but this movie is not one. Tony Leung plays another suitor, a sympathetic veterinarian with a welcome sense of humor, too materialistic to understand romantic love and literary inspiration, and wise to keep a distance, but not enough to balance this melodrama, with too much emphasis on sad love. I love trains, but this trip is on the boring side."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"This film tells the story of a woman who is in love with a poet far away, while a vet near her attempts to win her heart.""Zhou Yu's Train"" is not told in a linear manner, and hence it's super confusing. All the time, I thought there were only three main characters, the woman, the poet and the vet. The story jump back and forth, and it's hard to piece together the fragments to make a coherent story. This is not helped by the slow pace, numerous scenes of train and railway tracks, dragging the film longer than it needs to be. The most confusing thing is the ending, I didn't understand it at all, until I read the message board that says there is in fact a fourth character, also played by Gong Li! The film lost me and my interest completely, and there is no turning back. It would help to understand the story if I watched it again, but I'm not watching it again for sure."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Poetic, delicate, subtle. European film with Oriental irisations. Story about love and desire, about power of images and the honey of illusions. Cercles of symbols and chimeric gestures. Time like far lake and the past like only form of present. And a feminine Adonis between two different worlds.The character of Li Gong is a magnificent miniature not of a sensitive age or ambiguous feelings but for a way to define the existence. A way to explore each miracle as part of a sacred refuge, a river-trip. The train and the travels to loved friend, the poems and the house like essential sanctuary of a wonderful past, splendid for his ambiguity, the talks with realistic, sarcastic man for who the dreams are only offals of lost age and Zhou Yu- a pretty prey.For this film, the gestures or words are pieces of intense atmosphere. The search of truth is element of personal religion, the love- delicate shard of beautiful pot. The answers- breath of wind in a spring day. And the time- huge shadow of a way."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Beautiful film with the beautiful Gong Li about a pottery artist who takes the train twice a week to meet with mild mannered poet and the more brazen Vet she crosses path with on the train. If I could tell you more than that I would. This is a confused and confusing film that jumps through time and space with a bit too much abandon. The film is strangely compelling because its well acted and because it is so beautiful to watch. Sequences transpire that are absolutely stunning, but at the same time they play like oblique TV commercials. I like the film on some level even though I know I shouldn't. in all honesty its the sort of thing I'll probably pick up on DVD again since it can be had for around the cost of a rental, and I'd like to see it again to see if I'm daft and whether a wee hours viewing and having to switch vcds made a difference in my opinion."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"Li Gong is just about the best thing ever to come out of China. No matter how many films I have seen featuring her, I am always impressed.This is a difficult film to watch. You are never quite sure who you are watching. Li Gong is in a relationship with a poet (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and the practical vet (Honglei Sun). She travels by train between them.But, are we watching events in real time or narrated? It seems that what we are seeing is in the past. That the poet, Chen Qing, has a current relationship, and only has Zhou Yu in his heart.If this were an American film, then I believe it would probably be relegated to Lifetime, but with Li Gong, we have more than romance; we have poetry."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"The movie stays with you through the years. I saw the movie more than a decade ago and I still remember it. It seems slow-paced especially for young people, but it has lessons about life and relationships. The symbol of the lake used in this movie is very powerful (beautiful natural lake versus artificial lake). Love relationships could be exactly like the lake example."
周渔的火车,Zhou Yu's Train (2002),,2002,2004.07.16,"If you like the feeling of being mystified and of watching others being mystified themselves, then this is the movie for you. You have only to peruse the previous comments and notice the contradictions in them about plot elements and even dramatis personae to see how confusing this movie is. Most interesting of all, what someone understands to have happened in the movie seems not to matter. Almost all the comments are positive. (""Abject adulation"" might be a better phrase.) How much to blame Zhou Sun (writer, director) and how much to blame Cun Bei (novelist) must be left to readers of Chinese with time on their hands. All in all a travesty fit to be enjoyed by those who deserve nothing better!"
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Bai Xuemei (Huang Lu) has just graduated in college and can not find a job position. She meets a girl that introduces her to Manager Wu and she is hired to sell medicine herbs in a village in a remote mountain. Bai drinks a glass of water and when she awakes, she leans that she her documents have been stolen and she had been sold as a wife to Huang Degui, the son of a peasant family. Bai Xuemei tries to escape and she is raped and brutally beaten by Degui. She befriends Degui's cousin and local teacher Decheng that promises to help her to escape, but after having sex with her, Decheng is expelled from the village and leaves Bai Xuemei alone. She finds sympathy with two other women that have been also kidnapped a couple of years before and she starts giving classes to children. She unsuccessfully attempts to send letters to her family but the postman delivers all her letters to Degui. Bai Xuemei prostitutes with the local grocer and gets some money. When one of her student offers to send the letter to her, sooner her father appears in the village with two policemen to rescue Bai Xuemei. But the location is in a remote area and she is not secure yet.""Mang Shan"" is the story of a young Chinese woman that is lured, abducted and sold to be the wife of a man in an unbelievable society in the end of the Twentieth Century. It is well-known that in China, the families are allowed to have only one child per family and in many areas, female babies are drowned since the baby boy is more valuable to their primitive families. However, I am stunned with the ignorance of this corrupt society, where everyone everywhere needs to bribe to get the services, even medical assistance. Based on the IMDb credits, it seems that only the awesome Huang Lu is a professional actress and the cast is composed by mountain villagers, making the film even more realistic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Montanha Cega"" (""Blind Mountain"")"
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Blind Mountain is an excellent film about a college girl being duped into going into a mountain village and left there ""sold"" as a bride and her attempts to escape and get back to her family. The plot sounds trite but Yang Li's excellent direction and the crisp editing along with superb performances in the main roles, make this into a twisting horror story and the viewer knows not, where the plot is going.Apart from the main role of Bai and the teacher, all other actors were actual mountain village people which is startling in the uncompromising look at their culture and the hard lives ingrained into their faces, there are also some real, now rescued, ""brides"" playing themselves in the film. Although the film as a good social point to make, it's not preaching or forcing the issues on you but rather asking you to examine the situation. To the villagers, this is just life and it's always been this way, to observers they seem inhumane. Although the film obviously brings up the issue of the one child policy, these villages and bride trafficking have been going one since long before that policy was put into affect and still does in many parts of the world, not just China.Yang Li was in the audience and took questions at the Hawaii International Film Festival. It was annoying to see the Q&A get hijacked a little by feminists wanting to make a point and answering their own questions but other than that the director was frank and forthcoming about his film.Excellent. Recommended."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"This is an extremely compelling and thought provoking film.It portrays the fate of a young woman who accepts a job offer in the countryside and finds she has been sold as a bride to a family in a remote village in modern day China.It is extremely realistic, my uninformed guess is that there were very few professional actors involved. All the characters seemed completely true to life.Village life in modern China is very accurately portrayed. The Chinese government is vigorously trying to stop the old cultural practice of young women being sold as brides but traditions sometimes die hard; especially in areas remote from centers of authority.Most interestingly the film revealed how Chinese people relate to authority. The villagers' reactions to visits from party officials and the police were right on the mark.I watched this with a woman who grew up in in a small village and she confirmed its unerring accuracy.There are many wonderful improvements in the life of most Chinese people. This film doesn't negate them; but shines a light on one facet that is heartbreaking in its injustice.Make sure you catch this classic."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"The story is set in the nineties, but the situation has probably not changed much. The male/female ratio in China, especially in the countryside, is getting more and more unbalanced. Female foetuses are aborted, female babies are killed. Result: all those men, without a women to take for a wife and to have sons with. This paradox was clearly illustrated in the film, where a remote mountain village abducts women to marry its single men, while at the same time it is shown that a female newborn has been drowned. The women behind me in the theatre started commenting very indignantly about this: if they lack so many women, why kill female babies? The film makes a very strong statement: the woman is raped by the would-be husband with the assistance of his parents; the whole village, including the government officials, is collaborating to prevent the abducted women from escaping. I can imagine that the Chinese authorities are not very happy with the way its cadres are depicted, nor with the inability of the authorities to deal with the problem.While the film tells a harsh and cruel story in a very realistic way, it is also beautifully shot in a beautiful mountain area in Shanxi and it is well acted. I don't know if this film will be widely seen in China, but I hope it will be seen at least by the authorities who have the power to change these things. The very strong preference for male offspring is based on deep-rooted traditions: sons are responsible for funeral rites and ancestor worship, and sons have to take care of the parents in the absence of a social security system. The latter is now slowly being put in place in the cities, but is still not in place in the countryside. Also in the cities, more and more women are having well paid jobs and are thus able of taking care of their parents. Still, China is huge, and the catching up that the countryside will need to do will require a lot of time."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"I watched this movie at Hawaii International Film Festival and one of the best movies I have seen this year. The story is about a naive young girl who was abducted and ""sold"" to a mountaineer village as bride and her struggle to escape. The village is located deep in the mountains, remote and isolated and like many such villages in china in reality, has been this way for thousands of years. The script is based on real stories (I remember reading about reports on such stories in the early 90's in China), and the movie is extremely realistic in its depiction of the village, the characters and the logics of its dramatic development. Like another commentator said, the movie depicts the oppression of women in China, mainly the remote parts of rural China. However, it is far-fetched to quickly infer that the Chinese government is also complicit with the crime. Women have been sold into households as breeding tools and slaves for thousands of years in China. In urban areas, because of the Chinese revolution and Westernization in recent years, the status of women has been dramatically improved. However, in the remote rural areas, the feudal traditions and values still persist. The tragedy of the movie is, in the end of movie, despite the police efforts, nothing - not the strong-wills of the main character, not the institutional/legal system of the establishment - was able to triumph over the out-dated rotten tradition."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"I was able to see this movie at the Portland International Film Festival. I'm a huge fan of Asian cinema, particularly Japanese and Korean films. Before this, I had seen very little from the Chinese, and i must say this is a great introduction to China's promising film-making talent. Not one scene of this movie bored me, as i thought it certainly would. The majority of the movie follows the main characters imprisonment in the isolated village, and her numerous attempts to escape until the final, abrupt yet amazing, ending. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys great cinema, and i personally can't wait until i get my hands on this movie. Ironically, i saw this with my girlfriend on valentine's day. Talk about silly."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"BLIND MOUNTAIN (dir. Yang Li) Although set in China during the early 1990's, this drama seems completely out of sync with the modern world. A college educated young woman is lured to Northern China with the promise of a well paying job, but she actually has been sold to a village family to become the wife of their eldest son. The villagers would have let her go if she paid back the $7,000 in dowry money that they paid for her, but she has no identification or money, and they are convinced she is only trying to renege on the deal. The authorities were aware of her plight, yet took the side of the villagers. Apparently this is not an isolated incident, and the film implies that there are many such rural Chinese women in the same predicament. Although the subject matter is harrowing, the mountainous terrain where the film was shot is undeniably beautiful. Very much worth a look."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"In the early 90s, a young woman, Bai Xuemei, a recent college graduate, travels to the countryside of rural Shaanxi province believing she is going to start a job selling medicine to rural peasants. After arriving at remote village, she is drugged and awakes to discover her identity papers have been taken and she is the prisoner of her new 'husband', a contemptuous, uneducated peasant who has bought her for 7000 yuan. Bai protests and tries to leave but is forcibly restrained by her new 'family'. In fact, her new husband's parents assist him in restraining her so that she can be raped. Eventually Bai manages to escape her confinement and flees to inform the local police and is brought to the village chief. He, however, won't help her without proof (identity papers) or a refund of the 7000 yuan and returns her to custody of her would-be-husband. Later Bai meets other prisoner wives who share her fate but have long given up their will to escape. Horrified, as the seriousness of her predicament sinks in, she makes more desperate attempts to escape. Incredibly enough, the film is based on the real stories of women who were enslaved this way in rural China - the demand for wives brought about by the imbalance of male and female children in the countryside. For once an idyllic, isolated rural Chinese village is portrayed as a place of ignorance and malevolence and a place to escape from. Amazing acting from the cast of non-actors who play themselves very convincingly. The only disappointment might be Bai herself who, as a college graduate, doesn't seem to plan her escape attempts very well."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Bai Xuemei, recently graduated from college, is unwittingly sold, not by her family but by her friends, to a villager deep in the bowels of mountainous rural China ... in the 1990s! This is not a documentary. It's more a typical horror film pacing through the suffocating psychological terror of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre without any blood, only psychological and physical abuse, including rapefather and mother hold her down while her purchaser rapes her. Ouch!China is a vast expanse and this film's cinematography captures that space wonderfully. Bai Xuemei is so far up in the mountains it is simply too far to run to safety.Lu Huang who plays Bai Xuemei is the only professional actor in the film. The rest of the cast, from the shopkeeper to the Village Chief, are actual villagers. When the police arrive to make a rescue and the whole village gangs up on them demanding the girl repay the 7,000 they paid for her if she is to return home, it rings with a frightening authenticity. I watched this film feeling that with 5 minutes left to go she would be rescued despite everything suggesting otherwise.It's not that kind of film. Blind Mountain is an essay on the collision of traditional and contemporary culture. It's not pedantic, nor is it belittling to the realities of the culture at its source, but it's hard not to see it that way, especially through twentieth-century, western eyes. The film does a remarkable job of showing that it's not a matter of simply enforcing contemporary law. It's much deeper and difficult than that."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"And therefore miss some of the nuances, but its a watchable film if you like asian tragedy. its about trading women , whos numbers have decreased after the introduction of the one child per family politics.a boy is much more worth than a girl, and that makes young women, even high educated ones real easy targets to lure and then sell into the rural countryside. it happens all over the planet, but usually its rural girls being sold into the cities .the film has got some really primitive technical qualities, and the acting are quite stiff at times, but the mains do deliver a credible job to tell this story, though there are some holes in the timeline, and the end is very abrupt. it would have been interesting with a sequel or continuious film made ...... you know when this happens, but the timeline are narrowly told, and where they are would have helped a lot. china is a vast country with hundreds of ''tribes'' and the language,rites and traditions varies a lot. i may say that this is not a hollywood production, neither a norwegian or indiish. its made out of sheer will and poverty, and shall get acknowledgement from me.its recommended"
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"'Mang Shan', or as it is being distributed outside mainland China as 'Blind Mountain', is a tale of a barbaric practice that is still going on in China, as well as other parts of Asia:the kidnapping of young women & being sold as prospective brides,under the guise that they are being taken to a new job. This is the story of one young college educated woman who is taken to the far north of China,drugged, and abandoned to the mercy (or lack of)of a much older man. What follows is truly difficult to watch at times. Despite several attempts to escape, she is brought back to the farm where she tends to the pigs, as well as other chores. The local Mayor is no help,as is the postman, who gives her letters home back to her no good bastard of a husband. Word is that this film,although not outright banned by the Chinese government (big surprise in itself),was subject to some heavy cuts,as to render it viewable to the Chinese public (kind of like what happened to Ang Lee's 'Lust,Caution'). This is a difficult,but very well written, directed & acted out film of perseverance. Apparently,most of the cast are non professional,giving this grim film an even more realistic feel. Due to it's spotty distribution in the U.S.,finding a screening may be a hike, but is well worth it."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Unlike the strictly crass and oh-so-safe commercial film-making done here in the West, foreign filmmakers very often step up and put themselves on the line. It's to be envied. (Not emulated- not HERE- but certainly to be envied...) (Just for the record: with the exception of a couple of documentaries, there hasn't been anything done TO DATE about the disaster in New Orleans; no drama, nothing. How's THAT for feckless film-making...?) Having once tried to rescue a woman from a situation not unlike the one presented in BLIND MOUNTAIN, I can say without fear of contradiction that these situations exist even in THIS country and that the reasons are too many to enumerate. BLIND MOUNTAIN rings true, unfortunately. It's worth a nice long look."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"I noted that this film was set in the 1990's and that the main character had graduated from college. If so, how dense did she have to be to keep on giving letters to the postman and never get any replies? This point was made before but what got me was her reaction to her father during the rescue mission when she said it took him a long time to come and get her. This question indicated that she thought that only the last one she had given to the postman had been given to her ""husband"", which to me meant she was pretty but very dense. I did not buy into the stopping of the bus either and dragging her off. I have ridden buses in China and they don't stop just like that. I think there was an error in the photography in that I could see two dishes in the distance when there weren't any of those around in the early 1990's. Finally, the Chinese people in general obey the police, but here we have the police being harangued and even threatened by the villagers. Did it not occur to the leader that more police would show up should anything happen to the two who came with her father?"
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Through the undue course of ""Mang Shan"", Xumei(Lu Huang) makes so many wrong moves in her numerous endeavors to flee her agrarian confines, a western audience may start to wonder about the filmmaker's disposition towards women. College-educated and urban, nevertheless, Xumei allows herself to be outsmarted by these unschooled peasants with a naivety that strains the film's credibility as a feminist treatise, or an anti-communist manifesto. Masquerading as scouts for a pharmaceutical company, the young woman and her older male colleague who sells the cash-strapped college grad to the indigent farming family, inspires Decheng to ask Xumei, ""How could you have believed those guys?"" Since the seemingly kind schoolteacher turns out to be complicit towards the girl's forced detainment, this inquiry can be construed as a subtle mocking of his intellectual superior, whom he envies, having flunked his college entrance exams after graduation. This provincialism man; at one point, confesses to Xumei that he had never seen a train. In spite of her vaunted worldliness, in spite of her time spent on trains, however, this modern woman finds herself on equal terms with the rustic man; the very outcome that Mao Tse Tsung envisioned when he implemented his Great Leap Forward plan onto Chinese society during the Cultural Revolution. Over and over again, Xumei exhibits a counter-intuitive nature about her desperate predicament that's so alarmingly pronounced, questions about the filmmaker's attitudes towards women and higher-education need to be raised.For starters, the dawning that everybody within her adopted farming village is aligned against bought women from departing their regimented lives, crosses Xumei's mind with an extended deliberation that borders on mild mental retardation. After all, her own ""mother-in-law"" participated in the rape preliminaries for that first night she spent with Degui, the rapist, her ""husband""; a sure indicator that the social norms of civilization don't apply among these people. Befriending men, if not for the especial purpose of accruing money from sex, lacks the proper psychological motivation, which makes Xumei's friendship with Decheng somewhat unlikely. Given the context, the counterbalancing effects of romantic love plays out like a fallacy, because it suggests that the enslaved woman's bond with the farmer is merely an arranged marriage. Even worse, Xumei hands over letters to the postman without any consciousness of her husband's whereabouts when the exchanges are made. At the very least, she should look over her shoulder, since the correspondences to her father is a prelude for escape. Over time, despite having no indication that the letters had ever reached its destination, Xumei unceasingly acts without prudence by her continuing trust of the civil servant. Finally, a boy that Xumei tutors, sees what we already surmised, that the postman, like the village chief, like the other ""handmaids""(echoes of the Margaret Atwood novel abounds), like the schoolteacher, are all in on the conspiracy. It's beyond belief that a college-educated woman could be this dense, but the mortified look on Xumei's face, upon learning the fate of her letters, indicates that she believed her written transmissions were being sent. If escaping on foot proved to be difficult(Why doesn't she escape during the night? Why does she stay near the road?), a duplicitous postman should come to her as no surprise. Late in the film, Xumei becomes a schoolteacher herself; she oversees a group of young boys in her home. If ""Mang Shan"" truly sided with the concept of a free China, and free women, the film would have Xumei teaching these future men something a little more useful than mathematics."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"This was just not as good as Blind Shaft. It was too much of the same thing, but without interesting characters and good dialogue. The preliminary situation was very rushed, making it kind of silly, and I didn't really understand what was going on, except that the dialogue was seeming a bit cheesy.... The cinematography was very good and real, and the overall situation was disturbing and interesting, but it dragged on, and in the end it just did not pay off. There was no resolution like there was in Blind Shaft. Here it just sort of ended, without the situation really being solved in any way. It was frustrating. There were also a number of shots that just seemed pointless, like a shot of the main character looking off into the distance for about a minute, then a cutaway... Okay? I get that she's thinking about stuff but I don't really want to spend my time watching her contemplate. Shots like that and one of the old lady doing the loom over and over just got annoying. I think they were supposed to express a feeling of hopelessness or something along those lines but really it just got frustrating having the plot not advance at all. Basically there is no story here, it's just , ""Wouldn't it be terrible if you were kidnapped and sold to a small Chinese farm community that wouldn't let you go?"" Yes, yes it would. But that's really all there is to this movie. It's an ""isn't this a terrible situation to be in?"" kind of thing and it drags on and on with no resolution at the end. I feel a documentary on the subject of human trafficking would be more fitting to the subject."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"I heard about the movie from Leonard(a youtuber) when something happened in Harvest County(I don't dare to tell the name so I translated it), which shares the same event as the plots here.However the movie is banned in China because it has torn the fig leaf of the dark side."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"The style reminded me so much of Zhang Yimou's ""Not One Less"" - the way that it was directed with nonactors (only two of the characters were professional actors), the teaching of school children in the country side, and the contrast between the lifestyles of rural and urban China. In fact, I'm pretty sure that one of the locations in the city is a location in Not One Less  the broadcast station. I'm wondering whether or not the obvious influences are intentional, since this movie seemed to be receiving warm praise. I would hate to learn that the director did not realize the similarities between this and Not One Less, since Zhang Yimou's present influence seemed to be somewhat overt to me. The way in which it is shot mostly with wide lenses with a deemphasis on the shot in order to normalize and situate the film as a socialistic commentary on modern day China definitely owes much to the 5th gen directors Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, and others (at least in my opinion). I don't think this film is anywhere near the level that those experienced veterans are used to making, but it's a good effort. I think the biggest thing that it lacks is fluency between scenes and I think that that is a burden the actors have to carry. It's difficult to direct nonactors (imagine being abducted to act for a month, i'm surprised they weren't terrified 100% of the time). He actually used real policemen, hospital workers, and rural villagers and although they don't have to pretend to be anyone other than themselves, it can be dangerous if these characters have a presence in the movie because they have to be able to carry on the story in their own way as well. Even minor roles have motivations and emotional arcs, but it seems as if these people have lost them, and are acting from a shot to shot basis without any idea of how the overall story is like. I'm glad I got to see this film though, despite the acting, because it gives me a chance to see how important the element of directing your actors are. And I definitely respect the choice of using nonactors. It seems to be a characteristic feature of many of these kinds of international films. Besides, these people have a realistic understanding of the micro-cosmic world of which we so easily play critic from afar. You just have to know how to tap into it."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"I was rather unwillingly dragged to see this at a screening last night by an acquaintance. From what I'd read the film really didn't appeal but since I could see no way of getting out of it, I settled down to make the best of a bad draw and/or see what i could snaffle in the way of freebies.I'm very glad I stayed, the film was excellent. It tells the story of an educated urban young woman who accepts a job to help pay for her studies by selling medical supplies in the hinterland. The usual plot Mugffin happens and the rest of the film details her relationships with her captors, the villagers and her attempts to escape. A pedestrian plot outline you may say, but it was acted with verve, in particular, Huang Lu as the protagonist was utterly convincing and all in all a well spent hour or two.Few freebies, alas but I had an excellent meal afterward which made up for most of that."
盲山,Blind Mountain (2007),,2007,2008.03.12,"Blind Mountain""Blind Mountain"" is a Chinese film with realistic characteristics. It is acted by Lu He, and directed by Yang Li. The film tells a story in the form of documentary. In the film, a young university student is abducted by human trafficker and sold to a rural countryside with little legal knowledge as wife. She is trapped in the countryside for years until rescued by police. The film is based on the true story. Unlike other commercial films, ""Blind Mountain"" adopted unconventional measures. Firstly, actors of this film are not professional actors buy ordinary from public. The director of this film is trying to illustrate an atmosphere in a more natural form, which makes the scenes more real and close to life. Thanks to actions of unprofessional actors, scenes of the film are presented more vividly. Actors are able to interpret their roles by their own understanding. One of actors has real-life experience of being abducted and trafficked. Such experience is lacked in other films. The scenes presented in this film are set to the background of Chinese countryside. In Chinese countryside, life in poverty tends to promote peasants to break laws for their own good. Because of the tradition with the typical rural Chinese families, family tradition is regarded to overpower laws. The director films this story in the real rural Chinese village in order to construct the atmosphere of such tradition. The film tends a dark art style; warm color tone is not found anywhere in the film. Such art style makes the audiences feel miserable life experience of main character, and gives a visual impact of depression. The effect is achieved especially when the girl is trafficked to the rural village while nobody helps her. She later understands that she is isolated because the whole village shield each other for human trafficking. Audiences can feel overwhelmingly suffocated, because the hope will almost never been expected in the film. The dark style color tone of the film strengthens such feeling. Such technique convinces the audiences that they are watch a dark story. Even in a sunny day, the director treats the scenes as it is overcast. The film does not come with background music as supplement, although it is able to heighten the atmosphere with plots and scenes. This is another unique characteristic this film carries. Audiences are only able to hear the true noise from the background, and the scripts are the actual focus. The film does not try to achieve resonance of audience by music. The only channel of knowing the plot of the film is conversations among actors. Since there is no background music, the simple conversations rather bring audiences impact and sense of reality. In China, we will hear new about abduction of women and infants from everyday newspapers and TV news. However, we have no way to understand what abducted women and babies have experienced. This film tells an ugly truth that even exists in today's China society. In the film, the word 'blind' in ""Blind Mountain"" includes a lot of meanings. The literal meaning of 'blind' is unable to see. However, in the film it represents the life of isolation, illiteracy, and under-civilizations in Chinese rural countryside. 'Blind' also represents the desperation and hopelessness inside the main character's heart. There is no hope, there is no help. Nobody will ever communicate with her, and she is trapped in an isolated mountainous village. The film tries to unveil village residents' lack of heart and humanity. The end of the film also brings great impact to audiences that the main character has to give up her own daughter to escape from the village. The film finally gives an impression of abducted women's miserable life that even escaped from the village; they have to suffer from the separation from who they love. (Because of the Chinese censorship, the film comes with two different endings. This essay only elaborates the ending of the version that is publicly shown in China.) ""Blind Mountain"" is not a commercial film. However, it brings even more impacts comparing with other commercial films. The reason is that the director chooses a story that is difficulty to believe, and uses a more realistic way to tell the audiences an inconvenient truth. ""Blind Mountain"" vividly illustrates image of the bottom side of Chinese society. Overall, it is a successful film."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"What happens to a collectivist, traditional society after it is traumatized by two extreme social experiments within a period of half a century  dehumanizing communism and equally alienating rampant materialism? Perhaps the best film to come out of mainland China in a decade, Yu Li's Ping Guo is both a scathing social commentary on the state of present day China and a moving human drama. The film, as well as its characters, looks like Beijing: Grey, polluted, crowded and confused. Acting is uniformly excellent. Bingbing Fan, the stunning young actress with morning-after eyes, is superb in the title role as the all-too-human Ping Guo. As the story unfolds and the humanity of the other three leads begin to rise above their greed and apathy, Ping finds her inner strength. The ending, which should be predictable, comes as a touching surprise.Others have commented enough on the story. It is best to walk into this film without knowing too much about it. If you are a frequent visitor to China or an observer of its mind-blowing ascent, the film will have more to say to you. However, both the story and the characters are universal. Even a passing knowledge of that fascinating society is sufficient to enjoy this minor masterpiece, although you might miss its many subtle ironies.Chinese authorities banned the film from being shown in China. They also banned its producers from working in the industry for two years. The decision, which is almost an unofficial award, won't stop those who want to watch it."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"The story itself seems unlikely, starting when An Kun, a city migrant working as window cleaner, by chance witnesses Liu Pingguo, his wife, being raped by her boss, Lin Dong, the sleazy owner of a massage parlor. Seeing an opportunity, An Kun goes to Lin Dong for hush money. When he refuses, An Kun reveals everything to Lin Dong's wife, Wang Mei. Wang Mei is upset but not surprised at her husband's actions and tells An Kun he will never get the money. However, as a form of compensation, she offers to have sex with An Kun and they start an affair. These two couples are brought closer together when Pingguo becomes pregnant and there is uncertainty about who the father is. Since Lin Dong desperately wants a son, he now willingly offers compensation. An Kun accepts the money but becomes increasingly uncertain of his decision to give up the child.As farcical as this plot may seem, everything is handled in a realistic way. Even the story in some way represents the common dilemmas faced by immigrants to the big city. Personalities are nuanced. Characters are neither wholly abusive and evil nor passive and innocent. Every detail in the environment is authentic, modern China. The acting, and cinematography are brilliant. Beijing is remorseless, cold and bleak. The city provides opportunity and wealth but not without cost. Broadly speaking, this film is a social commentary about greed and desire and elusive satisfaction of modern life."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"Being an international student studying in U.S. I would probably have a very different point of view of this movie, that being said, I hope that I can give some insight of this movie with my past life of living 24 years in Beijing and additional 3 years of life living in U.S. First, let me make one thing clear, if anyone thinks this is a cheap movie with stupid plot such as a girl being raped and she actually enjoyed the process, please go back to watch the movie again, or just switch to some Hollywood movie which will give you a fantasy that ends up with happy after forever. This is a movie about the real life of people in Beijing, it is well founded, carefully thought about, and shot in a very skillful camera angles. Now I am going to give evidence and explanations why I think so.The background scene: if you watched it closely, you probably have found that most of the scenes are so gray, suppressing, with typical cold colors, the movie is also shot in winter. That is the realistic view of winter Beijing, having the cold wind cutting into your bones. It is not an easy weather to live in, as someone raised in this kind of weather, you learn to endure it, suffer from it, and adapt to it. This kind of weather of course makes the life even harder for poor immigrant workers. This detail is just so true and so carefully expressed over the whole film. This rendering effect sets the baseline of the whole film, which is a sad, unfortunate, but realistic movie. Characters and culture. I think one of the main things that the director/script writer wants to express here is, the mispositioned female status in the Chinese culture. I saw no one here actually commenting on this. This idea is hidden deep, but it is pretty obvious if you understands the life of Chinese people and have been in touch with some western culture. An kung and Lin Dong, one poor one rich, both regard the women as some kind of possessions in their lives. An kung asked for money when he found out that his wife has been raped. If you are a traditional Chinese, you may even find this reasonable, but if you look at this from a different view, he is regarding his wife as his belongings, he's asking for money as a compensation because, his belonging is damaged, and he believes that money can compensate all his sufferings (well, if you regard women as a commercial product, you can buy a different one with more money, right?). Lin Dong, regards his wife and ping guo as the tool for having offspring. This is revealed so nicely if you think about all the details, he wants a boy not a girl, prayed to God for it(probably to carry on his business since he's rich.) His own wife can not give birth, so he goes out all the time to hookers and he acts as if he has the right to do so. When ping guo was pregnant he just directly came to his wife and acted like: look, you can't do it, so it is reasonable for me to find someone else to do it. Ping guo and Wang mei, being the women in such a culture, regarded their inferior position as natural, accepted them and almost never disobeyed or tried to fight. Some details: Wang Mei said she could never object her husband's decision for 16 years. (But being a well educated rich woman, she eventually revenged by having sex with An kun. It is funny and interesting if you paid attention to what she said during the sex.) Ping guo, as a weak, uneducated woman, having no power in the society, no freedom, being so desperate to have someone to rely on and someone to love her, became the center of the whole tragedy. Raped, deserted by her husband, and raped by her husband, then slapped by the woman richer. She actually found a little love from Lin Dong, although she knows that it is purely on the sex basis, but even that is better than having nothing. And she even tried to accept such a disgusting relationship. The ending seems random, but actually giving all the information you need to understand what the movie wants to reveal, two women sitting together, both realizing that they are the victims of the culture, holding hands in tears. While both men, deserted by their women, pushing cars together on the high way.(Implying that the materialistic things, namely cars and money that they pursued after will eventually fail them. They are so stupid to lose love over trivial things as money, or power.) Xiao Mei is the character not so important, but also a crucial part of the whole story, being a hooker, she's a live description of how woman are forced by life itself to drop into the traps of death. It also gives a powerful impression on how limited the options are from which the poor Chinese people have to choose from, and how hard life is there. There are a lot more details, but I don't have space and time to explore them, it is a movie worth of watching, I have already gone through it for the 3rd time, and still find new things. I hope everyone reading this can understand a little more about the Chinese society and culture."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"This is the first movie I've seen come out of Mainland China of respectable quality. I'll admit I haven't seen many, but from what I have seen, this is certainly above and beyond.The story is about a poor migrant couple and a wealthy couple living in Beijing. Their lives become intertwined through a set of unfortunate and somewhat disturbing circumstances.I'm not perfectly fluent in Mandarin, but the acting was good from all four main characters. The less experienced Bingbing Fang was especially good as Ping Guo, the lead character. The scenery is set amid the toxic haze of a sprawling Beijing with lots of greys and muted colours.The best thing about the movie for me was the amazing contrast between the lives of the rich and the poor. Even though I'm surrounded by it daily, this movie gives a little bit more intimacy than what I'm normally exposed to. Other common themes were greed and face.Ultimately, the production values of the movie were very good, from the cinematography to the acting, but the conclusion doesn't really leave you with a good taste in your mouth. I think this is good though, because it sticks closer to what reality might be like, instead of having clearly defined heroes and antagonists with a full circle ending."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"This is a story about Liu, who works in a massage parlor (mostly just foot massages) for boss Lin Dong. After getting drunk with a friend from work who was fired, she gets raped by Lin Dong. It turns out, Lin's husband An Kun, a window cleaner just happening to be cleaning the windows at the time and witnessing this, tries to extort money from the boss. Liu becomes pregnant and there is a question of the unborn baby's paternity. Since the boss's wife Wang Mei is unable to bear children, Lin Dong wants badly to be a father, and makes a deal with the girl and her husband, that if its his baby, he'll keep it and give the couple $100,000 yuan. The film is at first farcical due to its unusual premise. It then becomes a strange morality play, that telling lies turns to pain. Beijing is pictured in every outdoor frame of the film as bustling, with constant high rise construction going on. However, I don't see specifically what relevance it has to the story, except to highlight haves and have nots (and want a lot mores). No joke here, it could have been ""lost"" in any decent sized city in the world. The real problem here is that there are no characters to like, except, to an extent, the wife of the boss, Wang Mei. This film, by the end, filled me with more indifference than pity or hope. I get it, money probably is everything. Everyone in this film made their bed and is now lying in it (the pun is completely intentional). If you have seen the actors in other films and like them, by all means go see this film. However, if you're not a giant fan of films made in mainland China, I'd skip it."

This is a very good thing - in my opinion movies are supposed to make you think, supposed to move you. Ping Guo did just that and is worthy of watching for everyone who isn't afraid of foreign movies and who is willing to look at something else than popcorn Hollywood.This movie will keep you entertained for nearly two hours and will make you want for more movies of this director.

Given that it has been banned in China, I perhaps foolishly succumbed to the current US government's anti-China propaganda, and expected there to be political reasons for the ban, but that is quite obviously not the case.If anything, the ban was more from the fear that people ""down on the farm"" would come to think that living in a major Chinese city carries with it the same fears and worries as living in a major US city -- which, let's be absolutely honest, is nowhere near the truth.It's beautifully written and beautifully realised. Far and away better than any Western movie I've had to sit through, lately -- the words ""sex"" and ""city"" come to mind. In some ways, it's the same basic idea as that movie , but there's just no comparison.The only possible bug-bear for Western viewers is that Chinese emotions may be ""inscrutable"" to them, because they're not used to the East/West differences in facial characteristics. I'm British, with a Royal Navy background, so I can perhaps see such things more easily than someone from ""down on the farm"" in the US -- but it can't be that hard to see what the characters are feeling, when the actors are playing the parts so well.Be ready to laugh, to ""maintain a stiff upper lip"", to hate people for what they do, and to love those same people for other things they do.It's a blinder, this one. Watch it.Addendum: Could the IMDb spellchecker be made to take note that the Websters is not a real dictionary?"

苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"China's weird. Didn't we just learn from the Olympic Committee that there's billions of people living there? I think we did. Why then is this one of only a few films I can think of, off the top of my head, coming from there that has any semblance of lived-life-now? Lived life now under peculiar circumstances, sure, because it is a movie after all, but still. Everything else seems to be costumed drama kung fu palace historical Mao-sanctioned fantasy crap. I'm talking mainland China here. Taiwan and Hong Kong don't count. Ang Lee doesn't count. All the Chinese filmmakers making films in other parts of the world, and getting them financed and released in other parts of the world, don't countand there's the rub.Lost in Beijing is banned in China and its filmmakers are banned for two years from making films in China. What kind of nonsensical time-out is that? I mean no disrespect to the Chinese, I just want more of them to fall through the cracks and make films like Lost in Beijingwhich is nothing like Farewell My Hero's Kingdom of Flying Yellow Flowers.Fan Bingbing, known in the west as Bingbing Fan, stars in this film as Liu Ping Guo (Ping Guo, the Chinese title, translates literally as ""Apple""), a foot massage girl who is raped by her boss (played out-of-this-worldly great by Tony Leung Ka Fai who's been in enough movies that every Chinese citizen could pick a film of his to see without any two people seeing the same filmwestern audiences may know him as the guy who has sex with Marguerite Duras in The Lover), and the rape is witnessed by her husband, a window washer who just happens to be hanging from a scaffolding washing the windows of the room at the massage parlor where the rape takes place. Foot massage is big business in China so I guess that's why this massage parlor is some kind of skyscraper that needs these scaffolded window washers, but I digress. The husband sees this as an opportunity to milk a little money from the well to do parlor owner. Lost in Beijing turns a critical eye toward the new moneyed urban class set against the rural, immigrant-in-their-own-country, if you will, working class.Bingbing's husband confronts Tony's wife with the rape news and demands money for his pain and suffering, yes, you read that right, his pain and suffering. Tony's wife laughs at him and suggests a better revenge would be for him to have sex with her, and then in a moment of barely noticed brilliance while she's riding him cowgirl puts sunglasses on him so she can't see him looking at her.It turns out Bingbing is pregnant and things get a little more complicated. If you complain when a film uses overly convenient plot devices to move forward you probably won't like this film as much as I do. I'm more concerned with the caliber of the characters. All four of the main performances in Lost in Beijing are magnificent. (Tony's relationship with, and handling of, his over sized wallet/day-planner is hilarious, as is his response of randomly checking the top of his head for bald spots when he's busted for trying to use a mirror to peek at Bingbing in the shower.) The direction is good and the camera-work creative, sometimes a little too creative to the point where I got dizzy a couple times so I'm deducting a point for that. Beijing is the backdrop here, captured in all its beautiful gray and desolate self."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"I normally wouldn't waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this. However, I'm off of work this week, so I have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities. To start, let me say that I frequently enjoy non-commercial, non-mainstream, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) That said, there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the U.S. Trust me, I've been tortured by hundreds of them. ""Lost In Beijing"" is one particularly bad film.The opening half hour is an impressive, non-stop exhibition of moral degeneracy. This film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as Kim Ki-duk's ""Bad Guy"" (2001). 1. women actually enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised, and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you like, because while your ""doing"" her she'll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm; 4. if you're wife gets raped, make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money, but if he doesn't pay, just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation; 5. if you're wife gets raped, be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist, taunting her with lines like, ""Did he fu*k you like this?""; 6. if you're husband is a rapist, just accept it; 7. after you personally get raped, befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible.How can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters? They're nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other. Don't misunderstand me though. I'm very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own. ""Ichi the Killer"" (2001) and ""Moonlight Whispers"" (1999) are very interesting portrayals of sado-masochism. ""Strange Circus"" (2005) is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse. ""Marriage Is A Crazy Thing"" (2002) is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage. Even religiously-based movies like ""Running On Karma"" (2003) and ""Samsara"" (2001) have entertained me on occasion. The difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them, whereas ""Lost In Beijing"" has virtually none.It's known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet, but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior. Why, exactly, does Bing Bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist? Why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally? The filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy. It all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides. Other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason you can't choose which person to root for is because they weren't developed properly. Don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they're not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they're not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they're thinking. This is hardly a positive attribute of this movie. On the positive side, the camera-work and acting are quite good, but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses. You can place this alongside trash like ""Turning Gate"" (2002), ""What Time Is It There"" (2001), ""Irreversible"" (2002), and the aforementioned ""Bad Guy."""

I would like to think that one of these stages, one that comes somewhere towards the end of industrialisation, relates to the need to make rather miserable social realist films with wobbly camera work, jump cuts, shallow focus, piano scores in minor keys, and long takes of (non-professional) actors ""acting"", which win Golden Somethings at European film festivals. China, it appears, is no exception.OK, I'll admit to being cynical. It is clearly a well-funded, well-produced, and well-observed drama. And I suppose that social realist films don't generally have happy endings, so I shouldn't be smug about that either. Yet, if I had to distil my criticism down to one thing it would be the director's wilful conformity to the ""genre"". I find myself yearning for Zhang Yimou's films of the late eighties and early nineties, when Chinese film had a real sense of identity. Now it seems to be a mish-mash of various Western influences and little substance, a bit like Mando-pop (just with less smiling). This ""conformity"" takes on an ironic edge, not just because it was made under a communist government, but because the government banned it. In addition, the producers have been banned from making another film in China for two years, which strikes me as being just enough time to promote this film in Europe, write another one and get some European funding for it! OK, OK, still being cynical. It is a good film. The script is engaging and occasionally quite surprising (especially as we all know it's going to end in tears). The acting is good all round, especially thanks to two Asian cinema stalwarts Tony Leung Ka Fai and Elaine Jin (think Robert De Niro and... um... Juliette Binoche?) playing the boss and his wife, Wang Mei. Elaine Jin steals the show really, creating a character who is both impetuous and enigmatic at the same time. There are some nice insights into Beijing life, which are welcome post-Olympics razzmatazz. The direction is a bit contrived as I have noted, but when director Yu Li finally shakes off film school and gets the camera on a tripod it makes for a nice last few scenes.That said, the film struggles to find its focus. While it's clearly a film about Fan Bingbing's physically and emotionally abused heroine, the POV shifts to that of her husband for large swathes of the narrative and we are left feeling rather sympathetic for him despite his (rather unsubtle) faults. The second act lightens in tone so much that it seems to be heading towards black comedy. The one and only sub-plot involves a prostitute who seems to be there to remind us that the four central characters are not the only ones having a crappy time – and she drops out of the story just as conveniently.And then there's the controversy. Yes, it's got sex in it and no, Beijing wasn't happy with that. Would the film be any different without the sex scenes? Not really - decide for yourself. Two swallows don't make a summer, just as two arses don't make a controversial film necessarily polemical. Mind you, 2007 was quite a year for Hong Kong film royalty showing their posteriors - the other Tony Leung (Chiu Wai) bared his for 'Lust, Caution'... But I digress.If you have watched a lot of these films from emerging economies, you will recognise the format all too well and, given the necessarily downbeat subject matter, the only pleasure might be guessing exactly how everyone is going to plunge into the misery for which they were all destined. Oh well. As films of this genre go it's not bad, so give it a go and make your own mind up."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"Unleashed on the unsuspecting English speaking world under the title ""Lost in Beijing"", this is a truly abysmal film. I really hated it. No, I didn't just hate. I utterly despised it. This is the first film that I have seen in Mandarin and the first entirely in a non-European language so that was interesting, which is certainly a great deal more than can be said for the film itself. The film's co-writer and director Li Yu is one of the few women to perform either function in the Chinese film industry. That's quite impressive. However, I would have been significantly more impressed with that accomplishment if she had any talent. I'm a big believer in assigning blame where blame is due so I should say that Fang Li was the other person responsible - and I use that word deliberately - for this blight on cinema. The ""script"" is absolutely appalling and not one moment of it comes close to resembling reality.The numerous sex scenes and its pronounced anti-government tone ran afoul of the Chinese censors which led to the film being banned in its native country, albeit after it had already been released in a heavily edited fashion. I'm very much against banning films or any other work in principle but I could have lived with having never seen this film. I found parts of it very offensive, not the aforementioned sex scenes but the often incredibly tasteless treatment of the subject matter. Other parts of it seemed like they had been written by a 15-year-old boy who had seen one too many pornos. If cinema were food, this film would be food poisoning. I assume that the Mandarin dialogue was translated accurately, even if it wasn't transcribed accurately since the person who wrote the English subtitles had clearly never heard of a full stop. The dialogue was pathetic but I would not be surprised if it gained something in translation. I would certainly not be averse to watching another film in Mandarin. This film showed me that making absolutely dreadful films is not the soul purview of the English speaking world. That's something, I suppose.The film stars Fan Bingbing in a mediocre but...well, no mediocre performance as Liu Pingguo, a young woman from a poor province who has migrated to Beijing with her idiot husband An Kun, played badly by Tong Dawei. She works as a foot masseuse at the massage parlour Golden Basin. One night after a party, she is raped by her boss Lin Dong, played in a rather good performance by Tony Leung Ka-fai. By an astonishing coincidence, at that exact moment, An Kun just so happens to be washing that exact window and witnesses the rape. That night, he has sex with Pingguo while saying, ""Did he ¤¤¤¤ you like this?"" Irrespective of how it was intended, it came across as marital rape. An Kun then decides to blackmail Lin Dong for 20,000 yuan. He later visits the rapist's wife Wang Lei, played by Elaine Jin in the film's best performance, and she suggests that they have sex to even the score. She takes the fact that her husband is a rapist in her stride, expressing no shock or sympathy for his victim. The plot, such as it is, is a powerful repellent against logic, common sense and common decency.This unconvincing and sordid melodrama gets even more complicated when Pingguo learns that she is pregnant and that either Lin Dong or An Kun could be the father. Given that Wang Lei is infertile, the two couples come to an arrangement: Lin Dong will give Pingguo and An Kun 100,000 yuan if the baby is his whereas they will receive nothing if the baby is An Kun's. This part of the film devolves into what I assume was intended to be funny. This part of the film was basically a black comedy involving a rapist, his victim and their respective spouses who are having an affair to make up for the rape. Classy. As it turns out, An Kun is the father but he bribes the doctor into falsifying the blood test results so that Lin Dong thinks that the child is his. Pingguo and An Kun move in with Lin Dong and An Kun with Pingguo pretending to be her son's nanny. In an entirely unbelievable development, Pingguo becomes quite fond of Lin Dong. Eventually, he discovers that he is not the child's father and he breaks down crying while sad music plays in the background. Boo bloody hoo. It boggles the mind that this scene, the worst of a very bad bunch, was included. I was infuriated, disgusted and offended that I or anyone else was expected to feel sympathy for a rapist because the woman that he raped had a child that wasn't his. It's contemptible. Even thinking about the scene makes my skin crawl.Overall, I was not a fan of this film. If this does not turn out to be my least favourite film of 2016, I may give up on films altogether. Actually, I may give up on humanity altogether, move into the mountains and spend the rest of my hopefully very long life communing with nature. I only finished watching it because I made myself a promise that I would finish each and every film no matter what and there was certainly a lot of ""what"" on this occasion. Or maybe it was because I practiced self- flagellation in a previous life. As I was loaned a copy of the film on DVD, I didn't have to pay a cent for it but I still feel like asking for my money back. I would rather have dysentery than watch this again."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"What kind of new era is this? Dickens wrote in the opening of A Tale of Two Cities that ""this is the best of times, this is the worst of times; this is the age of wisdom, this is the age of folly; this is the season of light, this is the season of darkness; this is the spring of hope."". It's the winter of disappointment; people have everything in front of them, people have nothing in front of them; people are on their way to heaven, people are going to the gates of hell. "" This may be the best answer."
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"This movie came as a bit of a shock to someone who had lived in China as an exchange student in the 1980s, when only the most stifling, gov't approved propaganda films were allowed. I knew China had changed since I had been there, but this was an eye-opener. Some of the sex/rape scenes were more explicit than in many Western films. The plot seemed to go from very serious to semi-absurd, as the rapist negotiates a detailed contract with the couple whose wife he raped--and, they agree to it.Anyway, overall, I think the film was well-made and shows how complex life in modern China can become--but, brace yourself for lots of sex. I can certainly understand why communist authorities in China banned the film. If I was a commie, I'd ban it too! ;-)"
苹果,Lost in Beijing (2007),,2007,2008.01.25,"I see this movie as a commentary on the new morality in Beijing brought on by modernization. This modernization could not have happened unless there was a mobile work force so the government made a conscious effort to diminish the familial bonds. How else could a worker travel thousands of miles to Beijing or Shenzen to find work? Money had to become of greater importance. The other modernization was that men could only legally marry one woman. In previous times, men would take another wife. In previous times, families would buy children.With these two changes to Chinese society, this movie could ensue. An Kun and Liu can now be in Beijing. Lin Dong and Wang Mei would be childless. The lust, heartbreak, the anguish, the loathing, all results. The viewer is left with the question whether the new morality is better than the old. I think the writers preferred the old."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Who would have thought that Zhang Yimou, once art house darling and for trying too hard at the martial arts genre, could be capable of pulling off an all-out, slapstick black comedy with A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop? It certainly took my by surprise, and showed that he's more than willing and capable of stepping outside his comfort zone, to remake what's essentially The Coen Brother's Blood Simple, albeit set in a period Chinese era and in context as well, with the bar in an unnamed Texas town becoming a noodle shop out in a desert.And paying homage to The Coens isn't just the only one here. Curiously, the finale sequence was very similar to how Danny Boyle decided to end Slumdog Millionaire, with an out of place song and dance sequence that became more absurd as the clip ticked by. Serving little purpose other than to get everyone lip sync, dance, spin some dough, break the 4th fall and essentially telling us that everyone had a swell time making the film, I thought this could be done without since the end was quite pitch perfect.Beginning with an introduction to the important plot element of introducing a gun into the story, a group of Persian merchants come into Wang's (Ni Dahong) noodle shop to sell some wares, and ultimately Wang's Wife (Yan Ni) decides to buy a three-barrelled gun. Nobody knows what for, and a cannon demonstration brings forth the local police, whose chief investigator Zhang (Sun Honglei) gets engaged in an expensive scheme by Wang to finish off his adulterous wife and her lover, employee Li (Xiao Shen-Yang). But of course things never go according to plan, especially when everyone has their own agenda, and it becomes one heck of a comedic blood bath with motivations questioned, and you the audience left wondering just how everyone will get out of this mess.Zhang Yimou once again goes for very saturated colour schemes for his films, from the rich blues of the skies to the orange-brown sands of the desert land, and this time too keeping his characters in single-toned striking colours. If anyone doubts the director in being able to helm a comedy, the opening scene itself will allay those fears, and indeed much of the physical comedy come thanks to the wonderful casting, especially that of the two bumbling shop assistants caught up in the complicated events only because they're looking toward settling their back pay.It highlights how men become easily tempted by money, the root of all evil, when faced with bucket-loads of them, and how coincidences play a huge part in getting the characters where they end up, with each unfortunate moment ending in becoming a corpse (yes, there will be blood, and death) in a seemingly convoluted narrative that has to be seen to be believed the kind of rich writing which can pull it off. But what I enjoyed more, is how modern day devices are given the old fashioned treatment, such as the police ""siren"" - horse mounted and wind-generated - and a combination lock, designed with an abacus, no less!A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop may seem like a less than epic film from Zhang Yimou, but it sure is a lot of fun delivered by its outstanding casting who seem all too comfortable in dishing out black and physical humour. Recommended, just so you know that the director has the bandwidth to do a lot more than what his filmography thus far has pigeon-holed him into."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Zhang's latest is a remake of the Coen Brothers' debut film, Blood Simple. It's a slightly more comic adaptation, set in the distant past in the beautiful Gobi (?) desert. It opens wonderfully with the beautiful colors and impeccable cinematography that have always been a trademark of Zhang Yimou. Unfortunately, when it gets into the Blood Simple plot, it becomes very mechanical. I'd say that it lacks suspense because I know the story, but I've seen Blood Simple half a dozen times and it holds up every time. Every time, the tautness of the plot works. There's just something a little bland about this adaptation. I'd still moderately recommend it for the visuals, and the vibrant opening sequence, where the titular woman (Ni Yan, who is pretty good though she can be annoying at times, too) buys the titular gun from a wacky Persian salesman."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"I watched this in Berlin at the Festival there and unfortunately I was sitting near an older couple who were commenting on the movie. You read this right, they were old and commenting on what happened on screen in a despicable way. Their view of the film is also the view some others have (see the rating for that), still it was a bit annoying hearing them while watching.One of the most common point that gets criticized, is that this is not worthy for a man like Yimou. I don't think it is fair to write something like that, but it's always how a viewer will watch this movie. With what expectation one goes into a movie. If you let yourself see through the comedic set pieces and the absurdity of most of them (you could call it slapstick, a movie that would be considered a master piece in another era of movie making), you can see a very human drama.Not only that, but many human flaws that are on display here, that are hiding behind the comedy. What is not hiding though, is the phenomenal cinematography. The colors, the set pieces (designs) and the choreographed action is all in place here. There's even symbolism here, that I didn't catch (read some of the other reviews for that, the ones with a spoiler tag). A movie that you can enjoy as a silly comedy, or as a high concept drama ... or of course dismiss entirely as ""silly""."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"It's my first review on IMDb, because I was riled by cheeky Chinese media. For the sake of their own investment movie ""shi yue wei chen"", they criticized ""San Qiang"" was dirty, depraved and evil rubbish. It's ridiculous. Although wrapped in absurd comedy, the movie is serious and tragedy fable in essence. As we know, the movie is based from Coen Brother's movie ""Blood Simple"", Director Zhang enriched the plot and adjusted the role's character, which made the story more compact and delicate, but the theme ""Sometimes seeing is believing maybe wrong"" was kept. As stand-by, we know the whole process; As the party, they were all treated as the experiment objectives. I appreciated the details of this movies, I wish my explanation could help the views to understand the story better:1.Why the wife of boss only accepted the quoted price of 3 Guan for the gun not 4 or more? It just took the boss 3 Guan and 800 wen to buy his wife, the wife could not admit the value of the gun is higher than herself, so she only offered 3 Guan.2.Please pay attention to the bell over the cashbox, which was touched twice by the killer and counterjumper. Both of them were dead at last. The bell reminds me of the novel ""For Whom the Bell Tolls 3.Some people said they could not understand why the killer used arrow not falchion to kill Li Si. One side the arrow will be more secluded than falchion, on the other hand, as Chinese proverb goes ""It is easy to dodge a gun thrust in the open , but difficult to guard against an arrow shot from hiding.""4.""15 guan"" which is not only a figure the killer quoted, but also honor to Chinese traditional opera""15 Guan"", which is a miserable tragedy.Gernerally speaking, the movie is full of symbolistic things. If you are immersed in the movie, you would be find more fun.The visual effect of the movie is stunning and created a absurd drama world. I was impressed by the amazing feeling and become a fan of director.Perhaps the movie is not perfect, but it is so precious for an old man of good reputation to try a new style at his 60s', so I gave it 10/10."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Did you know that Yimou Zhang remade the Coen Brothers' ""Blood Simple"" in China? In some quarters it's known as ""Yimou Zhang's Blood Simple"" while elsewhere it has been rechristened ""A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop"". Yimou, of course, was at one time a director to be reckoned with, perhaps more famous internationally than even the Coens are now, (his ""Raise the Red Lantern"" is one of the masterpieces of world cinema), so we had every right to have had high hopes of this remake of what was a brilliant, if minor, Coen Brothers classic. Unfortunately, this is much closer to a black farce with none of the terror of the first ""Blood Simple"".Visually it's a terrific looking film, which is as we might expect from its director. Few directors in the history of cinema have used colour as expressively as Yimou but there's no substance here. This is just a piece of pulp fiction Chinese-style with the comedy falling flat and the suspense singularly lacking. Today the Coen Brothers' film is now considered one of the great debuts in American film and it will be remembered as such long after this is forgotten."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"'A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Chinese remake of the Coen brothers first film 'BLOOD SIMPLE', this one is set in 19th century China as opposed to 1980's Texas. The film is directed by Yimou Zhang (who directed such popular and critical acclaimed films as 'HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS', 'HERO' and 'CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER') and it's quite a departure from his older work. Zhang says 'BLOOD SIMPLE' is one of his favorite films and claims the Coens wrote to him after seeing his version and expressed how much they loved it. It's written by Jianquan Shi and Jing Shang and stars Ni Yan, Honglei Sun, Xiao Shen-Yang and Dahong Ni.The original Chinese title of the film is 'A SIMPLE NOODLE STORY', it was changed to 'A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP' for it's international release. It's set in a small desert town where a man named Wang (Ni) runs a successful noodle shop. He purchased his young beautiful wife (Yan) several years earlier and beats her every night. His wife is having an affair with a servant at the noodle shop named Li (Shen-Yang) and when Wang finds out about the affair things get ugly. Wang enlists the help of a local police detective (Sun) to help him carry out a plan of revenge. Things of course become complicated and bloody.The film is an odd mix of dark action thriller and screwball comedy. The slapstick jokes aren't exactly my taste in humor but the action scenes are cool and the suspense is intense. It does drag on a little here and there but for the most part the action / crime drama aspect of the film is effective. It's also often visually stunning with plenty of beautiful scenery and elaborate effects. It's not nearly as epic and breathtaking as Zhang's other films but I think it's a nice surprise change for him. By no means is it great or as classic as the original, of course, but it's still a remake worth checking out.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzuEs-uogc"
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"It's almost like history now talking about ZHANG Yimou's degenerating from quality films to trash like ""House of flying daggers"" (2004) and super-trash like ""Curse of the golden flower"" (2006). But at least there is ""Riding alone"" (2005) in which he tries to bring the audience a human story, although the style has a faint trace of Hollywood. ""Noodle Story"" is yet another welcome attempt from Zhang, a mixed bag of outlandish farce, black humour, dark tragedy and tense thriller.The opening credit clearly announces this movie as an adaptation from the Coen Brother's ""Blood simple"" (1984). In this adaptation, a solitary noodle shop in a forsaken wilderness on the Silk Road provides the theatre. The characters, though simple folks, are varied and not quite one-dimensional. The foxy, cheating wife of the owner turns out to be sympathy-worthy as one who has suffered for ten years under a sadistic Scrooge of a husband. Her sissy, sheepish young lover, one of the employees, later rises to the occasion when things get serious. The other two employees are more along the line of caricatures, but still caricatures with lives and characters of their own. There's also a villain with a menacing dark aura.Those who have seen ""Blood Simple"" will know that the plot is not complicated, but sufficient to generate scenes of various moods. This movie brings these scenes together without making the whole works look awkward. The casting is excellent. An extra bonus is the grotesque yet beautiful landscape that doesn't seem to belong to this Earth. The song and dance number during the end credit, which should not be missed, is probably inspired by Kitano's Zatoichi, which is probably inspired in turn by Bollywood."

三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"It starts just as a spaghetti western, but then comes a parody of spaghettis and samurai films with minimal use of dialogue and excessive extravaganza of imagery. While the scope of the film seems unbelievable, a little, simple story revolving some stupid stereotypes is going on. Starting with buying an imported gun, the premise recalls the emergence of modernism in traditional, moralist society as it happens in too many samurai ventures, but the concept is contrarily based on the consequences of reliance on such bad habits as greed and jealousy. Not as promising as his RAISE THE RED LANTERN and JU DUO, not inspiring as his LA VIE and HERO, Zhang Yimou's A WOMAN, A GUN AND A NOODLE SHOP is an eccentric experience by a cineaste assumed as a master: crazy, wild and frantic, but not trying to tell a story in the size of epic"
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop is acclaimed director Yimou Zhank's satire of the Coen Brothers' satire of film noir, Blood Simple. Although I am not a fan of Chinese humor because of its reliance on slapstick and hyperbole, it is filmed with a visual richness that Yimou has made his signature.Older husband abuses younger wife, who is being adulterous with a handsome, cowardly servant. Her purchasing a gun sets in motion a series of revenge activities that flesh out the Coen's title.The magnified close-ups and slow motion sequences accompanied by dazzling colors make a satisfying visual experience if the humor is just not that humorous."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"It's like this: Whether you know what goes into constructing a story because you've done so yourself or because you've just seen and/or read so many of them that the formulas are embedded in your mind, a lot of times it's tough not to look where they don't mean for you to look, the marionette wires maneuvering it, the groundwork holding it all up. When you remake a merely twenty-year-old cult classic by filmmakers with an enormous cult following, a story everybody knows, it's one thing to tell the story in a different style, or to change certain things, but anachronizing everything to an arbitrarily different time period, culture and characters, we are only really looking for all the anachronisms, waiting for them, being let down, occasionally being gratified.The time period is never specified, but what I expected was going to lead to interesting dramatic twists on the Coens' plot was that it begins with the sale of a gun, which the cheating wife and the ridiculous slapstick moron noodle-makers find foreign and unheard-of. The gun is apparently a pretty new invention. But Yimou, who normally cares profoundly about his characters, loses his passionate emotional dominion over his actors. He dries out the original's sultriness, trades humid night for arid day, and strains for slapstick. That would be perfectly fine if he traded those elements in for something just as or hopefully more effective, but he does not.The Coens' original Gothic film noir, fanged and toxic like snake venom, dwindles here to the point of amateur slapstick. Though the exterior shots make almost psychedelically atmospheric use of red and orange sandstone, day for night, sunrise and sunset, the characters are never more than ugly, overwrought cartoons. I'll admit that Blood Simple was not the quintessence of character arc. Nobody really seemed to change in that film, despite having a wryly farcical lack of conception as to what's happening. So at the outset of A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop, when the adulterous lover, originally played by John Getz, is a redefining coward, I was pleased, because, knowing what this character must later do, I felt I was in for a true character transformation. To describe the outcome without spoilers: No such luck.Aside from its inevitable comparison---one of the reasons, in hindsight, it's fated to be a letdown---Noodle Shop is simultaneously frantic and dull, with no hint of the restraint or meticulous concern with form exhibited in Yimou's own earlier blockbusters. Like Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower, and even as early as Ju Dou, the stars of the show are ultimately Zhao Xiaoding's mostly gorgeous cinematography, Tao Jing's evocative sound design and Yimou's choice of otherworldly locations. But all its visual brightness and tonal goofiness are far from either the literal or conceptual darkness of the fundamental story. Most damning is that the effort to recreate the remarkable final shot of Blood Simple is so tacky and clumsy that I reflexively sighed in revulsion. Zhang needs to reconnect with the fierce, principled, humanistic sensibility that made him one of China's finest film artists.So the result of this uneasy mix of ironic screwball affectation, particularly evident in the big comic close-ups, and Zhang's majestic but mostly show-offy imagery is triteness, artifice, unevenness, and pretension so immoderate and pointless as to have defiantly stylish interest. If the cast were comprised of John Waters, Elvira, Pee-Wee Herman and RuPaul, it would be less kitschy."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Yimou Zhang (Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower, and the Beijing 2008 Olympics Games Opening Ceremony) does things in a big way. I was interesting to see how he adapts a simple story of love and revenge, the Coen Brothers first film, Blood Simple.It may be a simple story, but when you add Chinese costumes and brilliant cinematography in the Gobi desert, the simplest film becomes spectacular.But, that won't save it as a story. Zhang just quite get the hang of the Coen Brothers. Characters come off looking like the Three Stooges.It is recommended simply to get the great master in action. Watch the original if you want to see an interesting movie."

The movie is far better than the source material (the movie BLOOD SIMPLE), which serves to point up the very thing that I mentioned. Old Wang is hilarious, as are the adulterous couple (one of whom happens to be Wang's beautiful young wife), and the crooked lawman he engages to do his dirty work. All too often, dumbed down American versions of superior foreign films are released in this country; rarely, indeed, do we find superior foreign versions of average (at best) American movies."

The normally brilliant Yimou Zhang comes up with a very odd remake of the Coen Brothers overrated movie Wise Blood. It's a strange, slapsticky black comedy with no consistency of character or tone. While there are good performances by Ni Yan and Honglei Sun, they don't really belong in the same movie, and neither performance fits with the very odd one from Xiao Shen-Yang. The slapstick is often too broad (although there's a brilliant comedic scene involving making noodles) and the quick shifts in mood seem unaccountable.All this movie has going for it are the visuals, which are stunning. It is a really amazing looking movie. But that's it."

My movie companion and I each thought of walking out early but didn't realize it until we compared notes at the end. I heard very few chuckles from the rest of the audience, so maybe everybody there wanted to leave long before the credits rolled. The characters were so cartoonish and one dimensional that I wasn't even interested in seeing what happened to them. It was like watching a Three Stooges movie that went on for far too long. It could have used some of the actual Stooges too, rather than the stooges who populate this lushly filmed laugh-deprived mess.Supposedly this is a remake of Blood Simple. I didn't see Blood Simple.

三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Right, well ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" (aka ""San qiang pai an jing qi"") is not exactly your average Chinese movie. So chances are that the movie may be a swing and a miss for people in the audience.I had not heard about this 2009 movie from director Yimou Zhang before 2020, when I was given a chance to sit down and watch it. Needless to say that I took the chance, as I thoroughly enjoy Asian cinema. Plus, a movie that I haven't already seen is also a factor that will make me sit down to watch it.Now, the storyline in ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" was a little bit weird, I will say that much. But oddly enough, I found that approach for the storyline to actually be interesting, because it set the movie aside from many other movies to make it from the Chinese cinema. At times, though, it felt like the movie was dragging on, as not all that much was actually happening throughout the course of the storyline.The movie was actually nicely carried by the acting performances of Shenyang Xiao, Ni Yan and Honglei Sun - all performers that I wasn't previously acquainted with.All in all, ""A Woman, A Gun and A Noodle Shop"" managed to be slightly more than an average movie. It wasn't a masterpiece, nor was it utter rubbish. I am rating the movie a six out of ten stars."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"Alright, the summary is a conscious echo from the title of a Tolstoy story, namely ""How much land does a man need?"" The plot line of the story is easy: old man acquires land, becomes possessive of it, gets an offer from the neighboring Bashkirs, that is the extremity of land he can walk to and return to his starting point in a day will be his. He gives it a try and almost succeeds. Being totally exhausted he drops dead when he returns and is buried in a six feet long grave. That's how much land a man needs.But while Tolstoy's story is more of a sketch than a story, or a parable, Yimou is intentionally operatic on the visual level. But to what purpose, since he employs only six actors with three or four extras? Six actors somewhat handled as Beckett would have, how can this escape being labeled a life-less bravura performance fuddling scale and purpose? Nothing to worry about if you let it all wash over you. For all its spectacle it is accurately, masterfully economic. The handling of the actors, ranging from the tradition of Chinese theater to Commedia del' Arte and spaghetti western codes is effective and lets the moral be and breathe, grim and outrageous at once: who would relieve his bowels on - his finally, due to the fallen sachet - grave? Who would have thought that his colleague, to call him that, existing seemingly for comic relief in the film, would be another sardonic knot in the rope of continuous miscalculation greed who tightens around everybody's careless, comic thrust and strangles greed and alibi together? Alibis are the others' half-read alibis, while greed is one's own blind-spot; it is only the killer-cop who tries obsessively to restore the patterns of the objects prior to the crime, as if to extinguish his involvement, while actually he proves that this is impossible: no matter how hard one tries, the alibi will always rhyme with crime.It is all more delicious then, that in the end Yimou avoids continuing his tale with what Wang's wife would do: the killer-cop is dead, and this is as economic it should be.Now, people complain that the lush, surely color-filtered if not digitally enhanced cinematography is there for its own sake; a spectacle at odds with the tale. I would agree with that, I even did at the beginning, comparing some takes and scenery with kitschy tourist souvenirs, but as the film moved on its warp, it seemed to me as an anamorphic distortion of the proceedings: otherworldly, sublimely indifferent, somewhat sickening in communicating us their splendor. And it is a distortion that fits with the final one that pops where the greedy and deadpan representative of the law meets his end in a deadly drop. This is how much story a man needs from a master of the craft."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"I saw this in the cinema yesterday without even knowing it was a Yimou Zhang movie, my friend told me afterwards that it was a Yimou film and i couldn't really believe him. It seems Yimou Zhang is looking for something new to do because is different that anything i've ever seen from him. To start with i haven't seen the original form the Coen brothers but this was pretty much a comedy with quite some slapstick and i don't know if the original is that way too. The film is OK but is missing what makes Zhang's previous movies good i cant put my finger on it but i didn't think Zhang did a great job on this, maybe because the fact he is new to comedy. The actors give a solid performance but can't lift the movie to higher heights its just an average movie for a boring Sunday to me.I must say i did get a few very good laughs out of it although sometimes in between the funny bits it seemed to turn into a drama which didn't really help it at all.Zhang perhaps could have focused on just the comedy or drama instead of trying to mix which didn't work out in the end. So in the end its an average movie but far below Zhang's capability as a gifted film maker."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"It's considered by the main stream media that this movie is a break-through of Zhang, as well as a master piece (yet another) of his too.However considered by most of the Chinese audience with common senses, to be nothing but crap.So do not believe what the media tells you, trust me, it's crap. If it's not for Zhang, the movie would be probably categorized as another low-budget amateur parody practice, only except the budget is not low at all.I watched this piece of crap only to see how lame it could get. I'm pretty satisfied to experience a fantastic one-and-a-half hour watching what I'd expected: Expensive crap - that's my final rating."
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"The original is junk. This one seems better. Sure, the colors, the camera, the fewer mistakes make it worth 4 stars on the IMDb scale. I mean, all this was in the House of the Flying Daggers with some more action and less of a stupid plot. For an advertisement to a detergent it would be a glorious 5 minutes, maybe even nicer than that famous 1984 Apple commercial. The sad part is that I used to enjoy this guy's movies. But Hero was the last high, now it's downhill for him. The good side is that China is rising in quality and it's way over the average Hollywood golden productions, so there must be another director waiting in line to keep up.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"I saw an earlier review on this page and the author had not seen the original film Blood Simple?This was beautifully filmed, a minor masterpiece. It was astounding to see the characters in their wonderful costumes. Beneath the heavens we are all, silly and clownish, stumbling through lives with little or no comprehension. Led by circumstance, fouled by desire and greed. The director was very faithful to the original 'Blood Simple' I would recommend this to anyone with a love of cinema, any seeker and/or students of life. Dark, gruesome and enough creeping suspense to make your gooses get pimples; all the while delivering many humorous moments.A truly amazing homage, and a delight on it's own.Loved this movie"
三枪拍案惊奇,"A Woman, a Gun and a Noodle Shop (2009)",,2009,2010.09.03,"I saw this film as a love song to the Coen brothers for their wry comedy _oeuvre_. Much like you can see _O Brother_ as a love song to country/bluegrass music; the Coens clearly are highly sophisticated musically, and can work their magic around this framework into a superb film.Note that it is _not_ a remake; _Blood Simple_ is hardly a comedy by any measure. It was just a starting point for Yang to hang his comedy on. And what a comedy it is! Elements of traditional Chinese film comedy: the slapstick, including the bumpkin assistant Zhao with the buck teeth; the hapless Li who finally finds his gumption; the remarkable acrobatics shots with the noodle preparation; the spunky little ingénue.The whole extended mime sequence near the end is pure Coen. The characters are gently satirized via their idiosyncratic behavior in the face of incongruous events (think Jeff Bridges in _Lebowski_.) Zhang shows us the universality of this kind of humor, born of Keaton in the silent era.Highly recommended!"
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"I'm a keen admirer of versatile Chinese director Feng Xiaogang and am a fan of his films, which covers quite a vast range from War (The Assembly), Period martial arts (The Banquet), and a good old thriller in World Without Thieves, amongst others in his filmography. I've yet to watch something that had disappointed, and his latest romantic drama If You Are The One starring long time collaborator Ge You and Shu Qi, proves to be yet another understated film that deserves a larger audience, if not for the limited number of screens (two only) in Singapore.Ge You plays Qin Fen, whom we are introduced as a one-time inventor of a product called the Conflict Resolution Tool, which got sold to a venture capitalist for millions. With his new found wealth, he decided to focus on settling down, and follows the recent trend of finding a suitable companion over the internet. Here's where the humour comes in, not in slapstick fashion, but through the earnest ways he presents himself with honesty, starting from his online profile which lists a number of his ordinary points quite upfront. Ge You is again at his element here, and he continues to surprise how he internalizes his roles, be it the grandeur of an emperor, or a straight-talking neighbour next door.Needless to say the best bits were in the first half, where like the 40 Year Old Virgin he goes on a schedule of blind dates after more blind dates, meeting countless of women with plenty of side agendas except settling down. His surprise comes in the form of Shu Qi's Xiaoxiao, because nobody would seriously expect a babe to hook up with someone through online means, given no lack of suitors already queuing up in the real world. I can trust a story written by Feng Xiaogang in that he crafts his characters with believability, and here he captures perfectly the essence of the dilemma of a middle aged man looking for a love partner. Knowing a below average joe would never be able to hold onto a relationship with a princess, given lack of funds, looks and power, Qin Fen passes up the chance quite honestly, but forms a firm friendship with Xiaoxiao.I guess Shu Qi's almost automatic first choice for a female lead role in a romantic film, having been seen very recently opposite Andy Lau in Look For A Star. While that role is a little more vivacious, her character here is a little more subdued, though no less glamorous as a stewardess with Hainan Air. Again she convinces with a credible performance of a woman who has this tremendous emotional baggage of being in love with a married man, who for obvious reasons cannot commit to her, nor wanting to let her go. She epitomizes Selfishness to the maximum, especially when deciding to trade and negotiate a relationship while knowingly still having a place in her heart for someone else, although credit given that she's upfront about it. What I particularly enjoyed about the film is its examination into seeking love through online means, where one has got to go through arduous ego-inflating profiles trying to seek out somebody for a blind date, which can turn out to be a tad disappointing when real life doesn't meet expectations set, no matter how small that is. The story excels, and is one of the key strengths of the film is in highlighting this disappointment. One can be magnanimous and make the best of the situation, or try to pull the plug as early as you can so as not to lead the other person on, or to waste everyone's time. It's all about having a little chance and taking risk at every possible opportunity presenting itself, and disappointments being just part and parcel of the process, especially when you have little brought to the table.Blessed with rich cinematography thanks to great locales in both China and in Hokkaido, Japan, look out too for plenty of cameos especially the blind dates that Qin Feng meets, the best (to me) was the short appearance of Vivian Hsu, who highlights once again some of the prejudices that any male would probably subscribe to as well. If there was a gripe, that will be the last scene which was quite unnecessary and too tacky, even though it was trying to make a not too subtle reference and statement to the real world financial crisis now, and the confidence to have in the Chinese financial system.I would only say to try not to miss this film despite the limited screens and timings, because this is certainly one movie that is worth its weight in gold. For those who cannot make it to the cinemas, the DVD is already out now, so you might just want to own it instead. Highly recommended, and goes into my shortlist of contenders for that end of year top movies list!"
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"I was surprised to see this movie that showed feelings I would have only expected in a Western film. After living in China for several weeks and feeling the large gulf between my culture in NW USA and Beijing, I found this movie quite refreshing. It showed me again that people are basically the same, given similar conditions. Dialogue was excellent - very well written and intense, although a little hard to follow by subtitles and watch the character's actions at the same time. The plot was not quite as predictable as a typical Hollywood film, which I also found refreshing. I look forward to watching more films by this director."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"The script is great, and well structured. You Ge's buoyant character is an essence to this film's success. The serious activities of a man who is successful in business and seeks for a good marriage are funny, but convincing, still we can understand he has fallen into romance with a girl played by Qi Shu. It is also funny and interesting to see a variety of girls as his opponents from the match-making website.I heard many Chinese tourists are now visiting Hokkaido, the north most part of Japan, as the location site of the film. Actually this location is well used and effectively involved.The opening scene might look a little bit strange, and I hope the future viewers do not turn it off because of this opening. After 15 minutes, the film starts rolling and the substance is funny, light but later warm and mild."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"""A sane, healthy woman,"" that's what Qin Fen(You Ge) is after, somebody ""emotional"", not the practical type. Well into his forties, this amateur inventor is remarkably self-assured and demanding for somebody this lonely. Only in the movies would a woman as beautiful as Smiley(Qi Shu) consider such an ordinary man. The flight attendant had seen Qin's ad in the personals and admired his no nonsense, almost anti-romantic description about what he's searching for. Stuck in a fatalistic relationship with a married man, Smiley wants friendship, not romance, so she follows the bald man out of the coffee shop and the rest is history. They become...platonic friends. Is it enough for Qin? No.Neither sane nor emotionally healthy, Qin makes allowances for Smiley, who has a sublime beauty that overrides the impracticality of being a consolation prize. ""Fei cheng wu rao"" is like an inverse of Garry Marshall's ""Pretty Woman"", in which the woman has the agency in their relationship. After asking Qin to marry her, Smiley sets the condition that she be allowed to keep a space in her heart for the married man. Why, the moviegoer may wonder, does Smiley restrict herself to a man she doesn't find sexually attractive? Like one of Qin's rejects(a stockbroker) says, Qin's value is depreciating. In other words, he's old and bald. But that's the movies for you, patriarchal through and through. The truth is out though, to the film's credit, in which the woman provides an honest assessment of Qin's desirability, because it punctures the movie myth that an average man can lure a ten into his heart. While neither Qin nor Smiley addresses the difference in their age, the narrative itself performs the task of batting its rhetorical eyelids at the math, indirectly, without being the least bit didactic about it.A change of scenery is the balm, Qin hopes, might be the salubrious fix-all to Smiley's broken heart, so the symbiotic couple travels to Japan, where the old man has a friend who drives his Chinese guests around Hokkaido. An unscheduled stop at a small Christian church leads to the old man divulging all of his sins to a priest. Starting with his transgressions as a small child, in a roundabout way, Qin admits his amorous feelings for Smiley is scandalous, but he never gets that far in the chronology. Worn out from Qin's unabridged cataloging of sins, the priest advises Smiley that she take her friend to the big church. To Qin, although he knows his relationship might be sinful, it's nothing that a small church can't handle in his estimation. But for others, a cross-generational pairing may seem lurid, therefore a big church is needed to absolve a big sin. While self-reflexivity is applied to the social phenomena of old man dating younger women, ""Fei cheng wu rao"" has nothing in common with feminism. Ultimately, the film sides with the small church, since Qin's friend lectures Smiley on the unfairness of it all, exploiting his friend's feelings with her convoluted conditions, he scolds. After all, exploitation can be a two-way street. Qin puts up with being angst-ridden because he likes his women young. It's a price he's willing to pay.Prior to their religious field trip, in the city district, the two men encounter a poster-sized photograph of four beautiful sisters, restaurant proprietors, whose erotic appeal lures them inside. To their surprise, however, the picture is out of date. They're old. Women who are out of circulation in Qin's estimation, as well as the film's ideology(The old ladies themselves laugh at their own lost sex appeal as women.) The geriatric women are the punchline to a set-up that's predicated on the filmic tradition of older virile men categorically disqualifying their female contemporaries as potential mates. The filmmaker infers that it's better for a man to be celibate than lie down with a mature woman. Sex is important to Qin, he says it's the basis for love, so when he turns down Smiley's one night of love(sex) with her, his perceived nobility of genuine emotions for the younger woman, obscures the fact that he's really just a dirty, old man."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"It's a film about romance, sad but mild at the same time. Permeated by numerous advertisement for the sponsors for the produce of this film, the story struggled to manifest its substance via Ge You's humorous( or flirtatious) dialogue( or monologue). A man (acted by Ge You) over forty wanted to find the ""Miss Right"", only to encounter various kinds of "" Miss Wrong"". A woman ( acted by Shu Qi) felt desperate at the affair with a married man happened to meet Ge You at a blind date. They got to know each other gradually and decided to pay a tour to the famous retort in Japan together as companion to each other and finally Shu Qi smells the odor she wants from his companion and realizes he is the true Mr Right. In the picturesque field, another emotion arising from friendship tried to trigger audience's innate desire to sob. As a comedy, the film brings us a good ending, touching. BTW, the music rendered by the winner of Super Girl is manifique."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"Why this film is described as a ""Romantic Comedy"" is beyond me. Although I'm American, my wife is Chinese, and grew up in Hong Kong, and she didn't see it as a comedy either, so I don't think it's just cultural differences here.Rather, this is a film about 2 sad people...Ge You as Qin Fen is a wealthy but lonely inventor without any tact or social skills who's looking for a wife through online dating sites. And Shu Qi as Smiley, the flight attendant who is in love with a married man who will never leave his wife for her. For some reason, these two unhappy people bond with each other, and try to help each other out.I remember that Jennifer Aniston in ""The Good Girl"" had her looks played down, and rarely smiled. This is similar to what they did with Shu Qi in this movie. Her jaw-dropping beauty and killer smile is rarely in evidence. Although Shu's getting older, she's not that old, and this role is definitely against type for what she typically does. This is even much different than her performance in ""Three Times.""The film is worth a look, but unfortunately, nothing too special."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"Yes, this is yet another one of those very generic romantic comedies that are mass-produced and all follow the same guidebook of how-to-make-a-successful-romantic-comedy.What made me sit down to watch this movie was solely because of Shu Qi. And she does an adequate job alongside You Ge, but they had so very little to work with by restrictions of a mundane script. And yes, this is one of those dislike-turns-to-love types of romantic comedies.The story is about 40-something year old Qin Fen (played by You Ge) who is desperately trying to find a wife by posting an add on the Internet. He happens to meet with Xiaox Xiaox (played by Shu Qi), but they are not compatible. Qin Fin is a recent millionaire and Xiaox Xiaox is trying to mend a broken Heart. As fate will have it their paths cross again and an odd friendship starts to bloom.The movie ran at just about two hours, which felt like an eternity towards the end. They should have cut away about 30 minutes to make it a movie that could sustain a hold on the audience.""If You Are the One"" (aka ""Fei cheng wu rao"") is not a memorable movie, unless you are a die-hard fan of anyone on the cast list. And there are far better choices of movies in this genre, should you be in the mood for a romantic comedy."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,"Well known Chinese actor, Ge You, plays a kind of geeky middle-aged man, an inventor, who after becoming rich, wants to fulfill his next ambition and get a girlfriend. The comedy aspect of the film is more successful as Ge You's character tries personal ads and meets with several unsuitable candidates. One of the candidates (played by Qi Shu) is an air flight attendant who is unsuitable in many ways including still being in love with another man who has rejected her. Despite mutual animosity, they develop a kind of twisted friendship and agree to help each other. Predictably they become more attracted to each other but have to overcome difficult obstacles to find real love. The comedy is kind of goofy and slapstick but sometimes amusing with some humorous but pointed criticisms of modern Chinese life. However, the more romantic second half of the film is overwrought and increasingly unbearable to watch as Qi Shu's character struggles with herself and Ge You's character becomes increasingly tolerant of her self torment. bleeech."
非诚勿扰2,If You Are the One (2008),,2008,2010.12.24,I don't like this movie. It has many places to stab me. It's absurd and warm. I can't call it a bad movie against my will
我知女人心,Wo zhi nv ren xin (2011),,2011,2011.02.03,"Andy Lau and Gong Li are two of the most attractive and charismatic superstars of their age and it's a perfect dream match in this romance comedy. However the film itself fails terribly and is considered mediocre at best, putting such great cast potential to a pitiful waste. The best reward is a visual treat of two fabulous personalities trying to work chemistry on the big screen.After walking out of the theatre from this film, a raging question enveloped me.""How did two of the greatest Asian superstars agree to such a lacklustre film?""Most of us will have to admit that it is such a pleasure to have them on the same big screen as it surely satisfies audience members of both genders and thus holding great opportunities to appeal towards a massive audience size. Whenever I see Andy Lau working his charms on a well-composed Gong Li, it makes me wonder why youthful couples are always featured where you only get sweet puppy love and none of the enriched personalities sported by these two timeless veterans.Nevertheless, there is only that much these superstars can aid a bad film.What Women Want follows Benny Chan's successful remake of Hollywood's ""Cellular"" in another Asian attempt at similar, this time of a romance comedy genre. However it is interesting to see the project being entrusted into someone who is inexperienced with bid budget productions, which proves to be fatal indeed.Poorly scripted and handled, it is said that it retains a high level of adherence to the original. Possibly a source of creativity and flair deadlock as the filmmakers are merely trying to shadow an original without any new blood to improve or innovate.Almost every scene is briefly tackled on screen and soon after fleets towards the next, causing the film to feel like a superficial work of neither style nor substance. The audience will find themselves trying hard to attach themselves to the cast as much as they love to (Lau and Li are simply hard to ignore).As a romance comedy, there isn't any quality comedy in it unfortunately to compensate for the lack of good romance chemistry between both leads. Aside from the occasional whacky stint by Andy Lau who dresses up in feminine fashion in the first half of the film, dialogues were pretty much one-two liners that were shallow and uninspiring.The best parts of the film can be easily gathered as follow:1. Eye candy in the form of gorgeous Gong Li and charming Andy Lau. 2. Andy Lau sings.If these two aspects do not appeal to you in any manner, feel free to skip this film that tries hard to know what women want and has seriously neglected what the audience wants.This is clearly not a good Valentine's Day film to indulge in with your partner (It's an annual event and thus don't risk spoiling it for your other)."
我知女人心,Wo zhi nv ren xin (2011),,2011,2011.02.03,"A superficial remake of Hollywood counterpart...Although, What Women Want is what you proclaim as efficient, it is not a movie that affects or has any effect on you. At least that is the case, if you have seen the far superior Hollywood movie starring Mel Gibson. The problem is not the story, but rather the way the film is directed. There is absolutely no creativity or ambition, instead what the audience receive is a safe scene by scene re-dux into Chinese. If not for the attractiveness and on-screen presence of the leads, Andy Lau and Gong Li, the film would be almost unwatchable. With the two, What Women Want gets attention and with attention comes a decently made, polish production values and purely commercialised Mainland product.One of the Achilles heels of this movie is the pairing of Gong Li and Andy Lau. There is absolutely no love chemistry in the pairing. If there is any sort of chemistry it will be that of brotherly and sisterly love. In effect, the film is doomed to have any chance of real success when the main romantic leads fail the first hurdle. In saying that, whenever the two is on-screen, there is an automatic ""big star"" presence about them. This not only lifts the movie up a notch, but makes the film a watchable affair from start to finish without lurking into boredom.All in all, What Women Want is not a bad movie, in fact is more into the positive territory than not. The fact is that it is inevitable that any remake will be compare with its predecessor and in this case, the Hollywood original actually worked in all departments and even manages to convince. Sometimes, a safe bet is reasonable, but to copy scene by scene, it just lacks any sort of creativity that could have made the film better than it is. Using the idea and premises of knowing what women is feeling rather than a carbon copy can be a start. Still, What Women Want is an efficient and largely average entertain that does not ignite or fails. Watch the original, before indulging into this hugely average affair...(Neo 2011) I rate it 6/10www.thehkneo.com"
我知女人心,Wo zhi nv ren xin (2011),,2011,2011.02.03,"I (a falang American) watched this out of curiosity, to see what a Chinese version of this sort of movie is like. Obviously one can't generalize from one movie, but all I can say it that, for the sake of Chinese audiences, I hope that most of their Rom Com directors are more skilled than Daming Chen. Regarding the movie itself, I'll repeat the comments of most other reviewers. Gong Li is as gorgeous as ever, but that's all she is --- a pretty face that exists to move the plot along. Andy Lau's character, on the other hand, is not neutral but vile. And he doesn't get better as the movie progresses --- he's the same dick at the end that he was at the beginning. It's not just that there's no chemistry between the two, it's that you don't want chemistry between them. Also don't expect any laughs along the way --- this fits the Rom Com mold, but has none of the comedy that could be wrung from the situation. The budget (as suggested by the stars, the decent lighting and costumes, the sets/locations) suggest a high-end movie, but the actual content --- everything from the clumsy and didactic story to the lack of humor or subtlety --- suggests the sort of sad movies you see on an indie TV channel late at night starring Hollywood hopefuls you've never heard of, in some direct to DVD garbage. What is interesting is the image of China it presents. The buildings shown are all incredibly new and, while I expect the intention was to present some sort of air of glamor, to me it felt extremely nouveau riche. The buildings struck me as not so much Manhattan as Brasilia --- designed based on theory rather than on human needs, and likely to be showing cracks and flaws in just a few years. There's one scene where we see our heroine in a car driving down a highway which struck me as the one scene where Chinese reality enters --- the highway is lousy and narrow, with few cars on it --- something like what the Pasadena Freeway may have looked like when it opened in 1940, and nothing at all like the general highways of Los Angeles today. The second image of China it presents is of a country that has not yet undergone the ""psychologicalization"" of America. The characters seem unable to relate to each other or discuss their inner lives in a way that Americans (helped by TV and movies) had already achieved by the early 70s or so. The clumsiness of the dialog doesn't help, sure, but it seems that there's more than that, that the screenwriter honestly doesn't know (or at least doesn't expect the audience to know) how to be introspective, how to have a theory of mind, how to interpret other people. They go through the motions (we get the occasional sermon on ""being honest"") but there's no follow-through, no appreciation of the relevant issues. You get the feeling that if you told the Andy Lau character to be vulnerable, to honestly communicate, he'd have no idea what that even meant; or that if you told Gong Li's character that she allows herself to be a doormat, she'd not understand the point you were making."
我知女人心,Wo zhi nv ren xin (2011),,2011,2011.02.03,"The release of films here is getting quite predictable in the first two months of the year, with releases primed for the Lunar New Year weekend with plots that are family friendly comedies, and everything else that's on the Golden Globes and Oscar list of nominees. In between there's the Valentine's Day programme with romantic comedies such as Just Go With It, No Strings Attached and also this remake of the Hollywood film starring Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson before he self-destructed his career. Before we proceed I thought you may want to know I've never watched the original, since I was never convinced Gibson could be a romantic lead, and as it turns out he's more action packed than lovey-dovey in his real life exploits too.But back to this Pan-Chinese production, starring Singaporean Gong Li (I could say that, couldn't I?) and Malaysian PR Andy Lau as they take on the roles played by Hunt and Gibson respectively, where their characters Li Yi-Long and Sun Zi Gang are professional rivals in the advertising arena, who slowly find themselves drawn to each other romantically since they spend countless of hours in office in their dog eat dog profession. From their swanky office in Beijing to equally chic looking chill out watering holes - there's always the guzzling of wine in almost all their scenes together, talk about the affluence and a little bit of alcohol to withstand each other's nerves and charms - they find that they do actually click, but only because Zi Gang has a secret so powerful, I'm sure all men want to have that same ability, perhaps minus the need to be zapped by one point twenty one jigawatts.Zi Gang is the atypical ladies man, a smooth talker who knows how to rub women the right way and into his bed. Being the high flying creative director in a female dominant office, he gets every attention every day and is thought to be primed for the executive role, only for his company to hire Yi-Long from a rival agency, because the market as it seems is seeing the rise in the power of the female dollar, and the company is of the opinion of having a female at the helm would boost their chances. Talk about being sexist here.Things chug along and a freak accident while getting in touch with his feminine side (anima) gives Zi Gang the ability to listen in on the thoughts of all females, which while being thought of as a curse in the initial stages, becomes weaponized as a tool in the market place as he susses out opinions, ideas and especially strategies as cooked up by his rival Yi-Long. It's espionage at the highest and most subtle of levels, and the use of this power also extends to trying to improve ties with his rebellious teenage daughter, which is one of three subplots that unnecessarily bloats the plot and running time, the other two being the relationship between Zi Gang and his dad who irritates the bejesus out of everyone in the old folks home with his breakfast morning soprano singing, and a needless romance with a barista who's more eye candy than anything else.The best part of the movie is of course the countless montage sequences set during Zi Gang's initial confusion as he navigates through countless of sexists (but are they accurate?) thoughts from the fairer sex, which provided for some light comedy contrasting against the very heavily rote romantic set pieces. But these moments are few and far between especially when the romantic angle starts to muscle its way in to the second half of the film, when the concept and premise start to wear thin. Some parts also don't make much sense, and a few stem from the business perspective, such as how nobody within the industry know how the hotshots or peer competitors look like, or how the financial difficulties of the firm you're joining is not well researched into and got blindsided, or even how the hiring and firing policies of the company don't make much HR sense either.Andy Lau and Gong Li do share some chemistry as potential rivals and corporate competitors, though Lau looked visibly aged while I have to admit the latter looked more radiant in her role. There's nothing in the characters to challenge these two veteran performers, though you can take a sneak peek into their NG sequences when the end credits roll to give an idea which were some of the parts that they tripped up.You can tell that writer-director Chen Daming relied heavily on the Hollywood sensibilities in crafting this film, right down to the predominant English songs in the soundtrack. But what got delivered was an average fare that didn't quite excite or ignited a sustainable interest in its overly long run time, and coupled with some really slipshod CG which will unfortunately distract (check out that ""fish in the tank"" when Zi Gang stands out in the pouring rain)."
我知女人心,Wo zhi nv ren xin (2011),,2011,2011.02.03,"(...However I believe you can still enjoy the US version after watching this one;-) If you saw neither 2000 original, nor 2011 remake, stop reading here and go watch the original.In the beginning about me: I am not Chinese and I saw 2000 original. This things made me probably evaluate the movie lower than others. In other words, Chinese patriot who didn't see original would enjoy the movie better.The reason I made TODAY IMDb registration just to write this review, was someone mentioning somewhere without seeing the original, that this movie is probably better because Mel Gibson is more action hero than romantic actor. (I am simplifying here) Not true. And I had to mention it. Imho, Mel Gibson did good job acting as well as other actors in the original movie.I admit I don't know Chinese culture, so there can be some entertaining things I am missing. I also was not as comfortable watching the subtitles as it would be with English audio. Although English is not my native language, I dare to say that either the dialogs are shallow (I am sorry), or more probably the translation to English subtitles was bad. Not as bad as in early eastern martial arts movies, however, in that kind of movie it didn't matter that much.The story itself: I consider it the worst handled remake I ever saw. But the producers probably thought that there is like one billion people in China who didn't see the original and will like it. I would say there are several types of scenes in this move here is my breakdown: 1) scenes copied exactly (I had no entertainment here, because it was exactly same as original) 2) scenes slightly simplified (20% simplification of the scene usually means like 80% of humor reduction) 3) scenes with small additions (usually stupid) 4) scenes completely changed, removed, added...(probably done because otherwise the similarity of the remake would be too bad...however, I cannot recall any change of that kind which increases the quality of the Chinese version)To have an example what I mean by 2 and 3, here is short dialog from the movie (very shortened - not word to word). This will NOT SPOIL the entire movie: Boss: What do you think about the graphics? (both versions) She thinks: (is thinking about them and he hears it) (both versions) He: (answers exactly what she thinks) (both versions) She thinks: How can he think same as me??? (Chinese only, in US version mimics only which is much better: does the Chinese director think the audience is stupid?) Boss: Good idea, hey come to my office later, I have new cubans. (both versions)He: Cool. (both versions) She: OK. (US only) Boss: You smoke cigars? (US only) She: No. (US only: this is what makes it funny, otherwise mentioning he cubans is just empty smalltalk)I was going to watch the movie, because I considered the original pretty entertaining and I thought the Asian version would be entertaining in different way. WRONG. Howgh."
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"Epic story of two military strategists both in love with the same woman.Its an epic action/romance filled with lots of crashing armies, tons of computer generated images, freeze frame action sequences and a sense that that it was done on the cheap by TV people. I could be wrong of course simply because it just may have been done cheaply, but the feel seems to match TV drama at times.The action sequences seem wildly scaled down despite being massively huge with the result that they are epic to look at but not particularly exciting (I won't go into the dullest chariot race I've ever seen with the chariots moving at different speeds in different shots) The other problem I have is that the film seems to be larger than the confines of the story. There were times when I had the sense that I was missing something.Its not a bad film, but with all of the epic films coming from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan I'm forced to wonder how this film was chosen to get a release in the US- on the same day as its release in Asia"
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"For viewers expecting a history lesson from the onset, you might be disappointed, the opening of the feature, though bloody and action oriented at times, being reminiscent of stereotypical comedy. It isn't until much later, when the dramatic elements consume almost the entirety of the plot, that The Warring States is revealed to be a thought-provoking narrative, that remains with you long after the credits have rolled, the many tragedies depicted in the film reflecting how, after so many centuries, people continue to repeat similar atrocities.From the beginning, the characters remain unchanging in their philosophies, the creators never forcing these individuals to be anything they are not, though at the same time, they are highly unrepresentative of historic fact. The costumes, so beautiful and elegant, could be one of the only accurate depictions the film manages to occasionally conceive, while the use of color adds, both vividly and morosely to the emotional climate exhibited in the scenes. The environments on the other hand deliver varying landscapes, from snow caped mountains, to tranquil forests and large, grassy knolls, making for some startling scenery.The score is especially notable, its presence in a number of the scenes being beautiful and majestic, adding comfortably and favorably to the narrative's progression. The theme song, Wind, sung by Jing Tian, who I will happily discuss in broader depth later, is equally captivating in this regard. During the fight scenes, the music accompanies the intensity and brutality of these moments, which are as well choreographed as they are attention-grabbing, the blood that flows out from the many wounds fiercely articulating the horrors of the battlefield, whilst maintaining its visually entertaining influence.Indefinably set during the fifth and third centuries BC, in which the states of Qi and Wei are disputing about territories and power, the film opens at its conclusion, with Sun Bin (Sun Honglei), gazing at the natural wonder stretched out before him, while reminiscing about the beauty of Tian Xi, a young woman he admires. Questions regarding why his thoughts dwell upon her at this moment, and where she might be, immediately grasp the viewer's attention.There is no doubting the intellect of Sun Bin's character, who finds himself caught between the two states, each desperately seeking his guidance, who revere him for having been taught by strategist Sun Tzu, however, the interpretation provided by the actor and creators, seems remarkably contradictory. Continuously laughing and grinning, Sun is an ignoramus, with delusions of peace, which, in the period the film is set, is an unaffordable luxury. Tian Xi describes Sun as been 'such a fool', and how else would you describe a man who continues to refer to someone as their ally, even after they have horrifically tortured them? Resembling the Disney character Goofy for much of the feature, after experiencing great suffering, Sun goes from grinning in almost every scene, to wearing a long face while mumbling lines of dialogue, this stark contrast, strangely enough, making him quite a sympathetic individual.Furthermore, this particular characterization, alongside lines such as 'time for suicide!' by assassins who have been discovered by the enemy, sometimes fails to inspire confidence in the characters, or the script. Alongside Sun moreover, is his blood brother Pang Juan (Francis Ng), who, in contrast with the lead, is interestingly constructed, equally employing jealousy, arrogance, friendliness and reason, developing an individual who, although antagonistic, has multiple interpretative sides to his character. His sister, Pang Wan'er (Kim Heui-Seon) however, though deserving additional screen time, is more sympathetic and compassionate, being one of the few characters who, like Sun, vies for peace.Married to the Wei Emperor, Wan'er is frequently seen looking out for the interests of others, unlike so many of the male characters, who only ever look out for themselves. Although much of the narrative is comprised of male leads, the men are often seen in the rear of any confrontation, or hiding away behind the walls of their cities, the women on the other hand being capable, opinionated, and powerful, this description especially fitting with Tian Xi (Jing Tian), the future queen of Qi.Although young, and potentially not quite as recognizable in contrast with the other leads, for the most part, Ms. Tian often appears to steal the show - she can act, she can sing, she can dance - is there anything this woman can't do? Always appearing elegant, even on the field of battle, where she is as graceful as she is athletic, Tian is as much a strategist as her male counterparts, professionally demonstrating talent with the dramatic elements of the film, a scene where she is in tears being especially powerful. On more than one occasion, Tian is provided unnecessary material, the likes of which the men are not subjected to, where she either inexplicably coughs, and during one scene forgets what she wanted to say, often appearing as a giggling, gamine, child, rather than the royal warrior she proves herself to be.The romantic sub-plot, although in any other feature of similar genre may seem peculiar, never feels forced or out of place, instead capturing a gentle, child-like innocence that makes it appear so sweet and charming, granting the audience the ability to hope for a beautiful outcome. However, the anti-climatic conclusion, which leaves several questions unanswered, renders the film, which begins to speed up towards the end, feeling incomplete, as though there was more to be said, but it was instead silenced. Quite unlike many other Chinese features set within this period, The Warring States offers a strangely different, yet nostalgically captivating film, that may sometimes annoy and irritate, but will leave you quietly contemplating the touching narrative."
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"A lot of epic movies has been made in China in the last years, some good and some forgettable. This one falls into the second category. The story is about a strategist disputed between two Chinese kingdoms. Although intelligent, he is very naive. In one reign he falls in love with a girl, general of the army and destined to marry the emperor, in the other he is betrayed and imprisoned by his old friend, also a military strategist and in love with the same girl too. He succeeds to escape and lead the first reign to victory, but in the end he will kill himself. The movie seems to have been done in a hurry, sometimes things happen too fast and you feel like you're missing something in the plot. There's a lot of computer effects but they're not so good. The fighting scenes are intended to be epic but they often result confused and so not exciting. It's not a good movie, but not the worst of its kind. There's a plenty of better Chinese movies, so it remains a mystery why it was distributed in the West. Anyway, if you like the genre, you can take a look: surely you'll forget it soon after."
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"If you are looking for a Hollywood style movie, then this is probably not the one for you. It is a typical Chinese drama but with some interesting notations. Like many Asian stories, this movie is told in a circular fashion. Most China movies contain very silly comedic scenes and this one is no different, at least initially. The movie progresses through a time period and is based on true historical account, and from what I have read online, is pretty darn accurate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Bin's_Art_of_War I didn't care for the war scenes or excessive violence, but there were some deeper underlying principals and prelates that the movie is trying to convey. I suppose you need to decide for yourself if this truly happens. Towards the end, I couldn't help but take an interest in the fate of the characters, but there were no surprises here as how it turned out or how people acted; although human nature as portrayed by the main antagonist,Pang Juan, and the Qi's main general, is rather harsh and cruel. Half of the movie is sad and depressing as the main character betrayed by his ""brother"", tortured, lamed, and then suicidal, goes from a cheerful disposition to a serious, reflective personality and loses the naive innocence he has. He eventually ends his life so he will no longer be forced by either country to continue in developing strategies for war. What makes this movie watching for me is the historical significance as it is not just an imaginary plot set in this time period but real events that have taken place."
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"OMG, what a terrible movie! I rarely found a Chinese movie so disgusting! The screen writer(s) should be sentenced to a life ban from writing any more screenplays, the director of this movie should also be banned from directing any new movie! Two of the major characters who played the pupils of the military strategy master are perhaps the worst mis-casting jobs ever done any existing casting agency. The dialog, OMG, is one of the worst and the most ridiculous dialogs ever written by a screenplay writer. I have noticed that this movie would be singled out in this year's Cannes Movie Festival to be reviewed. What a shame that Chinese would have picked such a lousy movie to participate this important movie festival, definitely an insult to both of the French and the Chinese. This is the movie that viewers/audiences should walk out of the viewing theater and to have a more meaningful and productive lives. Don's waste one minute or even one second on this horrible movie. I have walked out of the theater urged by my wife when we visited China recently. It's a nightmare!"
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,"I disagree with one previous comment made for this movie saying it is a nightmare. Surely that is a comment of an ignorant, Hollywood movie junkie who does not understand biographic movies with a bit of dramatic touch to it. The director's effort to make the movie a bit dramatic is enough for a typical Hollywood movie junkie to understand that the director is trying to give you guys a vivid description of sun bin's life and sufferings. Naked, not sugar-coated reality, is the difference of oriental movies from typical sugar-coated Hollywood ones. If you are the type of person who is not into logical, non-fiction, oriental movies and you are always after happy endings (boring), this movie is not for you. Clearly, it's not for the teeny little brain of the other guy there who commented ""it's a nightmare"". Anyway, overall good movie. There are missed-out parts like the face branding etc and the additional dramatic suicide of sun bin but yep, it's there for the little-brained ones like that ""nightmare"" guy who needs his Hollywood fix."
战国,The Warring States (2011),,2011,2011.04.22,Sun committed suicide at the battlefield is total fabrication of history. Sun's acting is so stupid. Why the director wants to convey the stupidity of Sun?
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"THE GREAT REVIVAL is a lively retelling of early 20th century China, a tumultuous period where the old ways and the new ways collided and many factions seemed to continually war with each other in a bid for power. It's a complex and sometimes epic-feeling production, so I'm surprised to see it rated so low here on the IMDb.I suspect the reason is that it's a blatant piece of propaganda, with Mao Zedong portrayed as a crusading hero; the story stops before the later troubles that surrounded his career. Now, I'm not bothered by watching propaganda films; I've seen plenty of North Korean efforts and, let's be honest, America makes their own share of flag-waving guff. Propaganda alone isn't a reason to rate a film down.THE GREAT REVIVAL isn't a perfect film and anybody trying to keep track of all the main characters will soon be scratching their heads in puzzlement. Still, it's an expansive and expensive-looking production, and it's never boring even if some of the material seems extraneous or glossed over too quickly. The stuff with the students riots is particularly watchable, and spotting all of the familiar faces from Chow Yun-Fat to Daniel Wu, Fan Bingbing, Andy Lau, Simon Yam, and even John Woo, is a delight in itself."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,This film starts with the 1911 xinhai revolution and quickly goes over the chaos of the early republic and its trouble with Yuan shi-kai. The May 4th movement is portrayed as the touchstone to the founding of the communist party (certainly a lot of the future leaders of the party started getting involved in politics at this time). This could have been a much longer film covering more in depth coverage of the personalities of this time and still have my interest because of my study of Chinese history. For a general audience this film may have too many characters they know nothing about and find confusing. Even more so if you are not Chinese or a student of this time in history. How many people know about the Japanese occupation of the Shandong peninsula and its impact on Chinese thinking about the west? If you do have some knowledge of the people and time in China during the years covered in this film you will enjoy this movie.
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"OK, so here we have Beginning of the Great Revival. When I hear the word revival thus used, I think of religious shows in tents, but here it refers to the revival of China in the 20th Century. The significance of the ""beginning"" is, of course, that China owes its rapid and grand rise economically to the Communist Party, whose beginnings the story relates. The early parts of the film begin with the fracturing and collapse of the Qing Dynasty in China, then of course the brief time of Yuan Shikai, played by Chou Yun-fat as we know him in the West. Quickly we see the developing power of the corrupt Nationalist Party, and then a good part of the film is devoted to the young Mao Zedong. Mao appears to be a man who had the misfortune of being born with a receding hairline, with hair that naturally parts in the middle of his head. Joking aside, Mao is portrayed as an earnest and amiable young student who, after a very brief stint at Beijing University, returns to his home province of Hunan to help found the Chinese Communist Party. We meet his first wife, see their budding romance (no kissing), and see them go off to lead a life that was happy until Mao spotted his next love (not shown in film), and then the next, and the next...If this all sounds like boring history stuff, that's because it's what most of this film is. There are no real surprises. We get a communist party view of historic events, complete with footage from Sergei Eisenstein's dramatization of the Bolshevik coup d'etat in Russia that was never quite the revolution depicted in Eisenstein's film. Much of the Beginning of the Great Revival seems to be an endless series of speeches--much loved by communist party leaders--some dramatic, some affected, mostly dull, interspersed with a few dramatic scenes of combat or mass demonstrations. To be honest, I forced myself to watch this film to the end, and once was more than enough."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Know at the start I've over rated this film a point or two simply because the film is nowhere near as bad as the rating of 2.3 readers have given this film.This film is a telling of the founding of the communist party from the point of the 1911 revolution on to the the actual founding. Its a star studded flag waiving puff piece put together by official Chinese authorities.A great film to look at the film could have and should have been a masterpiece of more than the technical arts.The problem is that the films march to compress several decades of complex history into a couple of hours makes the film a highlight reel where we get clips of events which have the significance explained by titles on the screen. The result is not the living history they were aiming for, but rather it's a dull museum piece... or a lesser History Channel special. I kept waiting for Edward Hermann's narration to kick in and explain the away the slow spots.On some level I kind of liked the film, but more because it gave me some basic understanding of the events that transpired. I completely understand that the film is tinged with pro-Communist propaganda but at the same time much of it is clearly visible...and beside things move so fast you'd have to be crazy to completely accept that this is everything that happened.Worth a look see for those with an interest in Historucal epics... then again I'd go for the much better Founding of a Republic if given the choice."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"The reviews for this movie are too much plagiarized by US propaganda (rating this as 1) and Chinese propaganda (rating it as 10). If you take an unbiased view from a normal Chinese people, it's just a rather average movie. Hey, let's rate a movie based on its merit, the impression it gives people and so on, not just by politics!The initial scenes are a bit dull and disconnected with the whole story. The film fails to tell the story of Tao Chengzhang (the guy with the bomb, later get murdered) at all so these scenes should be cut-off completely, just a waste of minutes.After that it went quite fine with the story of Yuan Shikai (Chow Yun- fat) and Cai E (Andy Lau), it's quite touching to see General Cai could barely stand but still directs the victory over Yuan who elected himself as the emperor. And the Mao Zedong (Ye Liu) line is also OK and quite touching.The May fourth movement part is a performed very well. For a Chinese, it reminded of a story the government often fails to tell. The tensions with the Japanese about the invasion of Shandong, the government's inability to make diplomatic maneuvers, and the fanatic approach of the students. I would say that's a nice historical lesson to take, especially in nowadays China where student movement is mostly a banned topic (because of the 89' Tiananmen square accident). Some of the speeches of Chen Duxiu (Feng Yuanzheng) are well carried out indeed, that it feels like the audience in the film were really convinced by him and were fully supporting his ideas.However, the government side could be strengthened a bit. It talks about Wellington Koo (Daoming Chen) and his diplomatic efforts, but these were cut too heavily so the full story was not told very clearly.Then the final scenes are not so good. The story lacks a climax and it looks to have ended without any major thing happening. OK the CCP formed, secretly while being hunted down by the police but so what? That ending can definitely be strengthened quite a bit. A few scenes on the things that happened in the next years, or a mere history time-line will make the epic feeling much better.Overall, the film is ambitious in trying to condense 10 years of history into a mere 2 hours. But that turns out to be a bit too ambitious so in the end many things are told by just hand-waving. It could be made better by cutting off some of the less relevant scenes and making the main plot more concentrated on a few major characters (e.g., Yuan Shikai, Cai E, Mao Zedong, Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao). But in general, the cast is good most of the time and at least the told historical facts are accurate (of course there're a lot of omitted trivia, e.g., Chen Duxiu went too often to night clubs and was sacked by the Peking university because he was found fighting for a prostitute). So if somebody is paying (e.g. the Chinese government) for the tickets, it's worthy to see it for free. But I won't pay to watch it, so a good strategy for the CCP would be to make it freely available online, after they've netted the 8 billion box office gross by the left-pocket, right-pocket trick."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"As quoted by a professor in China, ""It is an era of irony. You are encouraged to sing songs of revolution, but you are discouraged to make revolution. You are encouraged to see a film of founding a party (Beginning of the Great Revival), but you are discouraged to really found a new party."" Another quote from China netizen, ""It is a film about a group of people fighting dictatorship, and finally became the ones they originally fought against."" Facts are somewhat filtered and neglected from the film. If talking about May 4th movement, why the two main thoughts are omitted. The thoughts of democracy and science are main theme too. Why is this neglected? Why does the film selectively depict the May 4th movement with students just like Red Guard in Cultural Revolution - breaking into people home to catch and burning house. There are actually protest and strikes, and the protest started right from Tiananmen square. Why the most important scene is omitted? Why were open debate allowed in Beijing University's library at that time? What would happen if protest and open debate today? One of the two China communist party founding leaders is Chen Du-xiu. Ironically, he left the party later and refused any help from the communist party. He turned to liberalism instead."

建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Review: What an epic movie! This film certainly looked great and the costumes and scenery is superb but I didn't have a clue about what was going on. I didn't know who was who or what was where. The small captions on the bottom of the screen and the subtitles didn't help and the different story lines just made the whole movie hard to follow. Its a shame, because the acting is great and the I did feel a sense of intensity throughout the film but it's hard to keep up with the epic, political concept which changed China forever. The director over complicated the concept and he even added a love story, so there is way too many things going on at once. It reminded me a lot of the Founding Of The Republic, which was also extremely hard to follow and I personally gave up watching after a while. They could have easily split this film into 2 movies, so the director could have concentrated on different elements of he storyline. Anyway, although it looks great, the storyline is all over the place and I personally lost the plot. Disappointing!Round-Up: After watching a few Oriental movies, I did recognise a few faces throughout this movie but I still found it hard to follow. The movie was directed by Sanping Han who also directed the confusing Founding Of The Republic with Jianxin Huang. Sanping Han has produced some top movies like Shaolin, Confucius, the great Let The Bullets Fly, the Karate Kid and Mission Impossible 3, so he's certainly got experience when it comes to big movies but he really did over complicate this one. I have to commend the directors on there efforts and the scale of this film, especially in terms the huge cast and the amazing cinematography but from an entertainment perspective, there is just too much to concentrate on.I recommend this movie to people who are into their history/dramas starring Chow Yun- Fat, Angelababy, Daniel Wu, John Woo, Andy Lau, Simon Yam, Chao Deng, Xun Zhou and Kun Chen. 3/10"
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"LIU Ye's portrayal of young Mao is romanticised beyond belief, in scenes like the New Year Eve firework. It's generally known that Mao is just as much as womanizer as Jack and Bill, maybe with a little more kinship to Jack in their shared interest in movie stars, rather than to Bill's poor taste.The selling point of star-gazing is also stretched to the limit. The culminating climax of the movie, the meeting that establishes the Chinese Communist Party, is set in a aesthetically unsurpassed scene: on a boat drifting on an idyllic, serenely misty lake that might have been lifted directly out of the frame of a traditional Chinese painting. What you'll likely remember from this scene is not the rousing sentiments of the men inside the boat cabin, but of beautiful ZHOU Xun (who cares what character she plays) at the front, in elegant period dress holding a parasol, a bewitching goddess of love and loveliness.Just like ""The founding of a republic"" (2009), this movie is populated with a proliferation of Who's Who in ethnic Chinese movie world today, to the extent that to the general audience, their names may mean more than the names of the characters they play. The movie is not difficult to follow at least in the sense that events are presented in a linear and chronological manner, compared with the stock of temporally scrambled works we have become so used to. How much is recognized depend on how familiar one is what this part of Chinese history. But when the names (which appear on the screen at the characters' first appearance) are missed or not recognized, one probably surmises that in a movie of this sort, if they are played by the likes of Andy Lau or Daniel Wu, they must be good guys."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Very interesting to see history alive on the big screen. Very busy identifying the characters and the stars and associating them with what we have learnt in history class. As a movie, character development is weak because there are simply too many people parading in two hours distilled from a turbulent 10 years of contemporary China. As an education aid for Chinese history, this is very interesting, lively and educational, thanks to the on screen description. As a mirror to reflect recent China's development, my eyes moist to see history not only repeats itself but somehow even moves backwards. Same passion from the students, same type of demonstration against the weak and corrupted government. Same demand to open government doors. Even same style of kneeling down to appeal. Didn't we learn anything from history? The students in 1919 even hit some government officials and set fire on their houses. But the Nationalist government did not crash them to death or force them to leave the country. When some students started a hunger strike in jail and asked for newspapers to read as a deal, the prison guards gave in. Can't we see the film is trying to tell us a message about the present state through historic events? A party based on the strength of workers, farmers and soldiers and the have-not's have developed into a unique style with Chinese characteristics where those at the bottom of the pyramid are still suffering. The movie may seem boring or bland on the surface. We need to contrast that with reality. The message is safely disguised under the name of history. Where else in China can we see large scale demonstrations, deemed legitimate, in a Chinese movie? I look forward to seeing a movie on the Cultural Revolution and the June 4 incident with equal dedication."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Just like the movie that came in about few years ago, propagating the government, and how they had established the ""new China"", this is a documentary film, trying to deliver the history at that time. I see that many of the reviews said that there were not a storyline throughout the film, and can't see the connections between them. However, as a historical documentary, I consider the film without a storyline, but rather, a timeline. The timeline went from 1909 (I think) to before WW2. I in fact do not consider this movie boring, and believe that it has its positive sides. Unlike some other government productions, this movie is rather subjective, with not too much intentions to propagate the govenment. Again, it was meant to go over the whole history of the communist govenment in this period of time. But some recommendations about the film, if you aren't Chinese, don't watch the movie, if you hate the govenment, I mean, by hate, don't watch it, if you do not know anything and don't want to know about the historical figures of China, don't watch the movie. I didn't find the film extremely interesting, but it briefly helped me go over the history of China."

In China, the people are the masters of the country and the true masters of the country. In the case of COVID-19, we can see that foreign capitalists are demanding the resumption of production and work for the sake of interests, regardless of the lives and health of workers, while accusing China of not being good at fighting the epidemic. In China, the epidemic has been completely controlled, which is the real democracy! This is real freedom! Most of the critics didn't understand the real ideas behind the movie -- Marxism and communism. People in capitalist countries are just like a mob of people, under the spell of capitalists, who think they are very ""free"" to live under their invisible iron hoof. They do not know that they have been sold by capitalists long ago, but they are still busy helping the capitalists to count their money."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Great struggle! What an impressive movie with great casts. The actors and actresses have done well. The movie was filled with lots of suspense. Chow Yun Fatt and Andy Lau were superb. There were so many well known actors and actresses in this movie. All the casts have done well to illustrates the titanic struggle to unite the country. The peaceful protest,demonstrations and the nationalism portrayed were very realistic. I have watched it several times and some scenes reminded me of the OWS movement. The movie did awesomely in portraying how the conspiracy to divide China inspired the people to go against the corrupted officials. I highly recommended all to watch."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"I don't think this movie is intended for non-Chinese, who weren't taught that history (1910-1949) in China. Here is the logic. The Qing Dynasty, a symbol of Feudalism, had already resigned. The Beiyang government was good at selling nation's interest and shooting at students. Sun Yat-sen was too fragile to lead China. KMP was totally corrupted and lead the whole country into disaster. So only CCP could represent Chinese people's interest and lead China. (Don't raise your hands. Recite them and we'll have tests tomorrow.) Such series(foundation of party/government) are just a film version of history books."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"The way Chinese movies like this are themed are a focus on the thought and diplomacy behind great events. I think the West is too used to 90 minutes of jam packed action, guns and swords blazing. The depictions in this movie are accurate and moving. The May the 4th Movement protest gave me goosebumps as a Chinese student. The hardships and ambition of the founders of the CPC and the students of Beijing is shown very well too. Just a shame that afterwards (not in the movie but in real life) most the founders of the party would be killed or defect before 1949."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"I would first say that the movie is for Chinese audience, or for those who know Chinese and Chinese history. I don't mean to set a gap here, but if you don't know who's who, you may get lost. And then, when you finish the movie, you tend to draw a conclusion that everything is for the creation of the Communist Party of China. OK, you have no clue and thereby think it's all about politics. Indeed, the movie is not about a single story but a piece of history as long as 10 years. That may be why the non-Chinese audience quickly lose their interest and patience. That's true that the movie is dedicated to the party. However, for the Chinese audience who were educated to memorize the big names of historical figures, as well as the famous student protest (May Fourth Movement), it would be very interesting to see how the event is restored on screen. Everything happens for a reason. If you can discard your doubt about the political purpose of the movie during watching, you may get to know the history better and then think for a while how it is transited from the beginning to 90 years later. Besides, you would hardly understand the metaphor hidden in the ""seemingly dull"" plots if you don't know the contemporary Chinese society. I personally guess that the director learned a bit from the very popular Chinese movie Let the Bullet Fly (in theaters earlier this year). How? Think about the final words of the movie, which was read aloud on the boat ...For its content, the censorship organization may worry that it is kinda sensitive for the vivid description of student protest. But considering its purpose, it must be in theaters (what did the incredibly many movie stars come together for?) So, I think that's the ""novelty"" of this movie."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"Well, this is a movie made with political purpose, however it is not an extremely bad movie if you take off the political bits.the producer has been working hard on the detail and it actually corrected several historical common sense of the general Chinese population.Lot of famous local celebrities so it is quite fun sometimes.Apart from that it is nothing, this is not a serious way to produce a movie for history.BTW, the writer used to write comedy.I think a fair score will be 2 or 3, however because of this movie, transformer 3 will have to be postponed till end of July therefore i will give 1."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"I really loved this magnificent epic. As an avid reader of Chinese history, I was surprised by the historical accuracy of this film. Now I realize why the Chinese people love Mao-Zedong; most of the touching moments in the film involve his beloved Yang-Kaihui and him. As for the film being propagandistic, aren't most films made in Hollywood propagandistic? Delta Force, Rambo, Top Gun, just to mention a few. I guess some narrow-minded people might consider it propaganda if it shows the Chinese point of view instead of the Western perspective. I truly recommend this film to anybody who is interested in politics and Chinese history."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"With an ensemble of fine actors, this movie offers a nice historical background of China. This movie also made me understand why the majority of Chinese people during that time had probably some gratitude to the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, who - to a certain extent - succeeded to bring unity and political stability, which China needed badly during that time. However, I have my doubts if Mao Zedong was really such a humble and gentle soul, being 100% committed to fidelity and monogamy as depicted in the movie. However, if the Chinese Communist Party insists on depicting Mao Zedong as a saint, I am prepared to swallow that, and whatever other divine virtues the Chinese Communist Party wants to attribute to Mao Zedong. The movie also emphasizes how important the student movement was for the CCP, and how important students are in general for the development of China - which is blatantly inconsistent with today's policy of the CCP; the Chinese Communist Party having succeeded to virtually ban the topic of student movement in today's China. I can understand that the 89' Tiananmen Square Massacre complicates this topic - especially as hardliners of the Chinese Communist Party are primarily to blame for this atrocity against Chinese students - but all the more reason that this needs to be addressed and resolved in China; including an apology by the Chinese Communist Party, which is still lacking."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"This movie was shot in China, still firmly controlled by Chinese Communist Party. Of course it will contain the story told by CCP. Undoubtedly it contains endless speeches to show how necessary and great CCP was. So please forget about that part. If you see the movie to look for art, drama, affection, of course you will be disappointed.But what makes this movie different from the other Chinese propaganda movies is its huge cast. There are tons of famous Chinese, including Hong Kong and oversea Chinese, actors and actresses. You can never see so many stars in one movie, other than Jian Guo Da Ye, also produced by the same producer with an equally huge cast two years ago. The fun of watching this movie is to ""count stars"", instead of follow its boring and revisioned story."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"The BAD. A prequel to Founding Of A Republic, and merely an another attempt at glorifying The Communist Chinese Party for its part in bring China under one banner.Personally this film would be a peace of garbage if it wasn't for the Chinese Super Stars that starred in this film.The GOOD I enjoy the action sequence when the First Civil War erupted during the warlord era. But right after that the film was more Politically Motivated at making the CCP,(Chinese Communist Party), look good and bashing others. Jackie Chan's 1911 was more easily enjoyable then this Communist Propaganda film. As soon as I see a name of one of China's worst leaders,(Man responsible for the failed Great Leap Forward), I just knew it was gonna go down hill really bad. In the End the film was good for battle scenes and for it's nostalgic imperial clothing and 1911 post clothing that people wore back then. Other than that, this film was a Communist film all the way.In 1900's and 1911 and on wards China was a country that had a revolution movement that was a ticking time bomb just waiting to be lit and explode. The Chinese Civil War ended with one victor. The Communist won. And China is the way that is today."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"It seems that this movie has a low score due to being propaganda for the Communist Party of China. I choose however to judge the film as a film, not as a piece of propaganda. The story, if you can even call it a story, is very disconnected, more like a series of events than an actual narrative. Almost all of the events, especially those early on, seem to be concerned with a bunch of Chinese men in thin mustaches speaking about different matters. At the start of each such episode, there i a brief text with a date and a short explanation. Since my Chinese is not good enough to read this, it is all a rather confusing mishmash of things happening. Since my knowledge of modern Cinese history is also somewhat limited I cant say if anything is historically accurate or just made up. What I do know is that an effort has been put into portraying a time of great conflict and political turmoil, and portraying a sort of general movement in the otherwise nonexistent story. I believe, that a person who understands Chinese would understand more of whats going on, I however found it rather tedious and boring at times.There are scenes in the movie where the men in mustaches stop talking and start doing things instead, for instance there i a battle sequence (I have no idea who is fighting who) which is really good, all actions scenes manage to wake you up and capture the viewers imagination for a moment. Visually the movie is very nice, everything looks good, especially previously mentioned war scene. The music is fitting too and it all creates a lot of atmosphere, with such a fragmented plot, it almost becomes a case of style over substance, though i can sense that the substances is in there somewhere. I think in the end tat, as a movie, ""The Founding of a Party"" is not bad at all. It has its boring moments and the disjoint storyline is a big problem but other than that, I think it kind of works, I would rate this at six out of ten but then there is that propaganda issue.The film ends with an episode in 1921 (which I remember to be more or less historically correct from what little history i know) and then it fast forwards through World War II up to the modern day. This is all accompanied by a narrator (who wasn't translated in my version of the film) who seems to be telling about how china rose to power and everything was good. This whole ending really ruins it for me, especially the final shot of modern day Beijing with a portrait of Chairman Mao outside the forbidden city. The entire film is very one sided, buts that's just a matter of perspective, it is clear though, that this final part of the film is pure propaganda and I jut cant stand by that. Because of the propaganda part I have to lower my grade by two points."
建党伟业,Beginning of the Great Revival (2011),,2011,2011.06.24,"On the plane, I looked back at this movie ten years ago. At that time, I went to the cinema just to count the stars. Now I see it again and find that it is really difficult to shoot. It is called ""the great cause of the founding of the party"", but ambition is to comb through the recordable modern history from the beginning, which is inevitable. However, it is not easy to balance commerciality and dedication. Although the theme of the whole film is unknown and no effective characters have been established, it is indeed the best work to balance the two characteristics mentioned above. In 1921, although the perspective is more concentrated and more ""people-friendly"", it has lost the opening and closing under the background of the great era and become more ""small family spirit"". When it comes to 110 years, we might as well follow the idea of the great cause of the founding of the party and make another concentrated attempt, which may have good results."
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Seriously, who can possibly resist the temptation of the flawless and seductive display from the ever-wonderful Zhou Xun, a much improved performance from Zhao Wei (after her dismal role in last year's ""Mulan"") and of course the insanely cute portrayal by Mini Yang. Like the 2008 prequel, ""Painted Skin"", to truly embrace the experience, the audience needs to slip into the film like a dream and suspend all beliefs. The more you escape from reality and believe into the world of ""Painted Skin: The Resurrection"", the more you will end up enjoying the experience. It is one of those special films that require the audience to just go with the flow, enjoy the scenery, the on-screen beauties on display, over the top action sequences, some truly wonderful acting and along with the stunning bright visuals on display.Zhou Xun is simply flawless in her display as the ""spirit"" that wants to be more human than human. However, while this film shares the same issue as Ridley Scott's classic ""Bladerunner"", the issue of wanting to be more human is only given a superficial flick of a dice. Still, Zhou is able to carry the film and the manner in which she seductively graces the screen is nothing short of amazing. In particular her noticeable dance to seduce the General (played by Chen Kun) is certainly a highlight. It should also be noted that when the Zhou is required to switch roles with Zhao Wei, it is Zhou who is able to seamlessly step into the shoes of the princess character. It's been a while since Zhou's winning performance in ""Perhaps Love"", and while she may not win this year, another nomination is only just around the corner.In terms of Zhao Wei, one must say that she gets better with age. This does not mean that she is aging well in terms of beauty, but rather the improvement comes in the form of her acting. After the disappointing ""Mulan"" where the fault lies more in the director and the script, rather than her ability in question, Zhao stands shoulder to shoulder in the role of a princess who values beauty and exterior, over the need of being a human. Her character is a direct contrast to Zhou Xun and she performs particularly well until the two switches bodies. There is a sadness in her eyes that allows the audience to always sympathize with her. It is a natural ability that cannot be taught and in many ways, she was always like this. Think back to ""Shaolin Soccer"" days, the tears in her eyes when she made the noodles still stands firmly on the back of my mind. While she did not exceed Zhou in terms of acting, there is no doubt that Zhao is finally coming of age.After first catching my eye in ""All's Well, Ends Well 2012"" as the swimsuit babe, tackling a relatively difficult and engaging role in ""Love in the Buff"" and then meeting her in person at the same movie premiere, it is unreservedly that Mini Yang is the latest ""it"" girl to win my heart. What impressed me in this role is how versatile Yang is. Yang is constantly cute and perhaps the one character in the film that can link more to reality at a human level. Her giggles, laughs, cute-eyed look and comic timing is all at show here. While on surface, it seems like an easy role to play, it should not be underestimated, as it is a kind of role that can so easily go the route of being outright annoying and a waste of space. Instead Yang is able to glue the audience to the screen and turn her small role into a scene stealing performance. Putting aside my personal bias, Yang is still an actress to watch for years to come.It must be said that one cannot stop being disappointed in the lack of a need for 3D or perhaps for the film not making most of the technology on hand. While ""Painted Skin: The Resurrection"" is beautiful to look at and at times the bright contrast and use of colours in the scenery and backdrop is breathtaking to endure. On the other hand, in the battle scene where the shooting of thousands of arrows is disappointing to say the least, despite obviously taking a page out of Zhang Yimou's infamous ""Hero"" scene. While Yimou did not have the same technology back in 2002, ""Skin"" fails to stretch the 3D technology and the result lacks the outcome of Yimou's earlier work. The film always lacks the vital ingredient of fight sequences, this may be due to the departure of Donnie Yen, but for the few fights that is included, almost all of them are well-choreographed. However, sometimes, less is not more, when the film could have done with at least a few more elaborated staged fights.All in all, ""Painted Skin: The Resurrection"" is easily a crowd pleaser and in many ways more of the same as the 2008's original. What I really enjoy about these kinds of fantasy films are the manner in which it allows you to escape into another world. Imagine having a dream which compose of the seductiveness of Zhou Xun, the sympathetic looks of Zhao Wei and the cute-eyed Mini Yang. For me, it is more like a dream come true. Still, ""Skin"" is by no means a perfect movie and as with most dreams there are numerous plot holes, flaws and unrealistic moments, but if one is able to totally suspend your beliefs, then one can truly enjoy the experience. At the end of the day, sometimes when watching a film like ""Painted Skin: The Resurrection"" it is all about entertainment and for me, just thinking of the trio of actresses, I am already finding it hard to resist. Most certainly a dream-like experience (Neo, 2012) Neo rates it 8/10 www. thehkneo.com/blog"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Gordon Chan's Painted Skin back in 2008 had Singapore's Raintree Pictures as a production partner, with China born actor Qi Yuwu in one of his many overseas film forays, but the follow up film is a purely all-China affair, showing off what the Chinese film companies can do in terms of storytelling and effects, In all honesty, I prefer Painted Skin II over its predecessor precisely because it took its time to tell a proper story, contrary to the treatment of many mainstream China made films in the similar genre that had overemphasized less than stellar CG effects and sacrificed story along the way.This is not a sequel, nor is it a prequel to the 2008 film, despite having to share the same title both in English and Mandarin. Most of the primary cast returned, and played totally new characters, where you can speak of this as if it's a spiritual companion to the first film, challenging the same cast in having to portray different characters in what would structurally almost be the same film, except with new themes and characters thrown into the mix, complete with breathtaking landscapes that only Western China could offer.In this story, the power trio of Zhou Xun, Vicky Zhao and Chen Kun return. Zhou Xun reprises the role where she's the temptress foxy spirit Xiao Wei and the primary antagonist of sorts in this story, ripping out the hearts of man to devour and maintain her mortal looks. Being cursed and needing to fend off her icy prison, she got rescued by Zhao Wei's Princess, a royalty with an incredibly strong heart and a partially masked face, pining for the love of Chen Kun's General, who's at the frontiers to ward off the kingdom's enemies, which also serves as a refuge to hide his true feelings for the woman he believes he cannot deserve after being indirectly responsible for the mishap which led to her disfigurement.Most of the screen time and plot development went to these three, and the camera just gorgeously captures them all in their romantic dalliances, especially when Xiao Wei becomes the de facto spanner in both the Princess and the General's love life no thanks to a little mesmerizing black magic that's cast to help Xiao Wei in her cause to obtain the Princess' heart, and become human. Sure it's a merry-go-round manner, but we learn certain rules of the game, where a transformation can only take place should a heart be willingly given up, as opposed to forcefully obtained by the demon. And in fact this issue is central and broached more than once in the film.It revolves around the themes of unrequited love, sacrifice, and the long held belief that we are attracted to beautiful, flawless things, even if it's something a superficial as a woman's looks. The characters go back and forth in dealing with their emotions, and thankfully this served as sufficient back story to their individual characters, allowing a multi-faceted dimension to them, which of course worked wonders for its running time of over two hours. This in addition to the wonderful deliberate visuals that director Wuershan had given this film that the first one didn't possess.Zhou Xun plays it cool this time round as the scheming Xiao Wei who would discover that being human isn't all that easy given that she has had powers easily taken for granted. Zhao Wei continues in her roles as warrior princesses from Red Cliff and Mulan, and plays to perfection the role of a woman willing to give up anything to be with the man she truly likes. And with two strong female leads playing opposite him, Chen Kun could well be regarded as the current Mr Popular with real acting ability, given license to brood most of the time as the conflicted General who isn't too aware that his eyes were stamped and cursed, leading him away from, and providing him reason enough to stray. The performances of these three together can go on forever.Granted though with the increase in time dedicated for a special effects showcase, and an unwavering focus on characters, what had to give was the martial arts and fight scenes, which pale in scenes if compared to the first film. The martial arts practitioners were clearly reduced, and the antagonists in the form of the Wolf clan's Shaman (Kris Philips) and Queen (Chen Tingjia) didn't quite provide any real threat save for their sheer numbers of faceless army goons they bring to the fray. Their objective though brings the story full circle, with Mini Yang and Feng Shao-Feng's characters as Xiao Wei's bird companion, and a bumbling demon-slayer respectively, were in just to add to star power and for minor comic relief, being in tangent sub-plots that serve little to the main story.Still, Painted Skin: The Resurrection actually revived some hopes that the Chinese film industry is capable of coming up with visually attractive, action-adventures that tap on the Liao Zhai sources, if elements in the film were well balanced with an adequate story, backed by solid cast members. And having some really sensual scenes in the film didn't hurt it at all given enough of them to highlight the man-demon transformation which was almost extreme Face-Off like, but in a sexier fashion. Recommended!"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Life has been good but at times it gets to be mundane, and boring. So I need to escape from reality and get lost in another world. Many films, such as 'Pan's Labyrinth' and 'Kwaidan', offer me a channel to another world for a couple of hours. 'Painted Skin II' does an equally good job in this regard with its dose of fox demons (the good kind), a princess and warriors.I watched the film on a BluRay disc. The colour, the imagery, the landscape, the costumes, the feminine sexuality - all visually stunning and often poetic. There are also two love stories in there too, and these are no conventional love stories - they are the very complicated kind. The action sequences, often done in slow-mo, are satisfying. Acting is great, especially by the two leading ladies. This film offers all I need from a fantasy story.It appears that not many in the North America are aware of this film or have seen it. That is indeed a pity. I hope director Wuershan will move on to do Painted Skin III. Something I very much would look forward to."
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But it surprised me. The story (already well documented on this site) was not overly complex yet it did have some deeper themes about sacrifice, being enraptured by physical beauty and yet being hollow inside. The hardest thing for me was that Princess Ying (Vicky Zhao) was supposed to be depressed about her facial scars - hidden by her golden mask. But I find her to be extremely attractive so to imagine her as some horrible ugly thing was hard to swallow. Even when she reveals her mask the scars don't look all that bad. Actually all three main actresses were very attractive and did very well in their respective roles. The only minor complaint would be the wooden performance by the actor portraying the general. He livens up towards the end so I guess I'll give him a pass.8/10"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"I have just watched Painted Skin 2 - The Resurrection yesterday. What a movie! I don't usually write reviews for movies (to much time-consuming), but to this movie I feel the urge to do that, because it is totally worth it.Firstly, I would like to stress the fact that this kind of fantasy movie is not just for anyone. Being in a country closely related to China in terms of culture, custom, and even language, I feel sorry for viewers from Western countries as well as many others as it's impossible for them to understand the story well. The concept of demons under the skin of a beauty, seducing men for their hearts is not new, in fact, it's a fantasy tale that has been spread among Asia for thousands of years. Hence, the movie itself leaves a very mysterious and beautifully thrilling impression to people who are familiar to the tale.Opening the movie is the scene of the fox demon being imprisoned under the deadly cold ice. Such was the demon's beauty that a demon bird was attracted, freeing her from the ice. Then her journey of devouring human's hearts began, with the aim of finding a human who would voluntarily offer his heart so that she can become a true human, which leads her to the fateful meeting with the strong on-the-outside-yet-weak-on-the-inside, disfigured Jing princess and her love interest - the damaged hero Huo Xin.The CGI scenes, which might look badly done and painfully fake to a lot of people, is one of the important factors attracting me. Just let yourself be, forget the reality and get into that fantasy mysterious world. The characters are typical of what people look like at that time - long-haired tough soldiers, beauty with big attractive eyes, fair skin and hair so long that it can touch the floor, flying all over the places beautifully when the wind comes. The movie is totally a feast to the eyes. Stunning visual everywhere, from the landscape to the people.And the most important thing that contribute to the success of the movie: the actors. Zhou Xun (the demon) is simply flawless. Whether it's her look, or her acting, it's simply perfect. Her role is definitely the highlight of the movie. Whatever she does, no one can hate her. I can feel the pain in her eyes, the sadness hiding behind the mask of a evil demon. That is what I call a true actress. But that doesn't mean Zhao Wei (the princess) did a bad job. She played her role very well. There's no room for complaint. The reason why I love Zhou Xun so much is probably because her character of the demon in the movie is kind of more complicated and interesting to me. Comparing with those 2 actresses, Chen Kun falls a little bit flat. His role is very well played, it's just ... flat. However to combine all the 3 we made a powerful trio, making the mission to conquer all the box offices in China possible.The plot, although I have to say doesn't have much originality, is still interesting enough to keep my eyes on the screen. The movie is a heart-breaking love story, dealing with the issue of true beauty.Although we all claim that the true beauty is what people possess inside, isn't it true that everybody is attracted to a beautiful face in some way?"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"I came across this flick because it was sold new on 3D for only 5 Euro's and not having any problems with Asian flicks and liking the story I was eager to watch it. I'm glad I did because I liked it.I knew from before that this was going to be a pure Chinese flick, in which I mean acting, story and score. That said that means that a lot of fantasy geeks will leave this for what it is because they can't catch up with the Chinese/Asian feeling.The CGI used was also a problem for many but again I didn't had any trouble with it. I agree that some CGI really looked cheap but it fits perfectly in this slow moving love story. But the fight scene's make it watchable and the erotic feeling between the princess and the demon in the bath also makes it watchable. There's no nudity to spot but the scene does give it an lesbian, erotic touch. Not only that, the acting also is sublime what makes this more watchable. But at the end, if you can't understand Asian horror or fantasy then leave this for what it is but if you are open minded for some melodrama then this is your stuff, no go eat those azaleas...Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"This movie had me teetering on wanting to say it was excellent in the vein of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon/Hero or feeling like it wasn't quite up to par. Visually many of the scene were art in motion (a la Hero), but then they have shoddy computer animation (the bear that attacks the Princess and the bird played by Mini Yang). As for a love story it is one of those long suffering epics that sort of grabs and tears your heart. The Princess has a lifetime never ending love for the Warrior and would do anything for him, even ""sell her soul to the devil"". The Warrior, because of his honorable service to her denies his own love for her. When demons get involved everything is twisted and complicated. My buddy & I gave it a ""thumbs up"" after watching it."
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"This sequel was totally unnecessary. Why? Because it was essentially just a remake of the 2008 movie ""Painted Skin"", which also was better than this sequel. It felt like they tried to show part one as it should have been if they had the budget similar to the sequel.The story in part two was just too similar to part one, to the point where it became a shameless knock off of the 2008 movie. And that just added to the pointless feeling of it the movie.Xun Zhou and Wei Zhao carried the movie quite nicely, as they also did in the first movie, and they were joined by a talented cast ensemble.Visually this was an impressive and beautiful movie. The CGI and special effects team delivered an amazing experience here. And the costumes and locations also were right on the money, being impressive and beautiful as well.This was not the brightest of moments in Chinese cinema. Don't get me wrong though, because it is a good movie in itself. Just too bad that it was such a shameless rip off of part one. If you haven't seen part one then the sequel is a good movie. If you have seen part one, don't really bother much with part two."

He blames himself for this; Jing had a golden mask made to cover it.Delineation of conflicts: Xiawei comes to like Jing and Xin. She sees a process to become mortal, but it involves bringing harm to Jing and Xin. Jing would like her own beauty restored, but the cost might be steep indeed. The Tian Lang state would like to make inroads in Jing's kingdom; Jing and company would rather that not happen. Tian Lang's true motives are darker.Resolution: One might guess how the film's climax comes to pass, but difficult choices are involved. Are the principal characters up to it?"

What excellent story telling. It was beautiful. The tears shed throughout, had me stringing along emotionally. I have never seen anything so beautiful. I was ready to give my heart willingly to almost all the characters in this movie. Well done! Beautiful cast! Beautiful people! I can't wait to see what's next. I'm afraid that I won't see something as wonderful as this film for a very long time. But I shall await patiently. I saw this on netflix. Tonight I get to share it with my family. I know they will all agree that this is a wonderful film."

The plot is almost identical, same actor and actress casted in a very similar love relationship and the demon tried to mingle in between them, ultimately making the sacrifice (though the ending is different from the first). There is however literally nothing new to see here except with the addition of extra CGI and more cost heavy battle scenes, which at parts were totally unnecessary and did not add much to the overall depth of the plot.You can get a decent kick out of them if you watch it now and then. But nothing ground breaking."
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Painted Skin: The Resurrection plot is better left not summarize into a simple a sentence.It's an experience that requires the audience to suspend all disbelief in order to enjoy it. It contains an interesting lore on demons, a captivating love story involving demons, and enough set pieces to ravel any major blockbuster. What makes this romance story interesting as it unfold is how it shot. Breathtaking photography is always on screen making one visually mesmerizing experience. The attention to detail on the sets as well the costumes are worth noting. It helped me become immerse in the movie in such way I was taken out of my reality. The special effects are well done and it's nice to see CG not used as a mean for explosions or giant robots. The acting is spotless from all of it actors. I particularly enjoyed Xun Zhou who manages to be seductive as a demon without resorting to nudity. I do have a minor complain about some of the actors being underused. My favorite being the very funny Ming Yang who didn't have a major role in the movie, but that's just a small complaint. The great production values and effort put into this film far outweighs any negatives one would have with this fantasy film. Painted Skin: The Resurrection is an interesting as a romance story can get in the fantasy genre. It offers beautiful visuals to go along with an great plot that will have anyone hook on it."

画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Zhou Xun returns as the illustriously desirable fox spirit Xiao Wei in Painted Skin The Resurrection. 500 years have passed since the conclusion of the original feature, and for the entirety of that time, Xaio Wei has been condemned to an icy grave, for saving the life of the man she loved, and that of his paramour. According to demon lore, there can be no greater heresy. Que'er (Mi Yang), a cute bird demon, finds herself captivated by Xiao Wei's beauty, and releases her from the prison, remaining by her side as a loyal and faithful accomplice.This freedom though is only temporary, for wherever Xiao Wei goes, the frozen grave accompanies her, ready to swallow her whole once more. By sheer coincidence, both demons happen upon Princess Jing (Zhao Wei), who has fled the palace in order to escape the marriage that has been arranged between her and the Tianlang prince, a man she can never love.Wearing a golden mask across half her face, which was once disfigured during an attack, Princess Jing intends to ride for the White City, in order to meet General Huo Xin (Chen Kun), the man who once protected her. Unable to escape her feelings for him, she wishes to discover if the romantic connection is mutually shared. Princess Jing's heart, although belonging to the General, becomes Xiao Wei's prize, its power been able to stopper the icy prison from ever containing her again.With an approaching eclipse, it is during this time that demons can swap bodies with humans, but only if a heart is offered willingly, and Xiao Wei, who desperately wishes to become human, will do almost anything to win it. But is she really as cold as the prison pursuing her, or has she herself softened? The prison however is not the only threat, for a demon hunter, Pang Lang (Feng Shaofeng) is present in the city, and though incompetent, he is certainly no fool to the magic that she wields.Visually, Painted Skin The Resurrection is perfect. The costumes are gorgeously decorated, while the effects are reminiscent of a dream sequence, as are the fights, which are epically choreographed. You can't help but gasp in awe at many of the scenes, which serenade the eyes with their outstanding execution.Occasionally however, the sheer potency, not to mention the frequency of the effects, feel unnecessary in contrast with the original, and though live action and computer generated scenes are bound together over the duration of the film, sometimes the story could have been conveyed just as passionately, without the continuous use of these features.Moreover, the accompanying musical score continuously sets the mood, regardless of whether it is a sweeping romantic melody played beside a scene of desirous passion, or brazen percussion during a fight sequence. The acting is superb, and provides a deep emotional connection between both characters and the viewer, the emotion, whether it be pain or happiness, been flawlessly presented, while the script, much like the original, is beautifully poetic.Over the course of the feature, a potential complaint could be that the movie runs for too long. Perhaps, but by the time the beautiful conclusion makes its way across the screen, you will more than likely be glad that you took the time to watch this magnificent gem. Neither better nor worse than the original, Painted Skin The Resurrection is as equally magnificent as the first, and fabulously concludes, what has to be, two of the best films made this century."

A total new assembly of actors/actresses join them this time around and, create yet another incredible supernatural, non horror/scary romantic love story. The acting is top notch...the action is top notch and the - small amount used - of CGI was top notch!Its a film that boyfriends can watch with their girlfriends, as can husbands and wives, because it has something for all. You are completely unaware of the passing 2 hours film length and, it has an ending that will have you hoping with all your heart :) You will have to see/watch it to experience that part though!"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"Though I come here to read reviews quite often, I have never bothered with a review until this particular movie. We stumbled across this movie and decided to watch it on a whim. I had never heard of it before yesterday, nor its predecessor, and I normally shy away from Chinese fantasy that isn't big box office, yet there was something in the synopsis that caught my attention. Figuring we could always switch it off if it proved truly awful, we decided to take a chance. I'm quite happy we did.First the bad side. The choreography for the fight scenes doesn't make sense half the time in the beginning (a man flipping and twirling off his horse because he was sliced by a sword? What?), and the graphics are definitely low budget (the green-screen scene by the lake toward the middle of the movie was just wretched). The plot gets so over dramatic at times that it takes away from the story itself (the eye thing toward the end was just too much x.x), though upon reflection it does make more sense than most fantasy movies these days (yes George, even one arrow in the shoulder can freaking HURT, thank you). The make-up could have been a bit better, and I was honestly expecting to see more vulpine qualities in the demon, if you know what I mean.Redemption time: I feel this movie is such wonderful proof that there are times when the acting and the plot can make up for a whole world of sin. Even when some of the short-comings were a distraction, it was still easy to get drawn right back into the story. The choreography for the fighting definitely improves (the scarred princess has amazing moments for this o.o), and the choreography for the dancing is exquisite. The acting between the demon fox and scarred princess is stunning at times, especially toward the most crucial parts where most actors tend to drop the ball (not going to give away spoilers here. You'll see what I mean when you get there). The singing of the demon fox is haunting and beautiful, and the demon bird is so much what this movie needed. I also didn't even think about it until toward the end just how much subtle symbolism there is.Down two stars because of how much the movie lacked, but if you can get your hands on it and forgive its short-comings, this movie is definitely worth the watch. Now to find the first one!"
画皮2,Painted Skin: The Resurrection (2012),,2012,2012.08.18,"I could not pretend to summarize or understand it's many meanings. The story is consistent but tricky to follow imho. The topic of demons is quite strong and interwoven throughout the plot. If you liked Total Recall you could suspend your rational mind enough to enjoy the acting, story, visuals. It's not heavy on the fighting and it's a spectacle all on it's own. The story starts immediately so pay attention right from the start. I didn't care for the logo double treatment deal. There's a high number of these creative kung fu action films that go beyond Hollywood is so many ways. It's inspiring but I'm guessing not many people see them. I watch them because they are so different yet amazing."
私人订制,Personal Tailor (2013),,2013,2013.12.19,"It is a phenomenon how Feng Xiaogang has established himself as the voice of the people in terms of Mainland Chinese cinema. Nobody else that makes films as didactic and on-the-nose as he does and still be so loved and supported. His latest comedy Personal Tailor is a series of vignettes about its four employees taking on different clients and making their dreams come true. The clients include a chauffeur who wants to be an important authority figure, a schlock B- movie director who wants to learn the essence of good taste and a working class cleaning lady who gets to be rich for one day. The vignettes vary from farce, satire, the absurd and even sometimes the fantastical. Reality is out of the window but it is the fable-like quality that holds the piece together.Longtime Feng Xiaogang leading man Ge You plays his classic comedy archetype, the swindler with the heart of gold. That character will never get old. Bai Baihe from last year's hit Love is Not Blind and Li Xiao Lu from Xiu Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl are both charming and funny. Jackie Chan and Huang Bao Qiang also make small cameos to ease the investors, however neither should be a reason to see the film.The star of the film is Feng Xiaogang himself, who in each vignette gives us his thoughts and commentary on topics like social class, materialism, rich vs. poor and reality vs. dreams. It is fun watching the four leads run around in costumes and trying to drive their client's ambitions down so their business turns out a profit, but their characterizations are not developed. They are merely puppets to a Feng Xiaogang puppet show and only exist to deliver the director's multiple messages. The heavy messaging has long been a trope of Feng's films and it must be said that Personal Tailor is the most thinly veiled of all his works. If you haven't seen any of Feng Xiaogang's urban comedies, Personal Tailor may not be the place to start.Lastly, the movie is too long. The segment where the team ventures out in the wild to apologize for man's appalling crimes against nature is too far fetched and 'tree huggy' for my taste. Personal Tailor is by no means Feng Xiaogang's best work and it probably wouldn't have a very long shelf life after its Lunar Year theatrical release. For English speaking audiences, the film actually has good subtitles but its humor probably will be lost in translation. Even for Feng Xiaogang fans, this isn't a movie to own in your Blu-ray collection. To them I say, go see it in theaters while it's current and get your laughs from the latest Feng Xiaogang social commentary. It is a sincere hopeful message, but for me, it's still too didactic."
私人订制,Personal Tailor (2013),,2013,2013.12.19,"It is admirable for the production to tackle head on how government officials surrender to the temptation of monetary bribes and seductive women as corruption offerings. It also exposes the loss of taste in view of popular culture and the extravagant lifestyle of those suddenly get rich. The film also addresses the consequence of pollution amid various rapid economic development in China.I always enjoy Feng's movies which has a sharp observation on social phenomenon in China. But this one lacks a tight and coherent script or a good plot despite its good intention.The film centers on a company that has a mission to help clients realize their dreams – to officiate the ultimate fake – even though it may mean gross the staff out. That is precisely what many Chinese up-and-coming entrepreneurs are doing – as long as it generates cash, zero principles or bottom line whatsoever matters. Hence we see different projects the company works on to serve their clients.It is quite creative to crystallize the twisted values in contemporary China while presenting it cynically. While the company is fictional, the troubles and frustrations the clients suffer from are real problems and doubts we have in rapidly changing China. The principal actors playing the roles of the four company staff members probably enjoy this production tremendously because they have the opportunity to play different roles in fulfilling their clients' dreams. But character development for each staff members is weak – they can be anyone playing those roles for a brief period. Hence, there is minimal identification with any characters in the movie, the clients included.However, the phenomenon is real and the incidents are probably based on real hearsay: that a hardworking government official will be tempted to abuse his power in approving public projects in exchange for handsome cash gifts and women. In another episode, an award-winning movie director is looking for elegance and taste but could not find it in China and eventually has to use extreme means  As for a one day rags- to-rich story, a cleaning lady is turned into a millionaire and lives an extravagant life for one day.Stunning cinematography towards the end in showing how grandiose the Chinese landscape could have been by exemplifying how they are now. But the way in presenting the apology to nature is too odd, tactless and artless. There is little link between the company business and this action.Despite all these, it is still quite entertaining and offers an interesting glimpse of modern China."
私人订制,Personal Tailor (2013),,2013,2013.12.19,"The only scene that touched me in the whole movie was the back of Song Dandan walking towards the contract, the only one. The plot is really ordinary, but the big shot's performance is OK. The more beautiful the film is, the more gimmicks and the less connotations it has."
私人订制,Personal Tailor (2013),,2013,2013.12.19,"The movie starts with a woman wanting to be interrogated by the Nazis. Yup, the Nazis. The Personal Tailor employees grow annoyed with her demands and create a jailbreak to end her fantasy ahead of schedule. The client figures out what they're doing suddenly wants to help her ""escape"". The best part of this movie is the ensemble playing the Personal Tailor staff. Their reactions to each fantasy assignment and client is great to watch. I give this an 8 due to the Personal Tailor Staff pulling off all the required fantasies while keeping their sanity. A cameo by Jackie Chan is a major bonus."
私人订制,Personal Tailor (2013),,2013,2013.12.19,"Personally, I like to the films of this director in the past. Most of them were very good comedies (in Chinese sense of humor).Back in 1997, there was a movie named 'The Dream Factory' by Xiaogang Feng(the same director) and You Ge(the same main actor) demonstrate this dream creating idea to public audience. That movie was a very good comedy. So this is just like a remake of that one after 17 years. Now surprises to me. If you could survive the first 10 mins of the movie, you could take the rest of it. I don't get the point of the first short story. I feel like it ruins the whole movie. All of the three stories are based on modern Chinese social issues. They are not new to people and there are too much public education in them. A good story makes the point very clear and it's redundant to say it out loud. As well as the last part of apology. My favorite part is the last last interview. It is very short, but you can see the big point of people in it."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"If you grew up watching Pretty in Pink (1986) and all those brat pack era college movies, it's likely a sign of being over-saturated with the by-products of Western acculturation. Truth be told, it's not often that we think of what high school life must be like, for the Chinese, and this film shows their many travails and hopes in the springtime of youth.In the vein of these coming-of-age college dramas, and portraying the excitements and tribulations of teenage romance in a much better way than the faux-hit that was the Taiwanese Cape No. 7 (2008), Zhao Wei makes her directorial debut with So Young.More commonly known as the titular feisty, spunky princess of the popular Huan Zhu Ge Ge series, Zhao Wei has her character imprinted deep in this film. Originally approached by Xin Yiwu,the author ofTo Our Youth that is Fading Awayto play the lead role, Zhao Wei eventually turned down the acting role to direct the movie.The first 30 minutes of So Young is a hilarious joyride as the camera moves through the seedy, hormone-charged hysteria of the Chinese college hallways. As the audience are given a taste of college dorm life in China through numerous campus shenanigans, we are introduced to the different characters, their relationships and dynamics. It's often the interesting and varied people we meet at school that stay on in our memories, and the fresh cast, made up of many first-time actors, brings tons of character into their different roles. The hot- tempered, boyish Xiao Bei (Liu Yase), demure Ruan Guan (Jiang Shuying), and bookish Chen Xiaozheng (Mark Chao) are but a few who make up the colorful cast. The film scores high in this aspect, evident from the heaps of delight and reactions from an ostensibly amused audience.Yang Zishan, the actress who plays the lead character Zheng Wei, that uncannily sounds like ""Zhao Wei,"" is the star of the movie with her thoroughly loveablespirited, cheeky, girl-next-door demeanour. Her loud, curt airs are uniquely paired with a vulnerable naïveté that steals the show in a moving climax of the film. Partly-inspired by her experiences living in a Chinese college dorm, Zhao Wei portrays these spaces in the film as hothouses for academic excellence, but also the fertile, experimental grounds for teenage angst, passion and innocence. For the parts which could have potentially tipped into the realm of ""cheesy,"" Zhao ingenuously turns them into slapstick laughs. She proves to be quite the savvy producer as well, adding in interesting bits such as the cameo of a popular mainland singer as a radio DJ with a late-night Aunt Agony talkshow, and a side story with a very cathartic payback scene involving Xiao Bei.Many years later, with the shift into adulthood, most of the characters will lose the spunk of their youth. When once they wore their hearts on their sleeves, they have now matured, or rather, become jaded with the harsh realities of life and having to be responsible for themselves and others. Poignantly, one of the film's deeper themes revolve around this resignation, and the bitter realisation of what it means to live ""successful"" lives and the sacrifices it takes to achieve this lie. It is here that the warm, dreamy hues of young adolescence fade into a cold, sombre grey that characterises a subdued adulthood. It is a stark transition, manifest in the mise-en-scène, and critiqued by many for causing a sudden sag in pacing. Yet, this is where I think the film truly excels, in not only being able to spin the audience wild with its characters' carefree insouciance early on, but to also portray the heart-wrenching life-changing moments that they experience growing up.To add to the free-spirited, whimsical tone of the film, ice queen Faye Wong lends her vocals to the theme song of the film, ""To Youth.""But be warned, however, watching So Young will have you strongly yearning for your youth."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"Zhao Wei's directorial debut, and all I can say is, this was definitely made for a niche audience. To get the true feeling of nostalgia that this film portrays, you have to be a 70s or early 80s baby who grew up in China. That being said, a lot of IMDb-ers are not Chinese, considering this website was blocked from Chinese internet until very recently.Personally, I thought this movie was good. I am Chinese-American and grew up in California, born in the late 80s, and with that background, I can feel empathetic towards many of the situations in this movie. However, I still feel like an outsider, and the feelings of nostalgia become lost on me, because frankly I've never been through the stuff the movie characters have. I went through the American education system. College consisted of drinking, smoking weed, frat parties, raves, and the occasional library session. Chinese universities are just so vastly different, you can probably imagine what it must be like for them, but that's it, you can only imagine.Overall, this movie was well-made, and while some of the acting was stiff by Hollywood standards, it didn't really get in the way of the story. I was able to somewhat relate to this movie because of my culture, but for many foreign movie-goers, the (Chinese) pop-culture references will fly right over their heads. Watch at your own risk."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"I actually saw this movie during a flight to Shanghai and really enjoyed it. Award winning Chinese actress/singer Zhao Wei makes her directorial debut in ""So Young"" and does a fine job. Most of the actors are newcomers, which I found refreshing. Lead female Yang Zishan's performance was great and I expect she will be a successful working actress for years to come.I won't write any spoilers or plot lines, but only say that this film simply deals with life - friendships, relationships, love, loss, the decisions we make in our youth and how those decisions shape our adult lives. These things are universal; one need not be Chinese to enjoy this picture. As an American, I found it to be wonderful."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"As a huge fan of the Asian cinema, then of course I jumped at the chance to sit down and watch ""So Young"" (aka ""Zhi wo men zhong jiang shi qu de qing chun"") when I got the chance to do so.The movie is very, very slow paced. And that made it quite an ordeal to actually sit through it.This is a movie that really doesn't have much of any appeal of any kind. And it had a rather pointless story to be bluntly honest. ""So Young"" had a rather good cast, and they all put on some very good acting performances. The characters in the movie were ones that you didn't really care about. Especially the Zheng Wei character was unfathomably annoying and just frustrating to the point of ruining the movie.I gave up after sitting through one hour of this ordeal of a movie. I just couldn't take it anymore."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"This movie reminds me of the movie ""You Are the Apple of My Eye. Nope, they are not similar in plot, but in the setting. Both are about school days, staying in hostel, growing up, lost time and youth. In fact, if you take a close look, there are certain angles where Zheng Wei (Yang Zishan) resembles Michelle Chen.So if you are a fan of the ""Apple of My Eye"" movie, I am sure you will love this movie too. Although, I prefer So Young. Perhaps it is because they didn't end with the characters marrying to someone else. I like how there were many surprises in the movie, despite it being a romantic comedy. The little ""magical effects"" where stories like Princess and the Pea, Cinderella, the Little Matchgirl were added in, making the 80s setting a little dreamier.You will hear a lot of laughter during the movie, not because it is comedic, but how everyone can actually relate to the humor in the film...More photos at http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/06/05/so-young-movie-review/"
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"""So Young"" is an appropriate title for this movie about a group of university students, but mostly about a girl, Zheng Wei, who, even several years later, still has a lot of growing up to do.The character I like most in this movie is Zheng Wei's boyfriend, Chen Xiaozhen. He kept growing. Though he didn't like her childish, scandalous, stalkerish behavior at first, he learned to love her. He might have been materialistic which was pretty evident from their first meeting when he pushed her to save his project, but he realized later on that success at the cost of failure as a person is not worth it. He came from a poor background so he wanted to better himself and not inflict his poverty on the one he loves. If he had a more supportive, less selfish girlfriend, she would have been happy with the opportunity that came his way. Instead, his too-full-of-herself girlfriend would have a hard time forgiving him for not putting her above everything else.I love the open ending. If they get back together, it would mean she has grown up and has shed off that ""I should matter the most in your life"" mentality. If they don't, there's hope he would find a girl more worthy of his affection and dreams. However, as I think over the last few minutes of the film right now, the ending might not be as open as it seems at first, once Zheng Wei finds out what Chen Xiaozhen told the dolphin trainer... But then it begs the question, why didn't he go ahead with his plan? So yeah, open-ending..."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"Seeing it as an Indian, with zero exposure to Chinese films or culture, the movie beautifully transcended all cultural barriers. Loved the youthfulness of the movie, though the lead character's ebullient nature was at times a little over the top! The college setting was true to life, not clichéd or hackneyed and the relationships forged also came across as genuine. Enjoyed how the four best friends have been given very distinct personalities. Spoiler: Would have liked to know more about the room mate who gets expelled from college. Really liked the way the different subplots came together in the end and that the director opted to leave an open end. And since it made me feel nostalgic about ""falling in love"", I'd say the movie has been able to convey romance just right!"
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"The romantic plot is good and the interpretations from the actors are fine, I recommend it."
致青春,So Young (2013),,2013,2013.4.25,"This movie just turns out to be one of my favorites in 2013. All i know about this movie before watching it is that it is a directorial debut of one of my favorite actress in Chinese cinema Zhao Wei. And her directing did not disappoint. I even wonder if some of those scenes were actual experiences of hers as the scenes were somewhat personal and very real. Its like i'm hearing her emotions through the lenses. I'm so totally impressed with the acting of the female lead and I hope I can see more of her in future movies. Also maybe i'm just a sucker for stories about youth and first love. Plus the movie deals with architecture which is the field i'm currently in thereby making the film more engrossing to me. That kissing scene where in the girl just opens her eyes in order not to forget the moment and the dolphin scene nailed it. Last year i saw a movie called Architecture 101, also about 1st love and architecture but this one is just better. If you want to see idols and cutesy love story then this film maybe is just not for you. I say part of this films effectiveness were the newbie actors and actresses. They made this film felt real. Again hats off to the new director Zhao Wei."

狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"A prequel of the colossal moneymaker DETECTIVE DEE AND THE MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME (2010, 7/10), which dominated the box office of Chinese National Holiday week (starts from 1st October) three years ago, and a similar (if not higher) lucrative income will repeat this year in the 7-days stretch too. Saw the 3D version inside a hustle-and-bustle local multiplex with a full house audience, righteously Hark Tsui's strenuous endeavor in the state-of-the-art technology of visual stunt pays off handsomely this time, the film confidently dispenses awesome CGI full views to parade Tang Dynasty's palatial splendor, and conjures up a PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN derivative island quest, with nighttime cliff skirmish proffers a taut engagement of amazement, culminates with a sea dragon showdown to gratify the long-awaited anticipation. Also there are ample presentations of novel martial art feats (anti-physics notwithstanding) to cater for the target audiences. But the film is at best to be referred as satisfying, compared to its predecessor, the whole ""dragon king"" case doesn't measure up to the intelligent reasoning required for a grave and ambitious scheme such as toppling over an entire nation, maybe it is because of a ""young"" detective Dee, not weathered enough yet. The freshly-recruited cast brings new and drop-dead gorgeous faces to the franchise (quintet of beauty,Chao, Feng, Lin, Kim and Angelababy in their prime appeal) , but they are all employed as chessmen to follow the procedure without any further digging into their personalities or plainly reduced to eye-candies. If one must pick the best from available, Carina Lau, majestically reprises her role as Empress Wu Zetian, years before the coronation, she already arbitrarily ministers the state affair behind the Emperor's throne. Stating the obvious, the franchise enjoys an ongoing and surging bankroll which will secure further follow-ups, one advise to the screenwriters, don't defame the word ""detective"", in addition to cook a feast for eyes and ears, our brains also need something palatable to feed on. Plus if the ultimate weapon to quell the monster is poisonous food, maybe we should all pray for the huddled mass in any rate."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"Legendary Hong Kong director Tsui Hark returns to the Tang Dynasty Sherlock Holmes character which, three years ago, gave his then-flailing film career a much needed shot in the arm. A prequel that sees Taiwanese actor Mark Chao stepping into the titular role once played so memorably by Andy Lau, 'Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon' also sees Tsui Hark building on his much-lauded maiden stereoscopic movie 'Flying Swords of Dragon Gate' by delivering a 3D spectacle that puts many of its Hollywood counterparts to shame. Yes, this is one of the rare films which boast of the 3D format that we will actually recommend paying to extra dollars just to see it with a pair of glasses on - and that is, we may add, from watching the 2D version no less.Following a rousing prologue that sees the mighty navy of the Tang Dynasty decimated at sea by a massive underwater creature, Chao's opening narration establishes the time and place of the events that follow. It is 665 AD, the joint reign of Emperor Gaozong (Sheng Chien) and the Empress Wu Zetian (Carina Lau) during a time when the country is at war with the Fuyu kingdom. Dee is set to take a job as a magistrate at the Dalisi based in the capital of Luoyang, an organisation whose mission is to keep the peace and investigate any disturbances.No thanks to the superstition of the common folk, the beautiful courtesan Yin Ruiji (Angelababy) is held as sacrifice to the sea monster at a temple. After he lip-reads a plot by some bad men to hold her ransom, Dee rushes to her rescue, only to be confronted by a human-like reptilian beast that slips away in the melee. Unfortunately for Dee, he isn't that lucky, his initiative to take action on his own earning the wrath of the head of the Dalisi, Yuchi Zhenjin (Feng Shaofeng), who throws him into prison.Dee's rivalry with Yuchi is one of the recurring themes of the story, which pits the two as intellectual equals racing to crack the case before Zetian has the latter's head for incompetence. It is in prison that Dee meets the Uighur prison doctor Shaluo Zhong (Lin Gengxin), who will become an effectual sidekick Dee relies on for advice - especially as it becomes clear that the explanations he seeks to the phenomena going on around them are medical in nature. Reunited with his 'Dee' scribe Zhang Jialu, Tsui Hark spins an intriguing mystery revolving around a nefarious conspiracy to overthrow the entire kingdom and its noblemen by an obscure fishing tribe known simply as the Dongdoers. Tsui's penchant for the fantastical remains intact here; and while the earlier 'Dee' had a talking deer, this one figures to throw in a white horse that can swim above and under water on its way to uncovering the origins of the 'Kraken'-like gargantuan monster as well as the half-human, half-reptile animal that seems obsessed with Ruiji. Granted that it does require some suspension of disbelief on the part of its viewer, but Tsui ultimately leaves no stone unturned in rationalising every single detail of his twisty plot.More so than in the first 'Dee' movie, this one finds Tsui on a much more assured directorial footing juggling a detective story with a good bit of palace intrigue and even tongue-in-cheek humour thrown in for good measure. One of the most amusing bits of the movie is the antidote Shaluo and his master (Chen Kun) comes up with to purge the palace officials of the parasitic infestation taking root in them, a truly delightful little detail that Tsui even uses to end the movie on a high note in a special scene in the middle of the closing credits. Tsui's storytelling is brisk and engaging from start to finish, connecting the dots ever so fluidly from clue to clue as he pieces together a mesmerising tapestry of schemes and secrets.Enabling his work at top form is an excellent technical team, most notably Kenneth Mak's exquisite production design, Lee Pik-kwan's opulent costumes and Bruce Yu's overall immaculate image design. It is as sumptuous a period epic as you have ever seen, and a most exciting one at that thanks to veteran action director Yuen Bun's cornucopia of gravity-defying wire-ful sequences. Bun and Lam Feng's choreography here most resembles that of Tsui's earlier 'wuxia' pictures, their integration with plenty of impressive CGI work clearly a product and testament of Tsui's vivid - and rather awe-inspiring - imagination that had also undoubtedly conceived the action in 3D right from the get-go. Amid the visual spectacle, it is to the actors' credit that their characters remain more than one-dimensional. Feng does solid work as the stern Yuchi whose initial strong distrust of Dee gives way to admiration and even respect. Carina Lau doesn't have much screen time as the Empress, but where she appears, is never less than captivating in her regalness. But perhaps the greatest surprise here is Chao, who tempers Andy Lau's showiness with quiet charisma and wry intelligence that gives the titular character a more down-to-earth but no less humbling stature.And once again therefore, Tsui Hark is back at the very top of his game with yet another outing of this Tang Dynasty sleuth. Coupling a finely spun mystery with splendid visuals and spellbinding martial arts action, Tsui cements his 'Dee' franchise as Asia's answer to Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes'. Indeed, the title of this movie is a befitting metaphor of Tsui's own work here, he the metaphorical sea dragon that has risen from the depths of his own doldrums to set the gold standard in blockbuster entertainment for Chinese cinema."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"Young Detective Dee is the adventures of a youthful Sherlock in Medieval China with state of the art CGI and a sea monster.The film starts with warships sent by Empress Wu destroyed by an unseen monster. Young Dee arrives in the capital city intending to become a detective with the Da Lisi police force. He already has a rival in Yuchi.However there is another monster attacking the city linked with a courtesan. Dee links up with a medic to find answers and gets the attention of the Empress.The film is fragmented with many plot lines, its a while before we see Yee's ability in detective work. What we do get is a sprawling adventure with gargantuan set pieces mixed with impressive CGI and some sly humour.At times the action overpowers the film which could had done been with being more concise. In some sense Young Dee is overshadowed in his own movie.It is still an impressive introduction of recent Chinese action- adventure cinema."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"I may be late watching this but boy am I glad I did!It really is a rare phenomenon when a sequel outshines its predecessor but I strongly feel that this is one of those occasions.The original Detective Dee, starring Andy Lau as the uber detective in ye olde China (Tang Dynasty), was a love hate affair for me. I liked the premise of watching a genius Sherlock Holmes style detective in ancient China, incredibly smart, adept at martial arts; it had all the ingredients for a brilliant character. The outcome, although not bad, just felt underwhelming and never quite lived up to my expectations. There was very little super intelligent crime-solving going on; the crime itself was not that interesting and the end result was just another Andy Lau movie.It looks like director extraordinaire, Tsui Hark, has since then really perfected the character. He's taken all the best elements from the original and fine-tuned them to produce this excellent movie. The story opens with an impressive attack on a royal fleet of ships by a mysterious sea monster, the eponymous beast of the title. This of course leads to high alert and panic in the city as towns-folk worry they have upset the gods. In a bid to make the gods happy, the simple towns folk plan to sacrifice the beautiful courtesan Yin (Angelababy). Meanwhile, detective Yuchi (Feng Shaofeng) is given a mandate and time limit within which to find out what is really going on by Empress Wu (Carina Lau). Failure to break the case within the allotted time will mean his death.Our hero, Dee Renjie (Mark Chao), arrives in the capital of Imperial China with a special commendation to be enlisted as part of the cities special police force. Before our young hero can even formally introduce himself to head Detective Yuchi, he stumbles on a plot to kidnap Angelababy by not only a group of thugs but also by a swamp monster man. Dee's superior intellect is apparent right from the outset, he can see things others can't, sees connections and figures out puzzles quicker than anyone else. This of course does not go unnoticed by Empress Wu. Much to detective Yuchi's annoyance, Dee is soon appointed head detective in charge of the case. But the humble detective Dee makes it clear he is not in the Imperial city for power, he simply wants to help people and uphold the law. He makes it clear that they must work together. Can Dee's intellect, Yuchi's fighting skills and help from their trustworthy assistant Dr. Watson Dr. Shatuo Zhong (Lin Gengxin), break the case??I really enjoyed this movie. At first I was concerned that a younger cast may make the on-goings less believable, but quite to the contrary, they got the age skew of the cast just right. The cast was fresh and, in the absence of baggage associated with big name leads, allowed for the characters to be realized and fleshed out much better. There is excellent chemistry between our lead, his doctor assistant and rival lead detective Yuchi. It's great watching them work together to break the case. Angelababy is great as eye candy but that's all she really is this time round, much less proactive than her character in Tai Chi Zero and much more the classic damsel in distress. Special mention needs to be made of the special effects, especially in the end sequence. I believe Tsui Hark enlisted the help of South Korean special affects maestros and the outcome is really pretty great.The movie may be a tad long, but I never felt it was lagging or getting boring in the way I did with the 2010 movie. In fact, I really didn't want the movie to end! I really enjoyed watching the story unfold, watching the trio investigate and piece together the puzzle. The excellent direction and acting ensured I was right there with them as the mystery unfolded. Some moments of perfectly timed humour (make sure you stay for the post-credits scenes) helped to further ensure I was hooked from start to finish.Dee is a great character, ultra smart, righteous and street savvy. He may be excellent at fighting but he's not the best. This just served to make the character more believable than the Andy Lau incarnation who was just too good at everything.A great movie and a really great character, this movie managed to hit all the points the original missed. I can't wait for the next Detective Dee movie!The only thing that would be better is a Sherlock Holmes and Detective Dee team up movie, but I guess I should keep dreaming.Highly recommended!Rating 9 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"I watch a fair amount of Asian cinema so I've seen a lot. This movie really stands out!First of all the quality and quantity of special effects are very good. The interaction between the main characters, the mix of dark story lines, and the humor suburb. Overall the underlying story is interesting and compelling.It's great fantasy fun!I'm surprised this movie doesn't have a higher rating and appears to have had not much of a presence here in America. It's too bad there is no English dubbed version (not that I know off), and, or, they just didn't market it enough for a Western audience. A lot of people will probably just bump into this movie late at night at one time or another and be pleasantly surprised.If you like action movies, epic fantasy stories, etc., you are probably going to love this movie."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"You have to have a soft spot for eastern movies and the fantasy world they are able to create. But then again, if you didn't why would you even bother watching or reading this, right? Maybe you are just curious because of the title. If that's the case, I'm not sure this is the best movie to start your ""experience"" with, but it is a very rock solid one and is entertaining.The ""detective"" aspect is like an added bonus to the fight scenes and the humor that drives the movie throughout. The effects are pretty decent and fight scenes are very well choreographed. You don't have to have seen the previous movie to enjoy this either. A nice little movie to have fun with then"
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"OK, perhaps a bit cultural centric but if you imaginatively wanted to know what Sherlock was doing in a previous life long ago, well, quite a long time ago then Dee is your man. Haven't decided yet whether he needs a Watson since he's so Renaissance capable. Great sets, graphics - hopefully they did their research and most (excluding the fantastical parts, of course) of the visuals are authentic recreations. Martial arts scenes were typical wire with a bit more spins and tumbles and even more not so believable jumps. Acting is OK but not important as this film is about thought provoking storyline and dialogue. Speaking of dialogue it would be helpful if the subtitles stayed on a bit longer as we have to process both language and the visual nearly at once."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"I'm surprised at overwhelmingly positive reviews for this film on here, because I feel like I watched a different film. Okay, I didn't like the original DETECTIVE DEE to begin with, so perhaps expecting to enjoy this one was doomed from the outset, but I had no idea I'd be sitting through one of the dumbest, most CGI-laden fantasy adventures since EMPEROR AND THE WHITE SNAKE.If this is the way Chinese fantasy cinema is going, then I despair. YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is a hopeless mess of a film, a sprawling action-adventure chock full of some of the worst CGI you'll ever see. As this is a 3D film, the viewer is constantly assailed by extremely poor looking CGI weapons flying out of the screen, but that's not enough. There's CGI jumping, CGI horses, CGI buildings, CGI backdrops, CGI everything really. Only the sea monster itself is a halfway decent bit of CGI. Everything else looks horrible, fake, like in a poor PC game.The plot is nonsensical and long-winded and even when the villain is apprehended it somehow goes on for another hour or so. The actor playing the youthful Dee is wooden and uninteresting and with no big names in the cast list you're struggling for something to enjoy. The comic relief guy with the ape's arm is okay, I suppose. Tsui Hark seems to have plowed THE AVENGERS for inspiration, what with the incessant CGI action and the big angry green bloke, but his film is a total failure by comparison. YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE is a dog of a film, one that's packed to the brim with action but constantly bores you nonetheless."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"There are plenty of entertaining action scenes in this movie, ranging from wire fu fighting to large scale CGI-monster fighting. These are imaginatively filmed and have some nice touches, even if here's nothing as good as the best action scenes from the previous Detective Dee movie, Phantom Flame.In between action, there is a very poorly told story.Actually, ""story"" is an exaggeration. It's more like a collection of incidents told in a particularly order. Everything just kind of happens. A ship battle results in disaster! A woman in a mask is in trouble! There's a merman! There are bandits! There's a new detective! There's a swimming horse! There are poison flowers! Everything is introduced by someone just saying, here is this thing that we need right now.There's a general rule in film that if the hero is going to pull out a gun in the final act, you want to establish that he owns a gun earlier on. That doesn't happen in this movie. Instead, there's a problem, and suddenly someone says, I know who can help, or, I've got the solution right here, or, the solution is at this place let's go right now.This is how a ten-year-old writes a story.No character development, little motivation, no real coherence. Dee's Sherlock Holmes deductions are generally unpersuasive.It's a dumb story, badly told, but the action scenes almost make up for that. Almost."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"This is the first time i write a review at IMDb, please go easy on me, thanks! I was not expecting high on this movie because i was accompany my friend to watch it, what this movie got? High def quality in video & audio - checked! Good kungfu fighting scene - checked! Battle with sea monster(better than Pirate of the Caribbean) - checked! With these 3 factors, it already worth my money and time spent in the cinema! Acting is average among the casts, but Carina Lau definitely nailed it, WuZheTian is alive with her acting! The story is average, although it want to be like Sherlock Holmes, but the case they investigating didn't left much clue, just waiting the director to show us. Overall, it is the best Chinese WuXia film i watched in the recent years!"
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"The first film, the Phantom Flame was a true intellectual adventure. We start to think we are watching a fantasy, with talking deer and such, then Dee figures out the tricks and it's all science or at least science fiction. There was a strong attempt to keep the story grounded in reality. I know the fights still used all the wire stuff, but it did not seem has hokey as in this movie. This film is just pure fantasy from the start, with phony fighting and monsters. What's weird is they had a good story with a plausible scientific plot, then they threw all this phony stuff on top of it. I found myself laughing at it several times and not in a good way. Why bother with the logical story, if you are going to have magic all around it?"
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"""Di Renjie: Shen Du Long Wang"" or ""Young Detective Dee: Rise Of The Sea Dragon"" is a prequel to ""Detective Dee And The Mystery Of The Dragon Flame"". It takes place in the beginning years of Tang Dynasty under the reign of the weak Emperor Gaozong and just a few years before his cruel wife Wu Zetian would take his position and declare the second Zhou dynasty for fifteen years. This second movie shows us a young detective who arrives at the imperial city and has to face a lot of adversary, jealousy and mistrust. The case itself features two different story lines. First of all, there is a giant sea monster controlled by a mysterious enemy that attacks the imperial fleet. The other story features the beautiful courtesan Yin who is about to be sacrificed in order to appease the Gods and therefor the sea monster but who gets first kidnapped by a gang of thieves and later on by a strange human lizard creature. Both stories are loosely bound together and lead the detective and his new colleagues and friends to an adventurous mission on Bat Island.If you liked the first movie of the franchise, my guess is that you will also appreciate the sequel. It's really a matter of nuance if you prefer the first or the second movie as both pretty much have the same flaws and strengths. Just as the first instalment, the sequel convinces with elegant and typically exaggerated fighting scenes in Tsui Hark's unique signature style that goes back to classic Hongkong movies of the late eighties and early nineties like ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" or ""Once Upon A Time In China"". I must admit that the over-the-top fighting scenes on the ships towards the end of the movie are probably the most impressive sequences of both movies.The modern elements can be found in several decent CGI effects for the monsters in this movie as well as during the destruction of the fleet and the showdown on and around Bat Island. I must admit that I thought that some of these modern elements did not fit to the historical settings which are colourful and beautiful to watch but not always authentic. It's simply strange to see ultra-modern visual elements in a movie that takes place in the seventh century. I prefer the more limited but authentic settings of more traditional Hongkong movies.While the first movie had some more investigative elements, the sequel only features a couple of these. Detective Dee surely passes as a smart person and some of his investigative methods are still really impressive. Sadly, the movie quickly reveals friends and foes which means that there aren't any real mysteries to solve. The only element I would have liked to know isn't really answered after all. We don't get to know how the sea monster was created and how comes that it sometimes obeys the villains and sometimes it doesn't.As for the acting, the leading actors do an average job as some of them lack depth. Angela Yeung is simply a good-looking woman in love with a poet, that's it. The makers of the movie could have chosen any of the many good-looking Chinese actresses as Angela Young's character lacks uniqueness and feels like a hollow puppet to me. The jealous chief minister portrayed by Feng Shaofeng, the young prison doctor played by Lin Gengxin as well as Detective Dee himself who is now portrayed by Taiwanese-Canadian actor Mark Chao instead of Hongkong actor Andy Lau who was a little bit more charming in my opinion, all have interesting characteristics but remain somewhat superficial. Instead of focusing on special effects, the makers of the movie should have worked a little bit more on the character development.This sequel is a colourful, effect-ridden, fast-paced movie that doesn't fail to entertain and which includes a few impressive investigative methods, beautiful settings and stunning fighting scenes. On the other side, the story is much simpler than in the first film and the actors are mostly exchangeable or stereotypical as in the case of the crazy doctor for example. Fans of modern Hongkong cinema and historical fiction where traditional elements are overrun by modern effects will like this movie. Everyone else is invited to watch this fun ride once but more sophisticated viewers will probably forget about this film pretty soon. I still think that the concept behind this franchise has some potential and hope that there will be a third movie and that's why I'm willing to rate this film seven points instead of only six."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"Tsui Hark is back again with his latest fantasy-action-drama-adventure-thriller epic - Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon, which serves as a prequel to Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame released in 2010.The film tells how the young Dee rise to become a respectable detective for the Tang Dynasty, befriends the doctor Shaluo (similar to Sherlock Holmes and Watson) and his rival, Chief Commissioner/Detective Yuchi, unravels and solves an intriguing mystery case which involves a plot to assassinate the royal family and palace officials to overthrow the entire kingdom.In order to fully enjoy the film, it requires some suspension of disbelief from the audience for some of the fantasy or action elements shown in the film such as riding a horse underwater, 'Kraken' beast, parasites that can change a person's looks and behaviour entirely, flying around fighting in the air, etc.Although the wire-action choreography was great and well handled throughout the film, but the action scenes gets a little too much and it feels tedious to watch as the film moves on. It took away the focus of the mystery plot and a lot of potential character development required in the film. However, most of the lead and supporting actors did a fine job in portraying their character roles.The CGI has improved a lot and looked believable and realistic compared with past Chinese big budget films. Overall, it's still a watchable, entertaining Chinese big budget production comparable to Hollywood standards."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"When you have a great story, a good character, a budget to do practically whatever you want and a talent for spawning something visually appealing, you come to a movie like this. Another wonder of Tsui Hark, with a story as elaborate as it is amazing. It is a film where the improbable and the impossible becomes everyday, where you must give yourself to the experience of immersing yourself in a fantasy world where wonder is the food of our eyes and ears. Detective Dee must again solve a problem that has dramatic elements and where betrayal is dormant in every frame. Great entertainment that ensures a dazzling experience."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"Empress Wu (Carina Lau) will not allow the enemy forces invading Baekje Kingdom to win. She orders a garrison of warships to bring assistance to their allies, but the calm seas they are to sail upon are immediately fraught with peril, as an unseen monster completely decimates everything in its path. It is a colossal loss, and the beginning of the film that is Young Detective Dee.Dee (Mark Chao) arrives in Luoyang, under orders to become a detective with the Da Lisi, the Capital's police force. Working alongside him in his quest for answers is Yuchi (Shaofeng Feng), who has little faith in Dee's capabilities, and a doctor, Shatuo (Lin Gengxin) who Dee appoints to assist. But the mountainous paranoia and fear gripping the Capital escalates when it's revealed there isn't just one monster attacking the city, but two, one of which is directly linked to the beautiful courtesan Yin (Angelababy).What is most impressive about the film Young Detective Dee is its flawless ability to come together, after originally feeling so fragmented at the beginning, with a vast quantity of plots being moved about like pawns in a chess game. At the same time however, this is potentially its greatest flaw, the chronologically directed film being tied together in a nice little bow. In the end, there are no unanswered questions, and because of this, the film fails to stay with you after the credits have finished.Although the movie is titled 'Young Detective Dee', Mr. Chao's Dee, despite been very likable and intelligent, occasionally seems to be out-staged by Mr. Feng's interpretation of Yuchi, a feat accomplished by their similar screen presence. Though Yuchi is the direct opposite to Dee, the film seems to fail in its attempt to develop Dee as the lead character.The feature contains a number of the stereotypes often found in Chinese action films, including brilliant fight scenes, an intriguing conspiracy, and a gorgeous young woman, although Young Detective Dee also incorporates a wealth of beautiful visuals. The special effects are exceptionally outstanding, rivaling Hollywood's technical capabilities, and the acrobatic fight scenes, if not occasionally a little fake, are just as effective, but even more so with Kenji Kawai's impressive score. Moreover, the use of humor brings a lively sense of amusement, and nicely prohibits the film from becoming too serious. In a feature which contains fantastical elements, the logical explanation to this uniquely original case, which incorporates science and medicine, is a highly interesting concept, however, this originality does not stem throughout the entirety of the feature.Some of Dee's detective skills mimic those seen recently in the American adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, while a number of the weapons share a similarity with those wielded in the Guillotines. A number of the ocean scenes will in all likelihood remind viewers of Pirates of the Caribbean, while one particular action scene set on a cliff, appears to be ripped right out of GI Joe Retaliation. Each of these particular components are fabulously executed, although the 'been there, done that' feel leaves the viewer hungry for something more.Furthermore, a number of the action scenes seem to continue for longer than they should, and though each will surely entertain, this is accomplished by sacrificing the viewer's interest. One thing I fundamentally enjoy about Chinese cinema is I am almost always wowed by their action scenes, and though the scope and ambition of Young Detective Dee was massive, I was never hanging off the edge of my seat. On top of this, a number of the action scenes failed to employ any sense of realism, and even suspending one's own disbelief cannot justify how some of the characters are able to walk away unharmed from the massive fights they endured.Young Detective Dee is a solid action film that won't keep you guessing, but will certainly keep your attention with its outstanding visuals. Though American films often have an over reliance on special effects, Chinese features are seldom similar in this respect, and this particular film's attempts to potentially impersonate a Hollywood feature is a decision that should not be attempted again lightly."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"I didn't know that ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" (aka Di Renjie: Shen du long wang"") was directed by legendary director Tsui Hark. So of course, seeing this definitely put some expectations to the movie.I must admit that while this Wu Shu action drama definitely has a good production, the storyline just failed short of being overly interesting. The plot and script just felt too generic and failed to stand up to the usual level of movies from Tsui Hark.The acting in the 2013 movie ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" was actually good, and they had some nicely cast Chinese actors and actresses in the movie to perform the various roles. Now, I am not overly familiar with Mark Chao (playing Dee Renjie), but he definitely carried the movie quite well.There is a lot of action in the movie, lots of wire-fu of course, as this is a Wu Shu martial arts movie. So expect lots of over-the-top jumping around and performing feats that no one ever could actually do. So that is of course an acquired taste, some like it, some don't.For me, then ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" just felt like Tsui Hark embarked on a journey of wanted to accomplish a little bit more than he could muster here. And the movie felt like it didn't come full circle, leaving me somewhat disappointed when it ended.""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" is definitely watchable, however it is not a movie that stands out as being remarkable in the mainland Chinese cinema, nor is it the finest moment in Tsui Hark's director career. Watchable sure, but mildly enjoyable."

狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"At the ending of the scene, the Dragon appeared. It attacked the ship. Suddenly I realized that I saw this scene before. Yes, it was from the Dead Mans Chest big octopus scene from the Pirate of the Caribbean. The producer seemed to copy it from American Movies. It is not original.Pirates of the Caribbean The Kraken Battle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8EGbz4PuwIf you compare it, it is the same identical plot.The title is not suitable for the story. The actors performed well. Feng Shao Feng is a rising star from the TV hit. I'm Chinese but I don't speak or understand Mandarin. I watch the Chinese drama and movies from Youtube or viki.com. Sadly AMC theatre was empty. I and one couple were the only audience on thursday at 4:40 At AMC Bay (Emeryville, CA).The movies should translate in English; not subtitle. I had trouble following it because it changed too fast. Too much fighting and I'm not sure about the story. That is one problem I don't care for Chinese movies. It is all about fighting and lacked of plot. I hook on Korean drama. I also digged up some of the producer past movies. And, they were terrible. This one is amazingly well done as far as using the technology to create the product that is good as Hollywood."

狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"Sense some HOMES there,but thinks that's all right..the story has some nice turning points.good to go movie.."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"I fall squarely in the camp of those who prefer this sequel to the original... I found Detective Dee to be a better made film in the sense that the acting was strong, time was spent on character development, tighter production values, etc., but somehow it was far from satisfying to an American sensibility. The Dee character wasn't strong or clever enough, the writing didn't come to a satisfactory conclusion, and the story was poor in both pacing and structure. There was hardly any 'detective' to Detective Dee.This prequel, though lighter weight and more far-fetched in almost every other way, is at very least more entertaining. The characters are clearly drawn with obvious strengths and weaknesses, the film moves at a fast clip and yet manages to avoid being too confusing, and the first ending, the fight on Bat Island, delivers a sufficient payoff. Unfortunately Tsui Hark can't keep himself from concluding with a huge and derivative effects sequence, but at that point the film was essentially over. And don't miss the mid-credits comedy bits, cute enough to be worthwhile."
狄仁杰之神都郡王,Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013),,2013,2013.9.28,"If you enjoy eastern kungfu movies, this is a good one to watch. It has some plots in it as the ""detective"" name implies. The plots are not so deep, but does a decent job to make you keep guessing as to who is behind the evil plot and what will happen next.The fight scene is well choreographed and plots are pretty well tied together. The CGI is OK, not great when they try to do the ocean scenes, but much better on land fighting scenes. The slow-motion camera work made up for any flaws.Dee is portrayed as very cunning and perceptive individual.At the end of the day, it is a kungfu movie. A decent one to sit through for entertainment and plot intrigue."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"Finding Mr. Right is a decent, well-executed romantic comedy that stands out among many China film productions. It's smart, occasionally funny at times, and surprisingly touching, drawing numerous references from the classic romantic comedy, 'Sleepless in Seattle', which influences the film's climax.It's charming and somewhat delightful to watch the lead female character, Jia Jia's personal transformation from a spoilt, obnoxious, stubborn, high maintenance, materialistic, hateful woman to a down-to-earth, caring and admirable grown mother. It's a strong character that requires good performance, which Tang Wei delivers with her charming presence.Finding Mr. Right offers nothing new in the genre and it may certainly look common or feels like any romantic comedies out there by others, but the solid storytelling,convincing love chemistry between the two lead characters allow it to shine. It's a significant improvement, or possibly a breakthrough for the Chinese film industry."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"This is a good movie with reality and romantics. The best part is the leading couple are so attracted to each other that it is so obvious that they are in love. Frank is such a nice, sweet hubby that every girl would want one. Well, younger would be better. Also, it is such a good representation for new immigrants when they are not well settle down yet. Frank was a famous surgeon in Beijing but jobless after immigrant to Seattle. During struggling to gain credits back as a doctor, his ex-wife decided to leave him. Everyone tease him as a loser except his daughter who is the main reason that he moves to States. Yet facing all the down point ahead, Frank still keeps his mode as much of nice, considerate, and positive. His eyes are full of love, looking at his ex-wife, his young girl friend, and his daughter. It is interesting to see Frank's personality gradually changed from Jiajia's point of view. He is a loser and lousy driver to her when they first meet. Later on, after knowing he used to be a famous cardiologist, she thinks he is coward and tends to help him in an aggressive way. Yet after she almost die from the delivery, she finds he is reliable. But Frank didn't change at all, except at the end he gained a little career success, starting his residency. It is actually Jiajia's personality had been changed. I love the final reunion at the Empire State Building although it seems too much coincidence. Has to admit that the leading couple's performance are quite conservative which is Chinese tradition. Frank can see love in her eyes, yet she is not sure if he is still available. When he finally hold her hands, she is the happy Annie who she does always want to be as in the move, Sleepless in Seatle."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"excited to write the first ever movie review on IMDb--since finally the ban of the website has been lifted. this movie shouldn't have been the one i start with because it isn't good. i planned to watch Django unchained with my bf while found out it was banned in China. so we watched that instead because he told me it was good. so i dumped him afterward for bad movie choice. first of all, it is very popular in China for some reasons. there ain't many good foreign movies that are allowed to show in cinemas in China thus people's aesthetic view for movie still remain on the basic level. most Chinese movies achieve its popularity by mass promotion and featuring famous/attractive actors/actresses. this is one of these kind of movies. the story line is a bit flat. it tells a story of a pretty gold digger who was a mistress of a rich businessman from BJ met someone in Seatle and found true love. she realised true love and happiness wasn't about money. i find either the script writing or how the theme was presented is very boring. there are a few plots are not smoothly presented at all. Tang Wei is very pretty, but her acting is awful. i don't see there was a spark or chemistry between two leading roles. but in reality, in China, i never see much spark between most couples which is sad. i don't see the passion in their eyes!!! the only bit i would praise about this film is that in an era of deteriorating morality of a society, being a mistress and gold digger is not uncommon, and it is not something to be ashamed of, a movie like this does remind Chinese people the true meaning of love and happiness. it based in reality ground and it presents positive meaning. Chinese film industry has a long way to go. I'm not going to watch another Chinese film any time soon."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"The movie is supposed to be a Chinese ""chick-flick"" according to some interviews given by the producers. And it absolutely served its purpose, for that sake I say ""congratulations, well done"".In a Hollywood romance movie, we knew in the very beginning who and whom are going to end up together however during the course some misunderstanding or fight is bound to take place (but really, admit it, you kind of want and enjoy such a pattern - otherwise why would you pick the genre unless your significant other forced you into it?). This one isn't from Hollywood but it's no exception. So why do I say it's a good piece? 1, Polished scripts. The story is well founded and well developed. Pregnant women coming to the US to give birth is widely known and a shadow industry has boomed in some cities in the west coast. Middle classes immigrating to the US only to find themselves lost and without a decent job is another popular topic. Blending these together, the director/writer has the main characters present you how these people fare in their new lives (and develop love to serve the movie's purpose). When the film carries on the two leading roles, each representing their own type, cross paths and sort of help each other out in their own ways over a series of interesting episodes and amusing confrontations. These episodes are carefully set up therefore do feel authentic, they really can happen in the American life. And from time to time the movie throws in some witty twists and surprises (such as Julie's little revenge with NYPD, and the sympathetic female cop, etc.), which build up laughs very well. The progression is well paced and the settings are down to details.2, Satisfactory performances. Tang Wei is famous for her heroine role in Ang Lee's ""Lust, Caution"", during which she delivered all the tension, pains, and struggles. Now she takes on comedy again (she once lead in another comedy ""Crossing Hennessy"", which fared poorly but not her fault). I was not impressed with the beginning scenes in the airport - the dancing gimmicks were not necessary - however with the movie goes on she got much better, especially after the character started to befriend others and show her sweetness. She eventually gave a sound execution of the change required for the role. The leading actor, Wu Xiubo, can be a little too reserved with his role, a henpecked good-husband, but the performance is overall decent. All supporting roles are consistent and some of them can even steal the show for a moment.The movie was an instant commercial success and I think it well deserves it. For me it's a solid 7/10. Although it's not my favorite genre, I hope the Chinese movie industry can brew up more of these quality pieces for its own good. It really isn't that hard as long as you put in efforts right?"
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,I love a sappy ending...and accompanied by Louis Armstrong and a sound track full of emotion.
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"Ye, it isn't perfect or classic, but it will be a milestone on the development of China film production. All elements that should appear in a romantic movie are included in this film, and they are not just rote, but experienced and nature.So, what about our standard of reviews? Maybe shouldn't absolutely, but relatively? Another question, are we sure about our absolute standard that is corrective all the time, from 1900 to 2100? If can't be all the time, what about all the world?In my opinion, as to China romantic film now days,this movie has a important meaning， and it deserve better rate."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"Normally I am a huge fan of Asian cinema, so of course I jumped at the chance to sit down and watch ""Finding Mr. Right"" (aka ""Bei Jing yu shang Xi Ya Tu"") believing it to be a romantic comedy that is seen in abundance from the Hong Kong cinema.Running at over 2 hours, this movie turned out to be an unfathomably boring ordeal to suffer through. And I must admit that I gave up 70 minutes into the movie out of sheer and utter boredom.The characters in the movie were generic, flat and lacking screen charisma. The cast, however, were adequate, although they were given next to nothing to work with in terms of characters, plot and story.The movie was so incredibly slow paced and with the fact that next to nothing happened, it just prolonged the agony and suffering, making it unbearable to sit through.Director and writer Xiaolu Xue didn't manage to produce a captivating story here and the movie was just not particularly appealing on any level. Especially when there are so many other far more entertaining, funny and enjoyable movies in the Asian cinema, and more specifically from Hong Kong.I have no intention of returning to watch ""Finding Mr. Right"" because it just failed to impress on any level. Nor do I have any intention of sitting down to watch the sequel that it spawned."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"So cute and adorable, the title didn't do the work justice, at least the translation wasn't happy, giving the false idea of an exaggerated comedy about women looking for males to marry (?!?!?!) and the backdrop dramatic, pregnant Chinese women helpless in their country by traditions and lack of assistance, looking for safety in the land of achievements, and the ""American dream"", very cute, with a light social criticism and amusing presentation... And the soundtrack that moves us..."
北京遇上西雅图,Finding Mr. Right (2013),,2013,2013.3.21,"Romances the most crucial point is the casting, the heroine of the audience like it or not, a man will not make fantasy female audience, it is vital that other scenes, shapes, lines, are role. Tang Wei and Wu Xiubo such a combination is seductive, and the new idea of ​​audience interest and recognition, called this film the most crucial. Movie characters grow around Tang Wei gradually transformed from a worships money and girls know what is most needed. Overall, her spiritual growth in this story is completed, a reality more closely tied to the theme, and be able to speak to understand the audience agree to do this, in terms of really made ​​films can be considered victory. Tang Wei and Wu Xiubo pursuing a classic emotional journey in the film began to look at each other not pleasing to the eye, after understanding gradually seduces route. Xiubo acting bring to live a little too far Tang Wei, increase the credibility of this relationship. Empire State Building reunion of the classic plot had earned in the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" tears of the female audience, ""encounter Seattle"" copy of the trip, although a little too clever, but to convince the audience does not care about so more details, look forward to usher in a happy ending. So, the domestic romantic drama at the present stage, the most important thing is to choose the right actor and Exotic plot. As for the higher stage to encourage female audience to find themselves, and so the theme is temporarily not able to complete the task at this stage."
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"No doubt the box-office success of this movie in China is giving it legs to cross into international territory, but we suspect that 'Tiny Times' - directed and adapted by novelist Guo Jingming from his series of bestselling books - is unlikely to find an appreciative audience overseas. A portrayal of the lifestyles of the new-rich who have rode on the waves of China's recent economic boom, it is as shallow and superficial as the lives of the people it aims to portray - and that's a fact not lost on even some of its Mainland Chinese audiences, who have criticised it for glamourising materialism.To be sure, that isn't a problem in itself - after all, Hollywood has also been guilty of dishing out such trivial pleasures, the most well- known examples being 'Sex and the City' and 'Gossip Girl'. But what makes this 'SATC' wannabe - that should otherwise be known as 'Sexless in Shanghai City' - frustrating is how daft each and every one of its four lead characters are, whether in terms of love or career or simply being responsible friends. Yes, it's appalling how they take turns to screw up, jump to conclusions or demonstrate their ego, which makes it quite impossible for us to rally around them and their supposed bond of bosom friendship.But before we launch into that tirade, let's be clear on one thing. We've no issues about this movie being a vehicle of wish-fulfilment for the masses. Indeed, Guo's tale of Lin Xiao (Mini Yang), Lily (Amber Kuo), Nan Xiang (Bea Hayden) and Tang Wanru's (Hsieh Yi-lin) search for love and success in cosmopolitan Shanghai probably just about epitomises the dream of every young Chinese male and female adult. Ditto for their lifestyle of high-rise apartments, designer bags, cutting-edge fashion and luxury bags - judge them all you want, but those symbols of status are just what every high-achiever in China is after.So we're not here to quibble over the little lapses in logic, even though some audiences are less likely to be as kind. We therefore won't question how Lin Xiao for instance, despite her clumsy and careless ways, manages to secure a coveted position as assistant to fashion bible M.E. Magazine's editor-in-chief Gong Ming (Rhydian Vaughan). Neither will we question how Lily manages to be a Chief Financial Officer despite being fresh out of college. Perhaps even more significantly, we won't even start asking how in the first place the four girls became such inseparable friends, despite the fact that there is little we see which in fact binds them together.And yet even with such concessions, what transpires is just plain dreadful. Why Gong Ming or his other more senior assistant Kitty would put up with Lin Xiao's mistakes time and time again escapes us, particularly since the former is said to be exacting and the latter unsympathetic to under-performing employees; but what really takes the cake is why Lin Xiao would accept Gong Ming's gift of an engagement ring that he says he doesn't need anymore, which then leads to a huge misunderstanding with her boyfriend Jian Xi (Li Ruimin).Lily gets the even shorter end of the stick, confronted with a rough patch in her once rock-solid relationship with Gu Yuan (Kai Ko) after the latter's mother disapproves of her and seeks to marry him off to an even wealthier family. This isn't even a rich-poor divide; it's that of the rich-and-richer, so ludicrous and poorly defined that one feels no empathy or anything whatsoever for what becomes of the two of them. And would you believe it, their rift begins when Jian Xi calls Gu Yuan, hears a female picking up the call, and proceeds to tell Lin Xiao and Nan Xiang of Gu's suspected infidelity - so much for being a responsible friend.Fortunately for Nan Xiang and Wanru, they are spared much of the inanity by simply being afterthoughts. Aside from the contrived finale, Nan Xiang's struggling fashion designer hardly gets much screen time other than an ill-conceived but thankfully barely-elaborated subplot involving a former boyfriend Xi Cheng (Jo Jiang). Ditto for stocky badminton player Wanru, whose crush on another well-chiselled player Wei Hai (Calvin Tu) gets all about five minutes of play. Nonetheless, it also means that for most of the time, we have to put up with idiotic characters whom we just want to slap some common sense into.That's doubly disappointing if you consider how Guo's writing experience should in fact make him a good storyteller; instead, we are not only made to endure a first-time director's poor sense of narrative continuity, but also his half-baked tale of immature characters and their childish whims. And no, the fact that he had cast eye candies Mini Yang, Amber Kuo and Taiwan-born Eurasian model Bea Hayden doesn't quite make up for it - even though there's no denying that Yang and Kuo display plenty of sass in their respective roles.As you can probably tell, this is a movie designed specifically to go easy on the eye. Besides the ladies, the guys have also been chosen from some of the most eligible young actors from the Mainland and Taiwan. It's not about the fact that it's fluffy - we do enjoy our guilty pleasures - but it's about how plain stupid the characters are, trapped in their own little well of incompetence, pettiness and ignorance. Unless you have specifically come to ogle, this is one vacuous romantic fantasy that is as empty as it is tiny and ultimately inconsequential. www.moviexclusive.com"
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"Looks like a Devil Wears Prada copycat movie. But no, it's filled with junk.Seriously, if you see this, you'll find, plot-wise, it's about nothing. Lines are cheap with no taste. Acting? Don't get me started with acting. All you are ever gonna see in it is pretty people, fancy places and luxury brands. If you think this movie bombed at the box office then you are terribly wrong. They made almost 80 million dollars out of this which is not bad at all in China. I'm afraid it's what the young Chinese like these days. And guess what, the sequel will be out in august right this year!"
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"I have never seen such a ugly film and i think 郭敬明 can receive Razzie Award . Tiny Times tells the story of friendship between four girls from high school through college, with each girl also having her own love story. With a bit of a mix between The Devil Wears Prada and Gossip Girl, the story is told from the perspective of one of the girls who is an intern at a fashion and literature magazine. Differently, however, her boss is a handsome young man. Guo's own image is also reflected in the characters, but split into two roles: editor-in-chief of the magazine and an idolized young writer. Just like Guo's real life - a publisher who always prepares a plan B and a boy from a small town who gets famous at 17 and must face the pressure and loneliness of the world - the writer's characteristics and personality are recognizable in the film. The casting fits perfectly into different roles. These good-looking actors and actresses, mostly famous for pop television series or advertisements, all have their own fan base. However, it seems the acting potential of these young stars is not reflected in the film. Lead actor Ko Chen-tung's performance in Tiny Times is said to be not as good as what he did in You Are the Apple of My Eye. Few of the roles are fully represented even though the film is filled with voice-over to introduce the background. One of the ex-boyfriends, who can always lead to a strong emotional reaction from the girls, only appears twice in the whole movie. For those in the audience who never read the book, unconnected scenes and unreal details are everywhere. For instance, an extremely rich family does not have a guest room and has to tell the girl staying over the night to sleep in the room with the son - the college student played by Ko. In another example, the girl who carries different Dior bags everyday cries to borrow money from her boyfriend because she cannot afford a crystal glass she broke in her boss' office. The problem of featuring multiple leading characters but not making careful use of them all is a common problem for those new to filmmaking. For instance, Zhao Wei who directed So Young made similar mistakes. Spin off success Nevertheless, from a purely commercial point-of-view, adapting the story for the big screen is wonderful. Long before the film was released, gossips about Tiny Times and Guo appeared all over the place. More than half of the members of the production team come from Taiwan, a place where films specifically target young audiences with its own unique style. As a result, the fashionable setting and glamorous photography are comparable to the best chick flicks Chinese audiences have seen before. Various attractive trailers, music videos and promotional posters all suggested the film's potential of becoming the most popular film of the year as long as the script and film languages reached an average professional level. The film remains loyal to the novel and the script was also written by Guo. The major problems seem to stem from a filming style that looks like a string of TV commercials all stitched together. The result is a collection of scenes that are unlikely to satisfy film critics and industry insiders. What Guo has done is more like producing a mood piece or a long music video as a spin off for the book to fans who admire the invisible ""vanity fair"" that was created in the book. Controversy as a trend Controversy about a film is no longer a surprise. However, the discussions about Tiny Times have created a phenomenon that audiences could have totally opposite opinions towards almost every part of the film. The series of books, Tiny Times (1.0/2.0/3.0), have boosted controversy since first coming out five years ago. Guo's target readers are teenagers. What he became famous for was mainly beautiful languages and because of this, the excessive desire for luxuries mentioned in his books is seen as having a negative effect on youngsters who are still building up their values and ideologies. Such issues continue to be the main point of contention between the two camps that either love or hate the stories. The most frequent comment, especially by those who have no background knowledge of the novel, is that the story illustrates a warped value system-luxury labels appear every few minutes. The argument that Chinese films generally have been overly ""teachy"" and perhaps in the past spent too much time on values should allow the critics to switch focus on other problems or qualities that the film has. If the story was constructed upon an imaginary space like Twilight, some of the audience might forgive Guo's unrealistic details. Or, if the story was just about upper-class lifestyle like Gossip Girl, it would also be fine for many film critics. The main shortcoming lies on the contradiction that Guo wants to portray different people from different social backgrounds to reflect the status of the young generation in the current time period, as the name Tiny Times suggests. But the luxurious lifestyle and cartoon like characters are too much of a daydreamer's fairytale. Guo's success as a businessman is indubitable, but the film Tiny Times is exactly the same as the book - full of beautiful surface elements and never enough careful consideration. The disagreement between fans and film critics is a mirror of the gap between different generations. Youngsters would ask, what's so amazing about really deep thoughts?"

小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"This film tells the story of four high school friends, who navigate the high world of fashion together in their unique way.""Tiny Times 1.0"" has a big cast from both China and Taiwan, and clearly is aiming to be commercially successful. The story serves exactly that purpose, it's as commercial as can be. In fact, the film is so one dimensional and superficial. The characters are soulless, especially the boss of the fashion magazine, Mr Gong. The guy playing him is handsome, but it stool doesn't give him am excuse to be expressionless constantly, just like a cardboard cutout. The characters are very superficial, especially the powerful businesswoman. The scenes of her friends crowning her are almost unbelievable, eye rolling bad! The addition of an unattractive sidekick on the gang is a little surprising. She is quite annoying, and to be honest I'd rather her be as superficial as the other three girls, in order to get a bit of consistency."
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"I feel like this movie might have had some potential, but I think it falls flat with the characters. If you enjoy this movie, more power to you, I'm happy you enjoy it. However, this film was full of expensive brands and rich people that left it feeling ultimately shallow and something that not a whole lot of people relate to. The main protagonist is whiny and not somebody I could root for. I feel like she took a job way above her ability and essentially dragged her friends into all of her problems and cried. I feel like this is a film that really could have used a prequel film to establish the relationship of all the characters, and how they grew so close. We are just thrown in and are expected to know and accept that all of these people are close. Not to mention it didn't have a central message that was impactful. While the production quality is nice, I feel this film is lacking a lot in core character development, as well as relatable elements that an audience can connect to.However, I am a Western citizen, Eastern audiences seemed to like this movie a lot. It set records in the box offices of China. While I cannot deny the success of this film and the potential visual appeal, I feel the story is lacking and the characters were not fleshed out well at all."
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"One of the best films about the lives four upper middle class young women in the new Shanghai of our time.Beautiful cinematography. An honest look at the sex and city/gossip girl version of the most powerful/sexy city of China currently (soon to be most powerful city in the world), Shanghai. Shanghai is not NYC, it has more innocence, it's poorer, but also richer. Shanghai girls are more naive, yet more mature...The film may lack soul, or depth for some...but in a ""girl's world"", living in the ""comestic"" world of appearances has depth just so. In the moment of appearance has an exquisite feeling of it's own.This movie isn't for everyone, just like Twilight some may hate it, for many others will fall in love with this unpolitically correct, one dimensional aspirational lives of Shanghai girls."
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"Being a Chinese myself, I loved this film. I didn't expect it to be in American cinemas, so I understand that why the rating is so low- not everyone can understand this movie, especially when western people know very little about us, and the translation can bad, i know, but it was pretty good in Chinese. People in the theater cried and laughed... It could have been a little bit too luxury, I admit, but I loved the friendship, the love and all the other stuff that's really quite emotional to me. It did not have a happy ending, if you have read the 3rd book(which will probably not be filmed because of the characters)I loved those girls, especially Lily who seems to have cold heart, but is a dependent and loving young lady deep inside, and she has skills so she is not just a super rich girl that only spends her dad's money. This is more than those teen American films, it's deeper."
小时代,Tiny Times (2013),,2013,2013.6.27,"I was curious about this movie because despite of its success in China, there is a very low ratings and very harsh critics on internet. I wanted to watch it by curiosity at first, and I am surprised to be caught liking this movie ! In my humble opinion (F,25years old,France) nobody would expect anything from this movie according to its ratings. so I think many people will be surprised by this movie ! it have the ""drama"" print. My first impression comes from the quality of images and filming. Specially in Tiny times 2, there are beautiful scenes and songs. The story is about humans relations, centered on the friendship of 4 women. it's a novel like movie. but behind that common story, there are interesting characters that I got attached to.I couldn't resist to watch the Tiny Times 2 after I saw the first one. Although I still don't understand what makes me quite addicted to it, I would just recommend you to give it a try, specially the female public."

Maybe the story line is not satisfied for someone with not enough twist and turns but its simplicity is what i love about this movie. This movie reminds me and shows me the beauty of youth, friendship and love. Plus, those reviews saying the acting are bad, i love their acting, they are excellent and deliver well the characters from the novels. Extra credits for the pretty actors/ actresses. Great filming and editing, and amazing soundtrack too. Simple the movie it is, the magic of filming and movie editing really made the movie shiny and wonderful. I watched the first 2 movies of the sequel the other night and i cried my eyes out, i was so touched of their friendship. Absolutely recommend for someone looking for a simple and gentle movie."

The film is well acted and photographed.....I enjoyed the absence of graphics and effects so prevalent in current blockbusters....much preferring a good storyline - and this film provided it. About a pair of young lovers who agree to break up for 5 years to weigh how life takes them with a promise to meet in 5 years later and if both are still single to marry. There are a couple of twists which I didn't entirely foresee and the acting is excellent. I have to admit that I did shed a few tears as it touched me. No spoilers here ....so if you want good film - definitely one I'd recommend.
分手合约,A Wedding Invitation (2013),,2013,2013.4.12,Movie kick off with lot of funs and interesting jokes and slowly move into the romance and the directors link up evey parts of the story at the end. New twist with contemporary love story. Great entertaining movie!
分手合约,A Wedding Invitation (2013),,2013,2013.4.12,"It is just so beautiful. I should watch this movie earlier, but it is 2018 and I regret a lot that I never know about this movie before. Really captures the feeling of being in love. First love, loyalty, so dramatic and lovely."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Like John Woo's 'The Crossing', Tsui Hark's 'The Taking of Tiger Mountain' is set during the Civil War in the late 1940s; but instead of depicting the struggle between the People's Liberation Army and the Nationalists, Tsui and his four other screenwriters pit a certain Unit 203 of the PLA against a band of ruthless bandits whose stronghold is located high up in the snowy Tiger Mountain. Key to the PLA's strategy was a certain Yang Zirong, who infiltrated the bandits' stronghold and provided vital information which enabled his unit to triumph guerrilla-style against their more numerous and more well-equipped enemies.No matter that he has been made to look like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, Zhang Hanyu commands every single moment he is on screen as Zirong with a compelling performance of nuance and gravitas. While Lin Gengxin plays the righteous leader of Unit 203 Shao Jianbo with conviction and Tony Leung Kar-Fai is suitably hammy as the bandits' leader Lord Hawk, it is Zhang who truly owns the entire film, and it is no coincidence that his character is the most fully formed one of a movie which sometimes struggles to find the right balance of tone between fiction and history.That is perhaps inevitable given the slightly uneasy fit between material and filmmaker. Much as Tsui Hark is no stranger to epics, he isn't exactly the sort of filmmaker who tells a straightforward historical tale – even his arguably most popular 'Once Upon A Time in China' trilogy about the legendary folk hero Wong Fei Hung was embellished with his penchant for the theatrical. And so it is with his latest, which depicts the heroism of the 203 Unit with the sort of self-serious posture which historical accounts typically adopt but the loutishness of the bandits with the sort of eccentricity that made his fantasy epics such as 'The Legend of Zu' and the more recent 'Detective Dee' enjoyable flights of fancy.Amidst the tonal shifts, Zhang more than holds his own as Tsui's protagonist, an enigmatic stranger who joins the 203 with the medical officer Bai Ru (Tong Liya) and is at first met with doubt and scepticism by Jianbo. It is Zirong who comes up with the plan for him to go undercover by bringing to Lord Hawk a much coveted map with the locations of treasure left by the fleeing Japanese at the end of the Sino-Japanese war, and also to his quick-witted credit that he manages to win the trust of Lord Hawk to be sworn in as one of the league of brothers.It is a shaky one though – not only is he tested from within by his Second Brother (Yu Xing) who stages a mock invasion by the PLA and Lord Hawk's woman Qinglian (Yu Nan) who is under orders to try to seduce him, Zirong's identity is also threatened when a spy planted by the bandits within the villagers escapes after a failed attack by the former on the PLA soldiers protecting the latter. Such moments of genuine tension are perfectly positioned to keep the narrative taut, which largely unfolds as a buildup to the storming of the bandits' fortress on the eve of New Year's Eve on the occasion of Lord Hawk's birthday.Quite unlike the typical Tsui Hark movie therefore, this one has clearly fewer setpieces; indeed, we count just three – the first encounter between the PLA 203 Unit and the bandits at an abandoned warehouse; the failed attack led by Fifth and Sixth Brother on the village protected by the same unit; and finally the incursion of Lord Hawk's bastion to annihilate his reign of tyranny once and for all. Nonetheless, apart from some gimmicky slo-mo shots meant to justify the price of 3D for those who paid to see it with the additional dimension, these setpieces unfold with the scale and spectacle that one would expect from Tsui, the latter two in particular pop with thrill and imagination using a combination of old-school stunt staging and some nifty modern day CG effects.Not quite so successful is Tsui's attempt to capture the poignancy of the historical event – besides Zirong, the rest of the PLA heroes are portrayed with as much dimension as a propaganda film commissioned by the Chinese government itself, especially when their enemies are cast as their complete opposites. A sub-plot based upon the reunion of mother and son – the latter a young boy named Knotti the 203 Unit rescues and the former who turns out to be Qinglian – is too manipulative to be persuasive, even more so when it is used to bookend the narrative with a prologue and a coda set in 2015.Notwithstanding Tsui's autobiographical intent, the nexus that Tsui draws with present day is stretched most tenuously with an utterly unnecessary alternate ending that sees the Wolverine-lookalike Zirong turn into the very superhero by trying to rescue Qinglian from a twin-propeller plane that Lord Hawk is trying to take off in from a private airstrip in the mountain. As far as analogies go, this is a perfect example of the Chinese saying 'draw snake add feet' – so much so that its inclusion almost takes way what legitimacy Tsui had tried to build into the story in the first place.As probably his first historical epic, 'The Taking of Tiger Mountain' sees Tsui Hark struggle to find the right balance between reality and myth. Tsui's best films have been those which have allowed him to express his own inner eccentricities, but which prove out of place in a straightforward recount like this. The narrative flaws are all too obvious at the start and at the end, but thankfully, as far as the titular tale is concerned, Tsui has fashioned a gripping story of espionage that does history justice."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Positive: Good CGI, enough to make it a barely believable background and action scenes, but not great. Loosely based (meaning embellished for entertainment purposes) on post WWII varying factions vying for power in China as Japanese occupiers were being driven out. Neutral: Interesting tie in with contemporary descendant revisiting and re-imagining that period. Acting, dialogue, script, filming, all acceptable and pretty standard, straightforward, but nothing jumps out as being incredible. It almost felt as if it was a Communist Party sponsored politically correct promotional film. Rather than being a serious historical docudrama it seemed more like a lighthearted fantasy story. Negative: If looking for historical accuracy, then other than someone infiltrating a gang to spy with some sort of positive outcome for his efforts, it came across as an imaginative fantasy which may be all that a viewer is interested in. Misleading cover art."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Every December, in the China mainland, is the protective month for Chinese productions in local multiplexes, practically all the foreign tent-poles are pushed back and it is also the most profitable period for this vastly booming market. This year, the two main contenders are GONE WITH THE BULLETS (2014), Wen Jiang's much-hyped follow-up to the massively successful LET THE BULLETS FLY (2010, 8/10) and this Hark Tsui's latest offer of a 3D spectacle retelling a legendary battle during the period of Chinese Civil war. Nevertheless the former receives some unexpected backlash from critics and audience, which prompts me to pick the latter, plus I am bringing my parents, who will feel more related to the story since they know the original tale very well. Much exceeding my expectation, this is by far the most amazing 3D Chinese film I have ever watched in the theater, breathtakingly sets out the vast North East snowfield where the story unfolds, without compromising the luminance of the screen. Despite that the film starts with a modern-day prologue in New York, which inconveniently enforces a weird sense of incongruity with the main event, the first impression is pretty awesome, however, this subplot will continue to distract viewers out of the picture every so often and largely banks on heart-throb Gen Han's presence. The story takes place in 1947, a Communist detachment named 203 lead by Jianbo (Kenny Lin) fights against the bandit chieftain Cinereous Vulture (Leung), who takes over the Tiger Mountain with his eight warriors and thousands of bandits, plus heavy arms left by Japanese after the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945), including artilleries, cannons and a tank. Hogging the vantage point, they constantly attacks the villages nearby and becomes a major threat in the turf. Whereas the detachment has only 30 soldiers altogether with much lighter weaponry. There is only one way to win this battle against heavy odds, to circumvent the head-on confrontation and outwit the enemy by an audacious sneak attack. So Zirong Yang (Hanyu Zhang), a singular soldier, proposes an undercover scheme, he volunteers to infiltrate into the gang and look for a weak link in their defense system, so they can capture them all at one swoop. The mission is an adventurous one full of pitfalls and any small slip will cost Yang's life, Hanyu Zhang embodies this lone hero bravura with enthralling excitement and poise, confidently delivers bandit's cant and liberates his masculine charisma as a military man. Hong Kong veteran Tony Ka Fai Leung, almost unrecognizable here as the villain, easily stands out with his flashy and distinctive outfits, so is his eight warriors, all have been upgraded with eye-popping apparel and apparatuses. By contrast, the Communist soldiers are far more plain and conventional. Kenny Lin outstrips his youthful greenness, strenuously leaves an impression of being mature and serious. With six screenwriters credited, they enrich the film with adequate suspense, sporadic humor, the routine sacrifice and female presence (e.g. Nan Yu owns her dramatic outburst in a crudely sketched characterization). Hark Tsui has ventured into 3D technology since two DETECTIVE DEE films and the dismaying FLYING SWORDS OF DRAGON GATE (2011, 3/10), so finally he reaches the benchmark with this one, along with the dashing bullets and grenades slo-motion, he also schemes a prolonged alternative ending after the credits, just to show that now the industrial special effects craftsmanship is no interior compared with the Hollywood criterion. One can grudge about the final coup de main is way too easy to accomplish, but for anyone who is familiar with the current status of Chinese cinema, it is a good relief we can dish up such an entertaining blockbuster independently, and its box-office prospect is quite promising too, a sure-fire to reach a career-high for the maestro Hark after 35 years in the line."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"A rollicking, ridiculous action movie. Heroic, crazed and great fun. Not to be taken seriously in any way. The second ending is way more fun. Stay the distance. A Tiger's tail/tale."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Tsui Hark movies are always a mixed bag for me. The Vietnamese New Wave director created visually stunning, profoundly philosophical and mostly historically inspired movies like the ''A Chinese Ghost Story'' and ''Once Upon a Time in China'' movie series in his early years that any movie fan should know. In recent years, he rather focused on commercially entertaining, effect-ridden and overall meaningless films such as ''Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame'' and ''The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate''. The latter movies weren't entirely bad but they weren't on the same artistic, authentic and intellectual level as his early classics. ''The Taking of Tiger Mountain'' is situated somewhere in between both categories but probably closer to the second group than to the first.On the positive side, the movie is partially historically inspired even though the film isn't devoid of a certain propagandistic approach that presents the People's Liberation Army in a much too positive way. The movie basically tells the story of a small group within this army that needs to outsmart a large group of bandits that are raiding villages in the northern parts of the fragile country. The settings of the movie are truly spectacular. The costumes, the villages and even the way the actors speak are truly accurate and trace your way back seventy years in time. Most of the story is set in elegant winter landscapes and one gets to see breathtaking valleys and mountains, simple but charming skiing exercises and even a couple of animals such as the tiger that attacks the protagonist halfway through the movie. In comparison with Tsui Hark's other recent movies, especially the first half of the film feels refreshingly authentic, natural and realistic and only a few effects are used in an efficient way. Towards the climax of the story, more and more special effects are used but they somehow add to the action and tension of the film and don't feel randomly inserted as in many of his other recent films. The action choreographies are stunning and the best example for these intense passages is the battle in the raided village which takes place towards the last third of the movie. While the acting itself is not outstanding, it definitely has more depth than characters in Tsui Hark's more recent films and one can feel some empathy with the smart and mysterious protagonist, the emotional and lonely child or the optimistic female combat medic.On the negative side, the main villain remains superficial and even ridiculous at certain moments. The short moments of humour when he speaks nonsense or exaggeration when he gestures in theatrical manner feel out of place and unnecessarily decrease the intensity of the movie. The special effects get a little bit exaggerated in the final twenty minutes or so of the movie and contrast the initially authentic magic of the movie that turns into something which isn't a far call from a meaningless Hollywood action flick. The story itself is also a little bit too simple, predictable and one-sided. Another element which I disliked is how the movie was forcedly connected to some random Chinese emigrant living in New York City who can't let go of his culture, family and past instead of trying to become accurately integrated in a foreign country. I feel that this connection to our contemporary world didn't add anything at all to the movie even if the director probably intended to prove that the value of this story based on Qu Bo's novel of the same name from 1957 has been firmly planted in the Chinese national consciousness for more than half a century.In the end, the numerous positive elements are much more impressive and present than the few negative facts which can be seen as secondary. Tsui Hark somewhat redeems himself after a series of rather shallow flicks that were only aiming for commercial success, modern special effects and simple entertainment. This movie has more depth concerning the characters, magic settings and at least some kind of moral at certain points in the story. This movie still isn't on the same level as Tsui Hark's earliest successes but fans of historically inspired contemporary Chinese action movies can't go wrong with this movie and should therefore give this film a chance."

智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Very interesting action adventure with some impressive camera work. The action sequences are amazing and the film is totally unpredictable. The tiger scene was incredible! I loved the film, effects, story and music. Very well done."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"The Taking of Tiger Mountain is an epic action movie directed by Tsui Hark and stars Zhang Hanyu, Lin Gengxin, Tony Leung Ka-fai, Yu Nan and Tong Liya.I haven't read or heard about the incident on which the movie is made so i'll not get into the debate of how close the movie is to reality but will only review on the basis of watching a movie.The movie is a decently entertaining movie and the movie has it's flaws as well as it's strength and overall the movie is good one time watch movie.The acting in the movie is good and Zhang Hanyu had done a tremendous job and is the most shining among them all, Lin Gengxin was impressive, Tony Leung Ka-fai had a strong role of The Hawk and was effective. Rest of the support staff were either superb or decent.Screenplay of the movie is fairly decent but the continuity pace is missing from the movie and sometimes the movie looks slow however it will not loose the grip from the viewers, the length of the movie could've been trimmed a little to make the movie more gripping. The movie is said to be a war movie but war scenes are very limited.The fighting scenes of the movie is good but doesn't looks convincing and looked unnatural, the climax of the movie seems to be shot in a hurry as i was expecting some decent war but the movie ends quickly.Some of the scenes were shot beautifully such as the fight with the tiger. Overall the movie is decently entertaining, the war movie lovers might be disappointed with limited war scenes, The movie is a decently one time watch movie."
智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"About a 2D viewing.This is very clearly produced under Party sponsorship to celebrate the soldiers who won the country. The contrast with US WWII films is striking. We require tough heroes, where here there is something more noble. Two remarkable things... The film has an odd framing device that one can only imagine was dreamed up by a Party official. A modern Chinese youngster is off to Silicon Valley as a sort of genius. He watches on an iPhone an old movie of this event, apparently staged by the Peking Opera. In between, we have this film. At the end, we discover that he owes his existence to this and by implication his education and opportunity. The time is set right after the collapse of the Japanese occupation. Warlords have seized the armaments and sustenance and for the People's Republic to succeed, ragtag groups must prevail. (No mention of the official government.)The strange thing is that though produced by Chinese, it is thoroughly Japanese. Kurosawan to be precise. The filmmaker remarks on this in a fun way: the movie is over, having presented the 'real' story. Then our young modern kid imagines an alternative ending, and it is thoroughly Indiana Jones. Incidentally, the stunts and effects are pretty ordinary except for a sequence with a tiger. This was amazing. Had to be real."

智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy 3D directed by Tsui Hark has been released in mainland long ago, while it is going to be released in Hong Kong on May14th.Reproducing a model opera of the Cultural Revolution, the skilled are bold.The movie began with ""New York 2015"" and I supposed I had come to the wrong cinema. It turns out that it had something to do with Tsui Hark's affection, that he first got to know the Beijing opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy in New York, therefore, the movie is arranged with some foreign citizens of Chinese origin singing karaoke and the television mistakenly showed Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy, on the screen a person asked contemptuously, ""What's that?"" Actually, the movie had been playing nice. If it comes into reality, the person must have yelled out loudly.Tsui Hark was very clear about this of course, so I was wondering how he would reverse negative impression of those people (exactly we audiences) on Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy—strong political complexion,old-fashion and out of date.Tsui Hark chose 3D.But 3D is not a panacea. Ring 3D in Japan suffered a crushing failure.Bullet passing through slowly and stop in a moment, then the scene circling back have been applied in Matrix in 1999. The 3D of Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy would not make any better. When ravens were flying over indoors, I could not help laughing out, for it was too similar to the owls in Harry Porter series.By the way, I could not recognize Tony Leung who acted as a bandit ""Hawk"". But wearing a fake nose is actually again a copy from Nicole Kidman in The Hours.In the end, I found it was only my own wishful thinking that Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy 3D would make a breakthrough apart from 3D. I can accept the protagonist is National Liberation Army and the dialogues are full of northeast dialect, but I cannot accept the movie ""sticks to the original"" to consecrate characters to serve politics. On the side of the protagonist, even girls and little children were loyal and courageous, having excellent marksmanship and extraordinary skills. They could catch a bandit standing guard on high by throwing up a rope; and the protagonist could fly to a snow mountain of thousands meter high by a rope.It is really not worshiping and having blind faith in foreign things. James Bond has extraordinary skills, but he can manages to make the impossible possible, to make me believe, make me stop querying and engage to movie world. Furthermore, though he has extraordinary skills, James Bond has his weakness, which makes him more human."

智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"At the first glance (at the movie poster), this is definitely not the usual film that many people would catch. However, before the film was aired in Singapore, I've seen many positive review circulating online. Thanks to Clover Films, I got to watch this film directed by Tsui Hark, the director who filmed most of my favourite childhood Wong Fei Hong films starring Vincent Zhao and Jet Li.While this film was adapted from a 1957 novel, a famous opera, as well as a real life story, I thought the story was a tad too dramatic, not that I didn't like it, Lin Gengxin was almost a Captain America in the film with his leadership quality, and Chen Xiao (the recent Yang Guo in the New Condor Hero) as one of the be-spectacled Harry Potter-lookalike Gao Bo was like Bucky Barnes, Steve Roger's best friend.What I like about this film was how they made use of many popular actors and dressed them up in a such a way where they were almost not recognizable, unless you are their super fans. Chen Xiao and Tony Leung as Lord Hawk was one of the many examples.While fans of these famous opera will love this adaptation, people who do not know about it might find the film over the top, with tanks, bombs and jet planes hidden in the Tiger Mountain.

智取威虎山,The Taking of Tiger Mountain (2014),,2014,2014.12.23,"The best scene for me is the tiger attack, matches by the skills of Zhang. I rewatch it a few times, and begin to notice some 'unlikelihoods'. Even if the camara shots are breathtaking, the riffle of Zhang is a mechanism action, so you have to reload after each shot even if the chamber contains 5 cartridges (like a Muser use in WW2). During the tiger last jump, Zhang load a cartridge but fire 4 bullets, without using the action 'mechanism' ...like an automatic riffle. Zhang can go up and down the tree like an acrobat, sometimes, without even using his legs, but the tiger in unable to climb with his powerful claws. The size of the dead tiger lying on Zhang is quite exagerated... But this is OK from a cinematographic marketing. For the rest of the movie, it will be a lot greater if you keep it simple Mr Director, I mean without the theatricals and too much makeup :)"
匆匆那年,Fleet of Time (2014),,2014,2014.12.4,"This is the third time I see a Chinese movie, but I find a very low ratings here... Why? Idk but what I know is this movie is very touching, with much of warmfeelings and nostalgia.It's realistic, not romenticising relationships, but views it from a deep view, it explains promises, especially the ones we give when we are in the moment of passion.. I've just finished it so I'm speechless.. must watch"
微爱之渐入佳境,Love on the Cloud (2014),,2014,2014.12.24,"At first I suspected whether or not this was a serious movie. It was different and somewhat ludicrous. Maybe it was just for comedy but no. It is not. It is more than a comedy. It gives chills at the moments of realization.Acting at the beginning seemed somewhat ridiculous but later I appreciated it. It is suitable for the style of the move even though time to time I saw bad acting too.The movie is quite striking when you realize it represent something bigger than itself. We see one of the world's most densely populated cities: Beijing. In Beijing we focus on 'three dreamers' among millions of other dreamers. They come close to realize their dreams and at the end they were promised money and fame. They thought everything was going to be better. They work hard and they hoped for the better. Artistic features were not these three dreamers priority over money from the beginning but even their flexibility on their artistic values –if there is any- would be tested. Obviously they were doing all these for money. While the promised money amount is increased the restraints and requirements also increased. As a last nail, while the promised money was at its peak, they were required to revise the script again and to afford the requirements they were to make ridiculous changes on the script. At this point even the writer was had revolting feelings. But still they had no principles when it comes to money. They accepted to do the revisions even though it was ridiculous and humiliating. While they were working hard on the script the protagonist learns he and his actor friend was out of the project. This reminds us, in the world that we live in people and their dreams are insignificant. Their hopes and their hard work are also insignificant. These three dreamers were ultimately just tools for making or bringing money. But now two of them were out. They were one of the millions of people who had dreams. Now they are in this crowd again.The sceneries chosen –the big scary buildings, the Beijing traffic- give the idea of crowded city even though our focus on just three tiny people.While the movie contains this kind of serious matters it always mock itself by suddenly moving into unlikely things which brings a smile on your face. One second the protagonist very romantically confesses to the girl –under the disguise of reading the script- and then after the actor turns into a werewolf. That's why I can say that movie successfully over comes the challenge of containing some serious matters and also in overall being fun.After the friend of the scriptwriter, the actor one, finds money for them to freely write and play. The atmosphere suddenly changes. The whole movie becomes happier. We see sunny weathers, light colors and a lot of happy smiles.In this vast city and among this mass people the protagonist has very few who are dear to him. But at the end no one is around him. Some are willingly leave the writer some cannot help the situation and have to leave. Maybe just one dog still stays with him.In summary, 'Love on the Cloud' is a unique movie that storms up your feelings. The movie has so many sweet nuances, watch it and see it for yourself!"
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"Lost in Hong Kong was put together quite well for maximum enjoyment. I found it funny, action packed, touching and beautiful all at the same time.I'll be honest, when it comes to Asian cinema I'm more about Kung Fu flicks than anything else. I knew this was more of a comedy and I went into it thinking I might not get it, but after seeing the crime drama, Saving Mr. Wu, and loving that, this movie was recommended. So I gave it a try. The story they tell is pretty universal. Xu Lai, is a man facing a midlife crisis added by the stress of trying to get his wife pregnant. When an opportunity comes to relive his youth with his first love, he travels all over Hong Kong in an attempt to rekindle the relationship, only to find the task more difficult when his Brother-In-Law tags along in order to document his life. Plus they both become evolved with a murder investigation. I love it when movies defy genres and are able to mix in a lot of things to the story elements without being too jumbled and this movie does that very creatively. I don't know if this would be considered China's version of a blockbuster but it works on that level.The movie has everything, everyone would need in order to stay in the seats and keep watching. Most of all, I love how beautiful the cinematography made Hong Kong look. It adds to the personality of the whole film.I definitely recommend giving it a look. it's got action adventure, Romance, and especially comedy. It's a good one."
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"I had high hopes for this movie as I settled into my flight (economy class as I can't afford business) to watch this modern day HK movie. I don't know that the HK movie industry is like these days.One tiresome aspect in Lost in Hong Kong is the overdoing of the helmet or whatever on the lead character Xu Lai during critical moments. Funny at first, but some tighter editing would have helped to get the movie moving along and for less frustration for the audience. I wonder what the producers have next in store...perhaps Lost in Auckland or Lost in Pittsburgh. Still, I would watch Lost on Hong Kong, as I would probably appreciate it a second time around. I'd definitely buy the DVD if there was a director's or actor's commentary."
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"OK , Maybe 9/10 is too high but the average needs to go up.I found this on blu-ray at my local library (!) and one look at the title caught my attention. I hadn't seen any HK type comedies in a long time so I thought this deserved a chance.Funny, zany and somewhat scatological in it's humor with a healthy dose of thrills, sentiment and general silliness in the Chow manor, this picture was a pleasant surprise and I found it entertaining to watch. While it is Chinese humor it does translate (maybe not verbally) to those who appreciate comedy. The subtitles come fast and furious to the Western eye but the action speaks for itself.My only complaint was the excruciatingly long climax to the film, but the CGI was spectacular.So, A HK comedy made n HK by mainland artists. Recommended."
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"This film is just so embarrassing to watch. It seems that after Stephen Chow's ""Clueless"" genre that almost ruined the Hong Kong movie industries, Zheng Xu, a guy who inherited the similar ingredients from Mr. Chow, is trying so hard to ruin the Chinese Mainland China's movie industries again. Yes, both guys at first have glorified the box office everywhere in the Chinese territories, but it's not a good thing to see Xu to further ridicule the Chinese viewers' standard to an even lower level. What a series of farces he did to the Chinese film trend. Now, lot of the copycatting wannabes are trying to overdo what he did, making the movies, the screenplays, the scenarios, the plots and acting more and more ridiculously stupid and awkward to watch. All the unrealistic, exaggerated, pretentious, clown-jerk like performances in these kind of movies, they call ""acting"". All the stupid scenarios and plots of what Mr.Xu crazily and illogically put together in his recent films, people deemed them as genius or ingeniously crafted. But once this kind of screenplay and its genre become a formatted formula, farce would take place, the definition of ""Comedy"" would be interpreted and equal with ""Farce"". There will be no way back to normal, the fine line that define ""comedy"", ""thriller"", ""drama"", ""action"" would be all confined into one narrow definition: ""FARCE"". Then the doomsday of the Chinese movie industries will come. Movie viewers' taste would be totally ruined and lowered to a limbo that only low I.Q. mature morons or immature teen-ages would and could keep the loyalty of such farce.Why ""farce"" would ruin everything? Because you can put every stupid scenario, plot, story in a screenplay, no matter how ridiculous and how illogical it might be, and all the exaggerated, unnatural performances of those actors who signed up doing it will be accepted as ""good and talented"" ACTING. As long as you could make those retarded viewers laugh uncontrollably, the movie would be rated ""good"" and ""fun to watch"", but actually they are just short lived mess on the screen.The Chinese movie people are anxious to show to the westerners how they are also understanding what ""Humor"" means, they desperately want to show those non-Chinese movie viewers how they understand the ""Sense of Humor"". But by doing so, only shows their misunderstanding and their shallowness almost to anything and everything.Please, Mr. Xu, don't do this kinda crap again and again. There are ways to achieve great Box Office record and to make the money, but this definitely not one of them."
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"Bo Cai's family and especially Lala are obnoxious to an intolerable degree, and Xu Lai's polite and benign attitude toward them and refraining from violence toward Lala is actually frustrating for the viewer. The plot doesn't make too much sense. Situations mildly funny. If it were half as long maybe could be mediocre rather than bad."
港囧,Lost in Hong Kong (2015),,2015,2015.09.25,"It would be too bad if we went to the cinema to give people their heads. About the whole way. All kinds of unlimited sections of bridges can not play a funny role at all. Exaggerated acting style, distorted the plot of the three views, perhaps the meaning of this film is to reproduce all kinds of Hong Kong movies, bridges, and play a few old songs."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"I am not sure what some of the critics and spoilers of the COTGF story were expecting... I agree with the comparisons of Shakespearan tragedies and royal family intrigues, and the reference to dysfunctional families and meltdowns. Actually, I was thinking a lot about the Lion in Winter transported in a Chinese setting. In the English drama, the King simply has the Queen imprisoned for her political rebellion. In this movie, the Emperor decides to slowly poison the Empress because of her affair with his oldest son. Both lead characters have their reasons for sticking to their planned course of action. Also, I was reminded about the Borgias and some of the other Italian, French and Greek royal dramas when emotions get totally out of hand. Why do some viewers say that emotions are over the top or that the females are too scantily clad? This movie shows that Chinese characters can have very powerful human emotions: sexual attraction,lust, filial love, greed, ambition... just like any other people in the world.And yes, the Chinese Imperial Palace is displayed on an extravagantly grand scale just because it is possible to do it only in China! China has more people than any other country and can afford the larger than life scenes in opulent settings.The Emperor is at first shown as a kind father who wants to maintain a harmonious balance of family and state. Ultimately, we find out that he is a hypocritical megalomaniac who obliterated his first wife's family in his bid to become Emperor and will not allow anyone to cross his will in his kingdom. Interestingly, even for a blood thirsty dictator, he has his soft spot, and that is his love for his first born son, who means well but appears rather weak of morals.The acting is very powerful: the epitome of Chinese acting is in the facial expressions within a restrained and mechanical setting (see Chinese opera) and both Gong Li and Cho Yung Fat do a great job in their roles. Watch the eyes and the hands... The occasional outbursts of real emotion when the character is pushed beyond its limits: see the Empress when she occasionally cannot help herself and tries to seduce the Crown Prince as a woman; see the Emperor when he toys with the Empress and shows her his kindness in prescribing herbal potions and her defiant reply makes him toss his arm in frustration; the final eruption of the despot when the youngest prince dares to rear up with hate...I wonder if any dysfunctional family that lives with a totally controlling father and experiences his insane fits of punishment can relate with the control and violence shown at the end. He tolerates the Empress because she is a princess and very decorative and the mother of his 2 younger sons, and he even tolerated silently her affair for a while, but he will not tolerate her efforts to usurp him publicly. I can predict that the Empress will die a slow and humiliating death unless she finds a way to kill herself first.What I picked up very clearly is the subtle form of psychological cruelty that underlies the Chinese concept of revenge. Many long-standing cultures understand this form of torture very well which goes above and beyond killing a person. Think about the movie Jean De La Florette where the protagonist is slowly killed by the grinding labor of finding non-existing water. It is the slowly grinding down of a person's will through day-in and day-out abuse. See the daily poisoning of the Empress under the guise of caring for her health. See the impossible ending offer to the rebellious prince to choose between killing his own mother with regular offering of the herbal potion versus death under his father's hand - the prince decides to end his life to get out of this insane set of situation. He actually succeeds in comparison to the eldest prince who tries suicide the previous evening and fails to slice his own throat.Yes, the Emperor is ultimately an evil man because he sacrifices all that he loves for his political ambition to be the boss, but he has his human dimensions: he is attracted as a man to the 2 women he loves most in his life, as seen in their rare intimate moments together and he loves the first son unconditionally... Personally, I think that the characters are very well developed because they are complex, obsessed and quite multi-dimensional in their basic human drives. They make sense within the constraints in which they are cast."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"10th Century , during China's Tang dynasty the emperor has taken the princess of a neighboring province as wife. She has borne him two sons and raised his eldest . On the eve of the Chong Yang Festival, golden flowers fill the Imperial Palace. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) returns unexpectedly with his second son, Prince Jai (Jay Chou). His pretext is to celebrate the holiday with his family, but given the chilled relations between the Emperor and the ailing Empress (Gong Li), this seems disingenuous . The control of emperor over his dominion is complete, including the royal family itself . For many years, the Empress and Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), her stepson, have had an illicit liaison and unspeakable secrets are hidden within the Forbidden City. Feeling trapped, Prince Wan dreams of escaping the palace with his secret love Chan (Li Man), the Imperial Doctor's daughter. Meanwhile, Prince Jai, the faithful son, grows worried over the Empress's health and her obsession with golden chrysanthemums. The Emperor harbors equally clandestine plans; the Imperial Doctor (Ni Dahong) is the only one privy to his machinations. When the Emperor senses a looming threat, the emperor relocates the medic's family from the Palace to a remote area . While they are en route, mysterious assassins attack them. Chan and her mother, Jiang Shi (Chen Jin) are forced back to the palace. At the night, thousands of soldiers are trampled as blood spills across the Imperial Palace in a spectacular final battle .This luxurious epic film was marvelously filmed with impressive production design , colorful cinematography and breathtaking scenes . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with dark surprises , thrills , fierce combats and groundbreaking battles . Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios is developed a familiar intrigue in Shakespeare's King Lear style , including betrayal , incest , crime and exploring the dark side of Chinese empire . Impressive and rousing fights with thousands of golden armored warriors reenacted by lots of extras . Overwhelming attack on the fortress where is relocated the doctor's family , being subsequently copied in ¨Kung Fu Panda¨ . Wonderfully photographed especially when against a moonlit night, thousands of chrysanthemum blossoms are trampled as blood spills across the Imperial Palace. The motion picture was glamorously directed by Yimou Zhang who often works with the actress Li Gong and as well as most of his films , it begins with the title displayed in Chinese calligraphy style. Zhang forms part of China's Fifth Generation of filmmakers, who began making films after the Cultural Revolution , others from this group include Chen Kaige and Jinzhan Zhang . He is an expert on Chinese epics such as ¨Shanghai Triad¨ , ¨Hero¨ ,¨House of Flying Daggers¨ , ¨The flowers of war¨ and of course the Oscarized and successful ¨Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon¨ . Rating : Better than average . Worthwhile watching ."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Me and my girlfriend watched this in Guangzhou, China. It isn't exactly a feel-good movie..It's hard to describe what this film does, without spoiling the movie. And that structure is it's strength. Suffice to say, this is a very strongly woven movie, a movie where direction and production are the stars.And that is also ""Curse of the golden flower""'s weakness. This is, after all, a movie. Moviegoers are used to seeing the full spectrum of a movie; varied scenery and ambiance, multiple stories, realistic characters, a realistic society portrait, and so on. Certainly, this movie has strong characters, but like the imperial court setting, they are puppets. They never change their directions, they are forced to play the drama. Most of the action happens on the same 3-4 scenes, with the same characters. Like an opera; stereotypic, but intensely dramatic and glorious.That said, this movie had an effect on me, and as mentioned, it is very well crafted. Without a doubt, it shows Yimou Zhang's skills in his profession, and I do recommend it. But don't expect a ""movie"" in the classical sense, expect Greek tragedy or opera-style drama."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Curse of the Golden Flower's intrigue is very interesting and offer a complex story. The over- opulence is even easy to disregard, until the fighting begins. It's like applying fine white lace to a garment made of coarse unbleached wool. It's messy. All the refinements get lost very quickly.The visuals are very poignant, the acting is good for the most part, and the scenario quite enjoyable. Had they cut out all the fighting, it would have made a pretty good movie. I would definitively enjoyed it more.However, if you're a fan of Asian style wire fighting, impossible odds, beyond measure heroes in action, then you'll have no problem enjoying this fine film. If not, then patiently sit through the battles and wait for the conclusion for closure."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Zhang Yimou was a very highly regarded filmmaker 5 years ago, before I had ever heard of him. Then he earned a place in my heart by directing both Hero and House of Flying Daggers. With those last two I felt like I was in martial arts movie heaven, so I would instantly be interested in any other future films that could approach those two in scope, talent, and action. Curse of the Golden Flower focuses mostly on the first two of those three traits, but besides, anything starring Chow Yun-Fat will earn my attention like a bullet to the head. I do own The Corrupter after all.This is a film about a royal family, rather dysfunctional at that, in the 928 AD Tang Dynasty. Chow Yun-Fat is Emperor Ping, who from the way he handles his family and can anticipate any kind of attack or counterattack seems like quite the ruthless warlord. He has three sons: one is a teenager, who isn't given much regard but knows more than others think. The eldest of the three is the current crown prince, but doesn't seem to have any special talents, other than drawing the affections of the wrong women. The middle son is a great warrior and, of course, is now the favorite of the father. But these characters may be just pawns to Empress Phoenix (Gong Li), who is mother to the younger two brothers and step-mother to the eldest. Under normal circumstances she might be a great mother, wife, and Empress, but current circumstances, including a mystery illness, have forced her to take actions involving a secret plot to remove her husband from the throne.This is not the action movie some might expect, though there is enough near the end to earn the R rating. It's basically a family drama, though in a rather fascinating and different setting for such a story. As you'd expect with a royal family, appearances are everything. Anything out of the ordinary has to happen in secret. All the normal everyday stuff is almost mechanical in nature. Whether you see dozens of servants getting up in the morning, or preparing food, or planting flowers, it all occurs in such a fiercely coordinated fashion. It would have been such a hard life, either being a royal or supporting one, but it would be a miserable life if one couldn't take any pride in what they did.The filmmakers who designed and implemented all the sets and costumes should take a hell of a lot of pride in what they do. The family of this story, even while destroying themselves (and therefore their empire) from within, are living in the most lavish accommodations and outfits I've ever seen. I usually don't think much of costuming or set design, but I must say that after seeing Chow Yun-Fat's golden suit of armor, or anything Gong Li was in, or the design of their personal quarters, I really hope for some Oscar recognition. Perhaps the best I've ever seen in those areas.Overall though, a good film, and a definite must for any Chow Yun-Fat fan to seem him play such a great villain, as with Sammo Hung in Sha Po Lang. It kept me interested throughout, but nothing too surprising happened in regards to story. It basically all went how I imagined it would."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Just saw this film at a cinema near to my home in Wuhan China.I rated it very high because it is the first film in the last three years which can tell a story so smoothly. After the first Hollywood movie The Fugitive(lead actor Harrison Ford) was admitted in my country, the Chinese films changed forever by the affections of Hollywood movies. But the Chinese film makers did not know how to tell a story in the Hollywood way. Especially the film makers wanted to make BIG movie (the movie making cost high) to gain the high profit in the market, but in the same time they seemed like they forget how to tell a good story. But Chinese audience is very tolerable, they watch they comment and they despise. After all these years' BIG films' bombing, I watched a good story telling film, why should I not be satisfied?Disscusing this film in the technique way is not the important thing. All this years the BIG films all packed by the advanced techniques, but inside is a garbage.(sorry for the rude word, I can not say a better word for my poor English)Somebody (maybe a lot of foreign people) may want to watch more KongFu in Chinese films. But what I want to say is KongFu is not the only part of Chinese Culture, in fact it never was the major part of Chinese Culture in the past three thousand years. I can say it because I know our country and her history. The relationship and interaction of characters is the major part of film . This film is based on a novel Thunder Storm by Chao Yu in 40s of 20th century, and the background is changed to about 9th century.For the solid story by Chao Yu, the film is brilliant. And the success of this film is also a victory of Chinese writers. It proved that the real good novel can live all the time.Thank you for read this."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Despite the millions of chrysanthemum flowers, ten thousand soldiers and three prominent male cast (Chow Yun Fatt, Jay Chou and Liu Ye), one thing will capture your attention. Make that two.Gong Li and her titillating assets have almost overshadowed everything else in the movie. While it may not be historically accurate for 10th Century Tang Dynasty palace females to dress so scantily, director Zhang Yimou obviously wants to make a stylistic statement right from the opening scene.His play with colours was apparent from Hero. Curse of the Golden Flowers presents a kaleidoscope in its grandeur palace setting and elaborate costumes. The final fighting scene lead by Prince Jai (Jay Chou playing Jay?) the prince with golden armored warriors trampling over chrysanthemum is nothing short of impressive.Jay Chou had a difficult time playing Prince Jai, which required more complexity than a cool rider in Initial D. While emotional scenes with Gong Li drew some laughter from the audience, his final scene was noteworthy and articulation has improved.Kudos goes to Chow Yun Fatt and Gong Li. Chow has improved on his accent tremendously (which was very strange in Crouching Tiger) and portrayed the Emperor with magnitude and hysterical outrage. Look out for the scene as the usually mild mannered Chow punishes his son with both rising temper and hair.While the film obviously banks on Gong Li's bosoms, they shouldn't distract audience from her exceptional acting. It may be over-the-top at times, but she shows that nobody else can play this vengeful and solitary empress better than her. At this moment, she is the queen of the Chinese cinema.The story of betrayal, illicit affairs, chilled relations and dysfunctional families may be run on the mill and overdone. Drawing parallels with The Banquet by Zhang Ziyi is inevitable. Both are about an obsessed empress who craves for a relationship with the prince (Interestingly, both well-known for playing gay roles) and demands for more power from the emperor.Curse of the Golden Flower is not just soap drama but a period epic to impress with colours, opulence and sheer indulgence.http://themovieclub.blogspot.com"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"So many superlatives can be applied to CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER that it's difficult to assess the movie without sounding totally biased and over the top. Few films have achieved the level of sheer visual beauty as this one with its interior shots of Chinese palace walls and columns illuminated by glowing hues of gold, emerald, and ruby. Few also have managed to weave the threads of so many tangled tortured relationships into such a spellbinding masterpiece of tragedy.The seductive visual beauty of this film's set and costumes makes a powerful contrast to the deadly schemes and betrayals that motivate the leading characters, members of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 BC). Just as the viewer finds him- or herself starting to feel sorry for one character--for example the Empress who is being tortured by her husband, or the Emperor who has been scandalously betrayed by his wife--it turns out that nobody is 100 percent innocent, not even the youngest of the royal family's three sons. If there's one great exception to the royal family's collective guilt, it would be the second son, Prince Jai, played with nobility and charisma by Chinese pop star Jay Chou. Having proved himself on the battlefield as a worthy contender for the throne, Prince Jai returns home only to find himself agonizingly torn between loyalty to his mother and father. The sacrifice he makes in the end turns out to be the most brutal tragedy of all.Yun Fat Chow as the Emperor and Gong Li in the role of the Empress give incredible performances as a couple whose love has long died but who remain together for the sake of political convenience. Behind their beautiful clothes, lavish furnishings, and perfectly choreographed movements, the two calmly seek each others' destruction. Yun Fat Chow's and Li's performance are on par with that of the world's best Shakespearean actors and the story of CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER itself can be compared to a combination of ""King Lear"" and ""Oedipus Rex."" One begins to truly appreciate the challenges directors face when considering the titanic logistics director Zhang Yimou had to deal with in order to make this film. Imagine the precision of detail and control it took to go, as he does with the movie, from one scene of dozens of beautiful feudal-era women waking and preparing to work in the palace, to another later on of a thousand warriors in gold armor charging against another thousand warriors in metallic black. With its brilliant storyline, glorious production, and extraordinary performances, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER stands as a major triumph of modern film-making.by Aberjhani, author of ""The Bridge of Silver Wings"""
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"""Curse of the Golden Flower"" is probably the most lavish costume drama in history, equaling or outdoing director Zhang Yimou's other spectaculars, such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."" It's a sea of gold, red, blue, silver, with Yee Chung Man's improbably luxurious costumes. Armies clash, warriors fly, the imperial family self-destructs, and the Shakespearean plotting, feuding, and killing never stops. Also, in a likely surprise to cultural historians, ""Curse"" establishes 10th century China as the time and place for the perfection of the push-up bra. Although heaving bosoms are present throughout the movie, the opening scene is unequalled in its discreet Playboy fantasy of legions of young women getting ready for the arrival of the Emperor. It's spectacular and outlandish-funny at the same time, prompting simultaneous leering and laughing. The flamboyant Later Tang Dynasty (923-936 AD) is the subject of Zhang's film, the royal family giving ""dysfunctional"" a bad name. The Emperor (Chow Yun Fat) is a majestic, but thoroughly evil man, who oversees the systematic poisoning of the Empress (Gong Li, back with Zhang, the director who made her a star years ago before the two parted ways). The Empress, who eventually engineers the meltdown of the entire court, carries on an affair with her stepson, the Crown Prince (Liu Ye) who, in turn, sleeps with the beauteous Chan (Li Man), both blissfully - but not for long - unaware that they are closely related. Prince Jai (Jay Chou, in a great performance) is the middle son, aspiring to become the Crown Prince and then the Emperor (not necessarily in that order); Prince Yu (Qin Junjie) is the youngest son, not well positioned for the succession, but keep your eyes on him - he may just have a surprise coming. This is just a fraction of the what's going on in the Imperial Palace, but Zhang's genius as a director is proved once again. He is telling this complex, even convoluted story in such straightforward manner that it can be followed easily. Zhang, who is in New York right now, directing a Tan Dun world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera (having done Puccini's ""Turandot"" in Beijing), is the most operatic of film directors, with an epic sweep, flamboyance, gripping drama. (Speaking of the Zhang-Tan Dun partnership, which gave ""Hero"" a magnificent soundtrack, it's a shame that the composer for ""Curse"" is Shigeru Umebayashi, whose music is smaltzy and unoriginal.) Zhang quotes an old Chinese saying, ""Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside,"" and ""Curse"" has it all, although the gold-and-jade surface is so ostentatiously brilliant that all that portentous stuff within lacks depth and believability. At some of the most dramatic moments, there is laughter in the audience: the fun is too much to bother with what's supposed to be hot and heavy, the intended drama turns into melodrama. But, again, the fun is great and nonstop; bosoms may well heave merrily in the seats as well as they do, dramatically, on the screen."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film with special personal appearances by Zhang Yimou and Gong Li... I have to say I was blown away by it! I was not expecting a story with such depth...The cinematography, the art direction, and the sheer enormity of the visuals were staggering. Great sword work... exquisite wire sequences... and HUGE battles - but all done with an intensity that's stunning. And even more, the acting was superb - Chow Yung Fat is a master, and his scenes together with Gong Li are beautifully emotional. Gong Li is more beautiful than ever in a role that demands huge range from the first scene and never lets up... She does her best work ever! I have nothing but praise for this film. I can't wait to see it again."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"This is a highly charged docudrama epic, instead of the gladiator/hero-ish action flick its marketing led people to believe. With that said, this is a very gripping film, almost to the point of eerie realism, for those of us who are familiar with ancient royal family politics. Betrayal, back-stabbing, assassination, adultery, family tragedy,... everything that could go wrong in the the royal court happened, and were woven in a way that made the complicated plot that much more involving. More than once, I felt real tangible emotions as events with each character/turning point deepens the tragedy. The one aspect I don't like was the intensity of this film... its almost like watching films the likes of Saving Private Ryan... more like a stressful experience than simple entertainment.However, if you go in expecting extravagant sword fights, kung-fu, battles, you are going to be disappointed."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Well, I went into the last movie I'm watching of 2006 with very low expectations after reading some reviews, and I must say I was still kind of disappointed coming out of it. I don't know what Zhang Yimou is doing, but his movies have been on a steady decline since the great ""Hero"". This movie, like ""House of Flying Daggers"", is BEAUTIFULLY made, but lacks substance.Let's talk about the cinematography first. The colors, details, patterns, and the views of the palace were so expertly filmed that I was in awe the first 30 minutes of the movie. Zhang continues his perfect track record in making spectacular visual epics in this movie. The acting was also very good, anchored by experienced great actors like Chou Yun-Fat and Gong Li. Even with my average score, if you are the type of movie goer that appreciates great visual feats in movies, I would recommend you check this movie out.Now for the disappointing bits. There wasn't too much plot involved other than your standard double-crossing/spy-vs-spy story. It reached the point of absurdity when new characters were introduced an hour into the movie to add a new plot twist in the already complicated web of intrigue. The entire process felt very heavy handed and damaged the impact of the tragedies in the movie. The battle scenes were very fake (you can easily tell it was CGI) and the ending was horrendous. It just left the entire audience hanging, and did not tie up the most important plot line of the movie. It really left a bad taste in my mouth after watching the movie.Anyway, I hope Zhang's next movie focuses more on the plot (like Hero) and less on the spectacles. Otherwise, his good name as a director will probably go down the drain."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"""Curse of the Golden Flower"" can be best described as an apotheosis of overwrought kitsch, hyper-saturated colors and military choreography. Everything in it is big, lavish, excessive, but staged in a clockwork style; every shot spells *money* and ""extravaganza"", but under stiff control. If you -- like me -- once marveled at Zhang Yimou's refined artistry in masterpieces like ""Ju Dou"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern"", you'll be baffled by ""Curse"": it's hardly to believe they were directed by the same man. After ""Hero"" and ""Flying Daggers"", Zhang completes with ""Curse"" his exhibitionist, rococo trilogy, where the ""message"" (i.e. the connections between power and corruption) gets crushed under formalist grandeur, militarist fascination and commercial targets.The colors in ""Curse"" belong to a sort of Phosphorescent Lollipopland, with blazing goldens, sanguine scarlets, shocking purples and pinks; it feels like a color-blind exam. The lighting is so overdone it's flat; the sets so overwrought and overcrowded that Hollywood Bible epics of the 1950s look minimalistic by comparison. The costumes, though masterfully executed, are so flamboyantly flashy they upstage the actors. Oh, and as many reviewers pointed out, there are those anachronistic (?) popping boobs...very distracting:)The CGI work is underachieved; the music is monotonous and incongruously Westernish. The action scenes are lukewarm at best: Zhang is a flat, unexciting fight director -- he doesn't know how to edit them. The plot is even more convoluted than the sets, while the dialog alternates between risible clichés and hermetic symbolisms. The cast is told to over-act: Chow Yun Fat sulks, groans, squints his BLUE (!) contact lensed-eyes, and combs his goatee with a cool gadget-ring. Gong Li suffers, trembles, cries, suffers, trembles, cries, drinks endless cups of poisoned tea and feels sick all the time (is it the stifling wonder-bra or the smell of the script?). Song pop-star Jay Chou has an interesting face, but is betrayed by the director, who lingers on his clueless ""reaction"" shots, revealing Chou's lack of proper acting training. The closing credits song (which Chou produced, wrote and sang) just proves that bad pop songs exist everywhere. What IS remarkable about ""Curse"" is the flabbergasting amount of money spent to tell what is, after all, a huis clos story: all that matters in the plot takes place indoors -- the CGI, the battles, the armies, the ninjas, the fights are pretty much there to satisfy action junkies, justify the stratospheric budget and crush the audience with a paraphernalia of excesses.Also remarkable, of course, is Zhang's taste for unimaginative, clockwork crowd choreography: thousands of real and virtual extras flow by in rigid geometric patterns with a maniac precision that can only be described as military-inspired. No wonder Zhang has been appointed to stage the opening ceremony at the next Beijing's Olympics: ""Curse"" serves as his zillion-yuan test for the job. All of this made me think of how Zhang's substantial, ground-breaking past work has turned into vacuous formalism and establishment-friendly status. And I recalled his notorious megalomania and authoritarianism (check the documentary ""The Turandot Project"" by Alan Miller) and his quote saying ""My films are an excellent channel for promoting China's culture"".""Curse"" is a gigantic soufflé, an exhausting mammoth extravaganza made by a self-obsessed, control-freak artist who -- though he states in interviews his ""aversion to politics"" -- seems to feed on, cherish and serve the very status quo he thinks he transcends."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is a sumptuous and beautiful film – a real treat for the senses. Every shot has been painstakingly put together, and the colour palette on display here is like nothing you've ever seen before. The scenery is almost overpowering in its luxury. Now usually, I'd follow this description up by saying something like 'unfortunately, there's no plot to go with it' – but not in this case. CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is a Shakespearian tragedy told anew and a film Kurosawa himself would have been proud of.At its heart, this is a family drama. Corruption, secrets and lies always seem to be present at the highest households in the country, and it's no exception here. A web of blackmail, adultery, incest, poison and murder unfolds in a completely spellbinding way and it's an added bonus that the cast can do the story so much justice. Gong Li is fantastic as the centrepiece of the film, the doomed empress trying to get herself out of an impossible situation; the three actors playing the sons are all brilliant in their own way, and Chow Yun-Fat makes for a hissable yet understandable villain.Of course, there's the martial arts too. While I would have preferred for more realism, there's no denying the artistry of the fights here. Watching shadowy assassins flying through the air or an army of golden warriors battling it out with their silver enemies is breathtaking and tremendously entertaining. This is a film that starts off slowly before ending on a real high – a modern masterpiece at that. I hated HERO and really liked HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS – but CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER is the best yet!"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Shakespearian and flawed, moving and irritating, talky and with an impossibly high body count, Hamlet meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Zhang Yimou's Curse of the Golden Flower is often interesting, but uneven to say the least.Ancient China: the Emperor (Chow Yun-Fat) is slowly poisoning his wife (Gong Li), who has a relationship with her stepson Wan (Ye Liu), heir to the throne. The other two sons are Jai (Jay Chou) and Yu (Junjie Qin). Jai decides to help his mother overthrow the Emperor, while Wan takes his father's side. There are moments of sheer beauty in the Curse of the Golden Flower, but also phoney and contrived scenes. Some set-pieces are great - ninjas assaulting a house in a misty valley, a battle with golden and silver armours clashing - but other moments look uncomfortably computer-generated. The film does not achieve the visual magnificence of Yimou's Hero.Every frame is saturated with deep colours, creating an oppressive atmosphere inside the maze-like palace, with the always-repeating ritual of the ""cure"" with which the Emperor poisons his wife. Gorgeous Gong Li plays the Empress and gives a powerful performance as a woman driven by strong feelings. Also excellent is the always charismatic Chow Yun-Fat as the Emperor, a cruel tyrant who is genuinely fond of his sons. Jay Chou and Ye Liu are fine as the two princes faced with moral dilemmas. Hero is one of the best-looking movies ever made, but I found it morally reprehensible. Here the message is more ambiguous, with Yimou trying to show the brutality and solitude of power in this Shakespearian tragedy set in Ancient China.The result falls somewhere between ""brilliant but flawed"" and ""interesting failure"", worth watching for some compelling moments and strong performances.6/10"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"The best way to visualize this campy historical spectacle is to imagine Douglas Sirk and Sam Peckinpah collaborating on a 1950s decadent Roman Empire movie starring Clark Gable as the Emperor and Joan Crawford as the Empress.The story is set at the imperial court in fictitious 10th century China. The Emperor (Chow Yun-fat in a goatee, looking unnervingly like Charlie Chan), is the picture of Confucian rectitude and virtue. It's only a picture; with the aid of the Imperial Doctor, he is poisoning the Empress with a slow poison that will drive her crazy. The Empress (an imperious Gong Li) suspects that something is going on; she is planning a coup d'etat for the night of the Chrysanthemum Festival. As part of her plan, she is carrying on an affair with the Crown Prince, who is the Emperor's son by his deceased first wife. The Crown Prince is also carrying on an affair with the daughter of the Imperial Doctor; he doesn't know that she is personally in charge of slipping the poisoned ingredient into the Empress's prescription. Despite his active love life, the Crown Prince is a self-doubting dweeb who has never left the Imperial Palace. Meanwhile, Second Brother, who is the embodiment of martial virtue and filial piety, has just come home after a three year hitch fighting the barbarians on the frontier. He honors his father, loves his mother, thinks he's a better man than his half brother, and wouldn't mind being Emperor one day. Third Brother, still in his mid-teens, is shy and doesn't say a lot, but he has has mastered Yogi Berra's principle that you can observe a lot by watching. He has his own ideas and his own ambitions. Meanwhile, the Emperor is beginning to think that the Imperial Doctor and his daughter Know Too Much, and he personally knows a good deal more than he's let on. Then the First Mrs. Emperor turns up alive, revealing secrets that upset a lot of apple carts.The sets and the clothes make the court of Louis XIV at Versailles look like a trailer park, and I, for one, had never realized that 10th century China had mastered the tavern wench style push-up bra a thousand years before Victoria's Secret. We get opulent palace interiors, gorgeous costumes, hordes of groveling male and female servants, elaborate rituals, midnight gallops, shocking revelations, stunning betrayals, stabs in the back, ninja assassins, acrobatic swordplay, both individual and en masse, and blood splattered everywhere. It's all done in the gaudiest, most saturated color imaginable, with a particular emphasis on gold and crimson. At the end, there is one person left standing. The servants come out, sweep up the dead bodies, sluice away the blood and put out fresh flowers. The Chrysanthemum Festival goes off with barely a hitch.If there is a moral, it is that appearances must and will be preserved at all costs. It's all empty calories, like cotton candy, but if you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Very beautifully made film, with great attention to detail. The plot is basically a domestic dispute between the emperor, empress, the emperor's first wife, the emperor's three sons. As each can command thousands of people at a single whim and none are allowed to express any opinion on the interior design of the castle, it grows kind of epic.And this is basically it. I don't really know the story of McBeth this was supposed to take after and I haven't seen Blood Throne either. One just grows frustrated more and more seeing what is going on in the Forbidden City, then it all ends.Bottom line: one of the weirdest films I've seen in a while, and I really do seek weird, worth seeing if you are in the mood for epic Chinese decors and plot, but beware you might also get really bored and ask at the end ""what was that?"". Extra points for weird."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Tarantino could probably provide more contemporary celluloid examples, but the closest I can come to the plot of this elaborate epic of vicious royal conflict outside the world of Greek tragedy is the Jacobean revenge plays. And it's got the poisoning that was all the rage in those days, as well as incest. Nothing too complicated, really. An emperor (Chow Yun-fat) of the later Tang Dynasty (tenth century A.D.) is slowly killing his current consort (Gong Li), through a royal doctor whose wife Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), unbeknownst to him, is an old mistress of his and the mother of one of three possible heirs to the throne, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), who is unwittingly having an affair with his step-sister, the doctor's daughter Chan (Li Man), and has knowingly been the lover of his stepmother, the empress. You could say things are rather inbred in the Forbidden City. The empress, who suspects the hourly herbal teas to treat an ""illness"" are slowly killing her (and turning her into a ""cretin""), is preparing a surprise to coincide with the oncoming Chong Yang Festival celebrating golden chrysanthemums. As the overwrought action draws to a climax one of the sons lays siege to the palace with a large army garbed in gold and embroidered chrysanthemum images, and a third son reveals another surprise: he doesn't like anybody and wants to become emperor, now. Fields of flowers are drenched in blood before it's all over, and digital armies have clashed by night, with hordes of red- or black-garbed ninjas flying down from on high to capture individual royal rebels.This grandiose affair is not without notable performances and wonderful looking people, chief among them Gong Li, whose outsize emotions are worthy of a Greek tragedy  except that Medea didn't have six-inch-long elaborately painted fingernails. Gong's face is mesmerizing to look at. Prince Jai (Jay Chou) looks fabulous and sexy in a war helmet. John Woo favorite gangster/cop hero of the Eighties Chow Yun-fat manages to be both appealing and scary as the emperor and Li Man as the taboo girlfriend is just the prettiest thing you've ever seen. Why doesn't it work better? I think back to the pleasure provided by House of Flying Daggers and I believe the difference lies in the claustrophobic nature of this story, most of which takes place inside a garish recreation of the palace that looks like a very, very expensive jukebox. There's just too much material here crammed into too confined a space with ornamental violence that seems too unrelated to the central core of royal machinations. I suppose these older-generation Chinese epics are the equivalent of popular folk art  except they don't come from the people but from an increasingly international-focused film industry whose creations are neither culturally authentic nor emotionally convincing.This is also a very nasty story. It's demoralizing to find a royal family whose members are all out to get each other. But if we got to look in on that in emotionally valid terms  if some time was taken to develop the feelings and conflicts instead of constantly interrupting them with kung-fu action or vast scenes of concubines all with identical cleavages, or ninjas spinning around with curved weapons in the air  the nastiness might develop some conviction. As it is, this is a spectacle that seems both ugly and hollow at the core. Anyone who is seriously pleased by this may not be paying much attention to what they're seeing. Sure, as a spectacle it's frequently eye-popping. But its pretense at content is superficial."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"First i thank my parents to have picked this Chinese movie because i think it's my first one in 1000+ reviews. Sure my taste explains it but i can't also train it if i don't have opportunities. For that, France is awful because except our language and American production, media are close to foreign films, maybe due to the fact that we think we are genius and all the world is retarded! This movie is the flagrant proof that China can make movies too and in addition at an extraordinary level! When i see that Bertollucci is praised for his big historical movies, that LOTR is praised for its hardworking production, here you have the same efforts, poetry, choreography and however no recognition! This movie lost its single Oscar for costumes and didn't have nominations in Cesars! So it's shameful ostracism if not racism. But i let this poor fed-up experts to have fun with their hollow, stupid, soulless western movies while me i enjoy the oriental ones as they are the ones left to bring us what movies should be!"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"First of all, this is a commercial movie of period drama with some sort of martial arts in it. If you're looking for anything deeper, then it's not for you although the movie is loosely based on a masterpiece of play in China. That being said, I think it's actually a nice movie.Story: B The story line is nothing amazing but flows well although not devoid of a few confusions or loopholes. For the people who're not familiar with all the power struggle, backstabbing stories of Chinese royal families, some relationships and emotions may seem a bit too much. And it did actually get a bit overheated at certain point possibly for theatrical tensions. But overall, it made sense to me. My major complaint is that he could have cut out some of the side stories while allowing the major line to a fuller development.Acting: B+ This movie focuses on Gong Li and she's a good actress. So, yes, she did a great job even though I wish it could have been toned down a bit. Chow Yun-fat is also good but his role is not as rich as hers. Liu Ye (crown prince) is adequate for his role and the character also has a limited range. Jay Zhou (the second son)is not quite up to par with the others (after all, he's not a professional actor). But he got better in the end.Visuals: A- Actually, I wanted to give it a B+ but I awarded it a higher mark for being so daring. It does have tons of colors and shades in it. Most of time, they actually work out cool, at least for me. But I totally understand if someone finds it way over-the-top. I actually like the fact that ZYM used bright colors, only if he had used fewer kinds of them. Those fighting scenes didn't quite catch my attention not because they're no good. Actually they're proper and effective. But since I've seem so many martial arts movies, they did not bring any surprises to meOverall, it's an entertaining movie with an understandable story and believable characters."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Chinese filmmakers have a double curse. They have this tradition where individuals only matter in context, so when there is a spat between a man and his wife, it can only be illustrated in large sweeps of society. This is compounded by the ability to marshal (real, human) extras and extravagant sets on a scale unmatchable anywhere else.I liked this filmmaker's earlier projects. ""To Live"" really was able to show the inside of a man by mapping it to lurches and sweeps in the world around him. ""Daggers"" was at least a masterpiece of ballet. And ""Hero,"" probably my favorite, was the most cinematic, expressing real human qualities in luxurious cinematic terms. Who can forget the spatial existence of discovered deceit in the flickering flames in front of the throne?This is a wholly different formula in how the internals of a family sweep into the environment. The setup is an extraordinary web of relationships between two families. Some commentors think this is drawn from soap opera, but I think they have a common ancestor instead. This is Greek, and though on daytime TeeVee you will get similar relationship complexities, they will have their tethers to the cosmos broken. They will be single souls adrift in the world. These are souls that command the world, apparently. It could have worked. Why it didn't I think is because the filmmaker decided to root himself in the magisterial. It probably was influenced by the fact that he is a former lover of the female star and there are some reflections between that situation and what we see. Its ""Annie Hall"" with flying ninjas instead of lobsters. Breasts instead of the swirling of engagement. Narrative mistrust where Woody had open exploration and experimentation. Diane and Woody were in a place, a city that colored them. These characters here ARE the city.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"Even with flaws and all- and there are a couple at least here in Curse of the Golden Flower- I can only think of a handful of filmmakers that have shot to the moon like this and gotten away with it. Zhang Yimou tried it before with Hero and, for me, sort of didn't pull through completely successfully (not that it hasn't gained its share of fans, and House of Flying Daggers was actually incredible (both for being able to pull off its wacky high-flying action scenes and scoring as a romantic drama) and the top of the pops in Yimou's big-budget melodramas. 'Golden Flower' comes pretty close, if not totally, to 'Flying Daggers' successes, even if it's possibly even more entertaining and acted on a level that goes to the lengths of emotional absurdity. I don't think I could ever see an American action-epic with the kinds of dark, secret, and lost characters in a film like this, and while I would say the action sequences and battles in said Western counterparts might make a little more sense, the pageantry and power of the visuals strikes this one a bit more extraordinary.I wish I could put the plot into context, but it might take too long, and it's already provided on the main page of the site. Suffice to say though it's a mouthful to try and explain it all in one piece; simply put, we're given a tragedy as it unfolds more so on the personal level up until the last half hour, where Emperor Ping (Chow Yun Fat) and his Empress Phoenix (Gong Li) are in a crippled marriage, and hidden behind the rituals and strict decorum and everyday mercies of circumstance there's hatred on both sides, with the Emperor plotting his wife's murder via poison in the medicine she drinks, and once discovered her plot against him through various channels. There's also the Freudian ties between the sons- two from both of them and one from the Emperor and a previous woman (who will be of significance to much of the picture)- including not only a liaison between mother and step-son, but between a half-brother and half-sister. In between an amazing bout that occurs with quasi-Chinese ninjas storming the Phyisican and his wife's home, including grappling hooks and chaos and a chase, and a massively epic battle sequence in the Emperor's enormous stretch of royal grounds, there are many scenes that are intimately attuned for the actors, and pitched just high enough to make it delirious fun and sobering in sadness.Sure, it's over-the-top stuff that one might read in another permutation in a trashy supermarket novel, but Yimou is smart enough to let the actors take this material to work much better than one would expect. Gong Li, really, is the centerpiece here as the Empress torn by a life of diligent servitude, only to find that her long-standing sickness is not getting any better (there are a few scenes of power where she almost breaks down in cold sweats and shaking fits), and her allegiances become all the more torn, twisted and fragmented by the poison doing bad things to her mind, and to her tryst with her step-son, and to her intentions towards her wretched husband. It's a great performance, worthy of Luchino Visconti, whom I thought of a couple of times watching the picture in terms of comparing operatic to operatic. Chow Yun Fat, too, is fantastic at being the man who corrupts not necessarily really his control over his empire, but that he can't tell through the third person referrals from his children what's really going on. The scenes of revelations during the last half hour, which include him showing the true state of his hair (a real wicked moment), are some of the best of the film. The rest of the cast, too, does pretty well for themselves, even if one or two of them (mostly the youngest son) don't take too much to the over-the-top styling.And the over-the-top, sensationalism of the picture does have its drawbacks, too. I'll need to see the film again to totally understand things in terms of the action set-pieces, like which side was which (I did finally get a sense of what happened by film's end, of course, but like with Hero I felt a little boggled). The music is also monotonous from time to time, albeit with touches of grace and just-right flamboyance. And there might be almost TOO much to put into suspension of disbelief with some of the dysfunctions in the family chain(s), like with Prince Wan and his little girl-on-the-side who's really more than either would think of to be. But I really put myself into not just the operatic intonations, the Shakespeare-goes-Eastern story and characters which highlight the madness and decay in royalty, but the epic scope of the picture as well. The costume design, up for an Oscar, is a small marvel, though the production and art design ranks up with the best I've seen in the decade, where the colors are more than lush, as if out of some artist's fever-dream interpretation of what the insides of a palace look like. And Yimou's camera moves along this world- and gets the battle scenes- with the efficiency and skill that he's been building towards since Hero. Even if what you see might seem all too ridiculous, you likely can't take your eyes away.Is 'Golden Flower' almost too morbid? Perhaps, and the characters run the risk of veering off into being cheap in its melodrama. This being said, it ends up working on all of its levels, more or less, and it thrills while it pokes into the psychologies of its magisterial characters, and it ends on a very stirring note. A-"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"I went to see this movie with a slightly heavy heart. I have been a huge fan of Zhang Yimou since seeing Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern some years ago. But while i really enjoyed 'Flying Daggers' as pure entertainment, i thought 'Hero' was little more than a beautiful propaganda piece for the government of China. Based on reading some reviews of 'Curse', i was beginning to think that he was the new Leni Riefenstahl.But how wrong I was - I'm very surprised that all the critics who lined up to explain to western audiences the anti-government metaphors of his earlier movies have reviewed this as a pure soap opera, a glorified 'Dynasty'. But they seem to forget that the exact same could be said of his earlier masterpieces such as Red Lantern. Those movies too were sometimes stagy and fully of internal dramatic inconsistencies that didn't stand up to too much analysis. But this movie is every much a devastating critique of centralized power as any of his earlier movies. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with Chinese history and politics knows that the current government of China is very much a continuum of earlier dynasties, with Party Officials performing the same roles as the old Confucian bureaucrats. This movie is a straightforward satire of such centralized power with clear modern parallels. The clearing up of the aftermath of the 'coup' and the similarities with what happened after Tiananmen Square in 1989 is all too obvious.Anyway, having gotten that off my chest, suffice to say this is a gloriously over the top epic with staggering settings and set pieces, and of course it has Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li in the same movie, which should be enough pure pleasure for anyone.I had my strong doubts up to this, but I think in years to come critics will see this as one of a series of truly masterful movies from Zhang Yimou that will collectively consist of a coherent and brilliant artistic and political statement, not to mention pure kick ass cinematic pleasure."
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"While this is far from my favorite Chinese movie, it is one I strongly recommend you see simply because of its spectacular battle sequences in the last third of the film. While it's obvious in places that lots of CG technology was used, it still is amazing seeing battle sequences that come close to those from the Lord of the Rings films in grandeur and scope.The plot itself reminds me a bit of A LION IN WINTER and I, CLAUDIUS since it follows the very dysfunctional machinations of the emperor and his family. After a while, it becomes a bit difficult figuring who's scheming against who and keeping track of all the amoral actions of the cast that make them seem much like a more dysfunctional and power-made group than the famed Borgias of Italy! All this is done in amazing style and grace, though the first third of the film might seem a bit too slow for many. I'll concede this is a bit true, but urge the viewer to stick with it--the film inexorably draws to an amazing conclusion in which 1000 extras were employed in a huge battle in which it appears that about 50000 troops were fighting to a very, very bloody death. And please note that I did say ""bloody"". This film earned an R rating even though there is no nudity and the language is rather tame--all because buckets and buckets of fake blood are used and the deaths are at times very brutal.In closing, there are a couple things to look for. First, the ninja-like assassins are really high on the cool factor. They are of course over-the-top as is some of the action, but it is far more believable and uses far less of the high-flying gadgetry of films such as CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. Also, watch the scene were the emperor and his #2 son have a sword fight near the beginning of the film--wow is THAT exciting!"
满城尽带黄金甲,Curse of the Golden Flower (2006),,2006,2006.12.21,"China in the 10th Century has seen Emperor Ping rule over all. His new Empress Phoenix has had two sons with him and has raised a third from his previous wife. Unspoken resentments and mistrust exist within the Royal family  even without the knowledge of an affair between Phoenix and her stepson. However on the eve of the Chong Yang festival, Ping returns to the palace with Prince Jai to celebrate the holidays. At this time it becomes clear to Empress Phoenix that she is being slowly poisoned by Ping and, while power moves silently play out within the palace, armies prepare for a bloody internal conflict.I didn't bother with the Curse of the Golden Flower at the cinema and even on DVD it was low down my rental priority list. The reason for this was that the trailer made it look like just another film with lots of martial arts flying and ""meaningful"" plot. I'd been excited about Hero and House of Flying Daggers and not actually be that taken by them so I figured I would be OK without more of it. Watching it on television recently though I'm happy to hold my hands up and say that I have been reminded not to follow preconceptions because this film is not like that at all. Instead what we have here is a richly delivered plot of intrigue and betrayal within the royal family. This culminates in a series of bloody sequences where the truth comes out as to who is controlling whom and the victor remains standing. If there is an allegory then it is not rammed in the face of the audience at the expense of everything else. This allowed me to enjoy the story for what it was and enjoy it I did.The story is enhanced by the delivery, which gives the entire film a look of richness and decadence that informs and develops the characters and their motivations. Within this pressure cooker of power, the silent stand offs do tend to bristle with tension as I hoped and the stakes feel so much higher. Also bigger is the scale; when the action comes it is large and impacting. OK so you probably need to be able to accept some acts of gravity defying action but not too much because here the focus is more on the scale of the battles as opposed to the movement of one-on-one fights. I preferred this and, although it lost the beauty of such fights, it gained from delivering something of real impact.The cast work very well  again much better than the cast in the other films I mentioned. Yun-Fat is convincingly powerful and callous in his role. Li is much better though as she has more of an emotional core to her character and she plays it out very well; I liked her a lot here. Jay, Ye, Qin, Jin and others all deliver well in the supporting roles but for me it was pretty much Gong Li's film. Yimou directs with real flourish and style; in another film perhaps it would have been too rich and seem excessive but within the context of this story it works really well.Overall then a rich and satisfying tale of intrigue and betrayal at the very top. Bloody, callous and passionate, the scale and design of the film suit the story and make the film an enjoyable and engaging tale that is worth seeing."
撒娇女人最好命,Women Who Flirt (2014),,2014,2014.11.28,"'Women Who Flirt' sees director Pang Ho Cheung take a creative sojourn from his Hong Kong-set dramas like 'Aberdeen' and comedies like 'Vulgaria' by engaging in some shamelessly commercial pursuits. Inspired by the self-help book 'Everyone Loves Tender Woman' by Loverman, this Mainland-based rom-com has a tomboyish girl Angie (Zhou Xun) pick up the tricks of flirting from a gaggle of female friends who call themselves the 'Barbie Army' in order to win the affections of her best friend Marco (Huang Xiaoming), whom she has always been secretly in love with, after he falls for a Taiwanese girl called Hailey (Tang Sui) skilled in the art of 'sa jiao'.Though Pang has personally penned this big-screen adaptation together with his 'Love in the Buff' collaborator Luk Yee-Sum and newcomer Zhang Youyou, his latest displays little of the witticisms that fans of his works – us included – look forward to. At least his maiden foray into Mainland filmmaking, 'Love in the Buff', retained his distinctive voice while staying within the safe zone of the notorious censors (remember the joke about the air stewardess or the music video Shawn Yue made to prove his sincerity to Miriam Yeung?); save for the occasional amusing references to Patrick Swayze's 'Ghost' and Andrew Lau's 'The Guillotines', this is indistinguishable from the crop of rom-coms that have become a staple of the Mainland box office, no thanks to a voracious appetite from the genre from audiences there.Much of the humour is derived (and derivative) from gender stereotypes, or more specifically, that of women which men tend to gravitate towards. From taking every opportunity to showcase maximum cleavage to saying 'I hate you' in a mischievously high-pitched girlish pout to giving men the chance to feel protective over a woman, Pang up-ends each one of these manipulative techniques women supposedly use in order to get men to fall hopelessly head over heels. There is some fun to be had in watching these tricks of the flirting trade being outed for what they are, but the pleasures afforded by these jokes are shallow, fleeting and grow increasingly tiresome.Thankfully, Zhou Xun's spirited delivery ensures that their repetitiveness does not completely ingratiate. Her diminutive frame and husky voice don't make her the prototype Asian girl for rom- coms, but that is precisely why she is perfectly cast in the role. When she casts doubt on her makeover consultants' 'one-two-five' Tinder-ready selfies, you believe that her cynicism is genuine. When she eventually decides to tear into her 'love opponent's' seductive moves, you'll applaud her comebacks. Zhou's screwball comic timing is impeccable, and her considerable charm is a huge reason why the movie remains lively and entertaining in parts.If the humour is mostly silly and shallow, the romance is sadly artificial. Except for a couple of flashbacks which establish Angie and Marco as college buddies who shared much platonic banter and several playful moments together, there is little else that convinces just why Angie would be in love with Marco or why Marco is in fact in love with Angie as well but just doesn't know it yet. Even more perplexing is how Pang rationalises the latter, which falls to some hokey premise about how Marco is in fact ""gay"" for having been brought up without a maternal figure and is therefore perfectly matched with the masculine Angie. Unlike Chun Jiao and Zhi Ming in Pang's previous two rom-coms 'Love with a Puff' and 'Love in the Buff', you'll be hard-pressed to believe that there is genuine affection in Angie and Marco's relationship, or for that matter, that the pair make a good couple.Like we said at the beginning, 'Women Who Flirt' finds Pang at his most ready-to-please, forgoing his usual sensibilities for a wholly commercial product that is certainly poised to do well at the Mainland box office. If all you're looking for is a light, frothy and forgettable time, then you'll find your share of disposable pleasures here; but anyone else looking for the Pang Ho Cheung of contemporary classics like 'You Shoot, I Shoot' and 'Exodus' would be advised to flirt with something else instead."
撒娇女人最好命,Women Who Flirt (2014),,2014,2014.11.28,"42 minutes into the ordeal and I called it quits...Wait, I am getting ahead of myself here.I sat down in 2020 to watch the 2014 movie ""Women Who Flirt"" (aka ""Sa jiao nu ren zui hao ming"") from writers Ho-Cheung Pang and Yee-sum Luk without ever having heard of it. So I didn't know what I was getting myself into, well aside from knowing it to be a Chinese romantic comedy.Granted, I am not overly much a fan of the romantic comedy genre, but still, I hadn't seen the movie before, so I gave it a chance.And I lasted 42 minutes, then I just couldn't take anymore of the suffering. The storyline in ""Woman Who Flirt"" was just utter rubbish, and it didn't help one bit that the characters were flaccid, pointless and unappealing. So I don't think that director Ho-Cheung Pang managed a great deal with this movie.I wasn't the least bit entertained, so this is not a movie that I will be returning to watch the rest of. I just simply doesn't have any interest in the movie.My rating of ""Woman Who Flirt"" is a mere three out of ten stars, and that is mostly because of the production value and the acting performances; as they were both adequate. Just a shame that the rest of the movie was atrociously bad."
撒娇女人最好命,Women Who Flirt (2014),,2014,2014.11.28,"A wonderful, lighthearted and cheerfully refreshing comedy. This simple story shines quite bright by comparison to gloomy, pretentiously profound and pseudo-historical dramas of modern days. I think despite its obvious simplicity it does strike a cord by pointing to the obvious - most of us most of times tend to over-think and make things more complicated. We also take ourselves more seriously then we should and credit others rather lightly. The acting considering quite young team is very good. It would appear that movie was created for a younger audience, but I am sure that even wider audience will enjoy this funny, romantic adventure. Go and see for yourself!"
撒娇女人最好命,Women Who Flirt (2014),,2014,2014.11.28,"I loved this movie. Characters were perfect, great script writing, funny, sweet romance. Casting was amazing!!

Recommend highly glad I finally watched it."
一生一世,But Always (2014),,2014,2014.9.5,"Anyone who's been in a relationship will tell you that sincerity is one of the most important ingredients, and so it is with the best romances that we read on the page or watch on the screen – which is the reason why 'But Always' isn't a true romance. It operates under a veneer of sincerity, leading you into thinking that it is some portrait of undying love, when in fact it is quite the opposite, leaving you feeling used, cheated, and ultimately frustrated.A tale of two childhood sweethearts that spans Beijing and New York, it plots the ups and downs of Zhao Yongyuan (his last name meant to rhyme with 'forever' in Chinese) and An Ran's love for each other against the vicissitudes of life. The tale begins in 1976 against the backdrop of the Tangshan earthquake, where An Ran loses her mother to the tragedy and is subsequently raised by her father. On the other hand, Zhao loses both his parents, and is tended by his grandmother who struggles to make ends meet in order to provide for her grandchild. Because of his family's poverty, Yongyuan is often the scruffiest kid in school, who is also therefore ostracised by his classmates.But An Ran strikes up an unlikely friendship with Yongyuan after an unexpected act of kindness on her part, so much so that they end up taking the same bus to school every day and hanging out together after as well. The sudden death of Yongyuan's grandmother is the first turning point of their relationship, when his uncle (Lam Suet) takes him away without giving him the opportunity to say goodbye to An Ran. As far as such childhood romances go, it is as sweet and innocent as it gets, though the brevity of it doesn't quite explain why the pair will be as emotionally tied.The next act unfolds 18 years later when Yongyuan follows his uncle back to Beijing to help out in the latter's street stall, the former now played by Nicholas Tse. It is one propitious day that he chances upon An Ran, who is now a medical student looking forward to a university education in America. Although neither Gao Yuanyuan (who plays An Ran) or Tse look anything like their younger selves, they immediately recognise each other, and realise that each is still very much fond of the other. For sheer narrative necessity, Yongyuan runs afoul of the law while trying to protect An Ran from a spot of trouble, and the next turning point comes when the former is sent to jail while the latter goes forth to pursue her dream of a brighter future in New York.Fast forward a couple of years more and we catch up with both of them in the Big Apple; but whereas An Ran is now working as a tour guide, Yongyuan is a successful businessman on Wall Street whose masterful grasp of English proves that you can do a lot with your time in prison. Though the hand of fate has turned, Yongyuan is still very much in love with An Ran, and despite knowing that she is already attached to a painter (Qin Hao), wants to let her know that his feelings for her have never diminished through the years. On the other hand, An Ran is less sure, and only sparks to Yongyuan's advances after being convinced of his sincerity - alas, a happily ever after isn't on the minds of co- writer and director Snow Zou.In a most clichéd turn of events, An Ran's on- and off-boyfriend is left paralysed from the waist down after a car accident, and because he had just visited her prior to it, she feels responsible for his condition and chooses to stay by his side to take care of him. But just as you think Zou might be ending things on a bittersweet note, he goes on to deliver yet another stunner straight out of a certain Robert Pattinson movie called 'Remember Me'. Yes, it's no coincidence that our couple find themselves in New York in the year 2001, but instead of being poignant, that supposed twist is so shamelessly manipulative that it may leave you infuriated.It comes off even worse when you consider the coda at the end, which sees An Ran returning to Beijing in 2014 on board a bus which announces how many Chinese like her are doing likewise to take advantage of the opportunities in their own hinterland. Admittedly, Peter Chan's most recent 'American Dreams in China' also had the same message, but the positioning here reeks of sheer insensitivity, so much so that you won't be thinking of the romance by the time the movie is over.On their part, Tse and Gao try to muster as much chemistry they have with each other against weak plotting and one-note characterisation, but ultimately neither their characters nor their relationship resonates as much as it should. There aren't any strong supporting characters to speak of, which is why it is fortunate that the cinematography is excellent, so even though the story or the characters aren't particularly engaging, the shots are always pretty to look at.But of course, it takes more than a collection of beautiful shots to make a compelling movie, and 'But Always' falls way short of that by wringing what goodwill it manages to muster on a conclusion that is clearly intended as political subtext. Right from the point An Ran leaves for America to the point she returns to Beijing, the film tries to be a cautionary tale for those still under the ""illusion"" that the West holds greener pastures, even going to the extent of exploiting one of the most tragic events in recent memory to underscore that point. Like we said, it is a film without sincerity, and some may say, also without integrity."
一生一世,But Always (2014),,2014,2014.9.5,"Caught it on TV and was surprised to learn it came out last year. A movie starring Nicholas Tse yet never heard of it, now I know why. The main characters are beautiful to look at. The camera-work is amazing, our heroine's face and innocence glows like a pearl, and Nicholas Tse is very swoon some. Some light- hearted humorous moments. Otherwise it is full of clichés, and the movie suffers also from heavy handed approach in plot and pacing. The romance marries "" rich guy saves helpless girl"" and still their fate is twisted. I can hear he audience screaming in frustration as they leave the cinema. Watch only if you want to waste money and time."

He is given another shot at his life; after he blacks out, getting drunk at his old crush's wedding. He wakes up in his old classroom back in his high-school days. Yes he goes back in time! Not a sci-fi by any means, but a good romantic comedy. The film is a fun ride of quick humour and good music. The script is well written and the characters well enacted. I was into the film from first to last, not a second of boredom! A feel-good movie worth your time. It does offer a powerful hidden-morale but that's for you to find out.Enjoy!!"

Using his memories of his former life, he eventually gets everything he wanted, including a major musical career and the girl from high school, only to realize how miserable it makes him.It's a very well written and performed comedy, with some real character exposition and funny jokes. While the outline is familiar to me -- I've been reading science fiction for more than five decades -- it's put together well, including some nice musical interludes to keep the audience happy. Although the sub-textual message is excessively normative -- don't hope for something more, but be happy with what you have -- it's put together in an unflaggingly engaging fashion."
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"Directors Da-Mo Peng and Fei Yan put China back on the comedy world map with work on ""Goodbye Mr. Loser"".""Goodbye Mr. Loser"" (aka ""Xia Luo te fan nao"") starts out in a very hilarious way. At a wedding, Xia Luo (played by Teng Shen) gets drunk and get the brilliant idea of singing a love song to his high school crush Qiuya (played by Zhi Wang), whom is getting married to someone else. This love song does not go well with Xia Lou's wife Ma Dong Mei (played by Li Ma). Xia Luo hides in the bathroom, but when he comes back out from hiding, he finds himself back in his glorious high school days. Has he been given a second chance to do things over, or is it a chance to relive his former prime? From there on the movie just keeps up its established hilarious atmosphere and keeps adding on to that. And writers and directors Da-Mo Peng and Fei Yan really deserve a big, big thumbs up on their accomplishment with ""Goodbye Mr. Loser"".There are so many funny moments throughout the course of this movie, and I found myself laughing hard so many times. I was thoroughly enjoying myself throughout the course of this movie, and I really liked the storyline.Furthermore, the characters in the movie were so well-rounded and detailed and unique. The characters in ""Goodbye Mr. Loser"" are colorful, memorable and outstanding, really adding a lot of flavor to the storyline.The cast list had some great talents to it, and people were doing really good jobs in bringing their characters to life on the screen as they performed in ""Goodbye Mr. Loser"".If you enjoy Asian cinema and comedies, then you should definitely take the chance to watch ""Goodbye Mr. Loser"" if you have the chance, because this is a memorable and entertaining movie."
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"How do people eat pizza in the future? To tell the truth, it is the peak of recent comedy movies, not relying on vulgar passages, natural and endless jokes, the main actors in place. At the same time, the music is well matched, especially the second generation of officials. It really sets off the harbors in the same period as garbage. However, some of the plot content is too much out of the loop, such as mother Xia, such as beautiful women, rich life must be unhappy."
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"In the movie, Xia Luo (portrayed by Shen Teng) is on his way to his high school crush's wedding. To hide from his raging wife, who barged in during the wedding, he ducks into the bathroom. When he comes out, he's back in high school. Even though it all turns out to be a dream and he never time traveled, everything he has in the dream represents what he subconsciously thinks he wants. Fame. Money. Success. A beautiful wife. But in reality, he doesn't even know what he wants. When he is poor, he wants riches. When he is rich, he wants his original (poor) life back. In real life, his mother is dead, so in his dream, she is alive. In real life, he is poor, so in the dream, he is rich, etc. But he eventually realizes that all the money and fame only make him even more miserable than he was before. His mother starts dating his friend, his wife cheats on him, etc. His ""dream life"" is beginning to shatter.The lesson of this movie was very valuable (be happy with what you have), but kind of chicken soup-y. However, overall, I would say it's a good parody on the ""dream lives"" of many of us."

On Qiuya's wedding he decides to get drunk and sing to Qiuya a love song. Madong Mei is not very happy with his behavior and attacks him. Xia Luo runs away and hides in the toilet.But when he leaves it, he is back to his high school days... And now he has a second chance. What will he change? Will he 'conquer' Qiuya's heart?The story is not to be taken too seriously (even if we actually get a couple of serious moments), and we can see the ending coming from almost the very beginning. But the plot is not really what matters in a time-travelling comedy. A story like this is perfect to be acted and directed with silliness in its heart. That the story is simple and self-centered around Xia Luo could be forgiven if it was funny and with a frantic pace. However the laughs come and go, and the pace is too uneven. That without forgetting that it has a couple of worrisome moments, starting with Xia Luo's penchant to sexually harass Qiuya after he has traveled back in time (even if he believes it is a dream).""Goodbye Mr.Loser"" is a not very original comedy, worth a couple of chuckles, but that is also way overacted and with problems of pace. A middling effort."
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"1. This is simply the most embarrassing experience of watching movies in my life.The film is really hot, and I have seen a 100% attendance. All the audience laughed, and the two girls who accompanied me laughed happily. However, I grinned about ten times in a hundred minutes (thanks to Yuan Hua and Yimei Mei for the laugh points). At other times, I have been saying ""too embarrassing"" ""how terrible"" and ""uncomfortable"" It was a comedy that made me sweat and sweat.At that time, I had realized the inner arrogance of this comedy's creator: their satire is so spicy, absurd and so malicious, and deliberately acting silly can not be ignored.2. But why does such a movie have such a chicken soup ending?Especially when I came back to review the reviews, I saw eyes full of ""warmth"", ""cherishment"", ""movement"" and ""middle-age crisis"" ... are we watching a movie? (The last time I saw such a mindless public opinion was on the page of ""Doraemon: Walk with me"", and I ""cried"" all over my eyes, I thought I was blind.)If I were a screenwriter, it would be malicious in the end: when Charlotte in Nan Ke's dream died of AIDS, let him die. Eleven of the ten viewers could guess that Charlotte was going back, and they were all happy. It 's not as good as this:As soon as the lens turned, a burst of white light, the face immersed in water. Then Ma Dongmei, leading the classmates, smashed the door of the wedding room toilet and found-Charlotte! My head is immersed in the water and suffocates myself!"
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"I was expecting a simple comedy but was touched by the love story. It is about a married man who did not know what he wanted. The leading character, Xia Luo, went to the wedding party of his high school crush, when he drank too much and started to re-iterate his ""love"" for her. His current wife, who was in the same high school class, came to the party and of course chaos followed, until he passed out from the alcohol. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in his high school class.The story developed from there, when Xia Luo was doing everything to get his crush to like him. At the same time, the wife had loved him since forever. It could have been a silly love triangle story, but the wife line had a lot of touching moments. So who did Xia Luo choose?The movie has quite some funny moments, nothing legendarily funny but good enough. Surprisingly it also made me cry. Overall a light comedy with a moving love story."
夏洛特烦恼,Goodbye Mr. Loser (2015),,2015,2015.10.09,"Engrossing film with pretty good production efforts. Catchy songs, and pretty good background score. One of the unique stories where our protagonist played by Shen Teng gets an opportunity to go back to his school days and a chance to redo his life. The only problem with this movie is that Shen Teng as his younger self looks completely out of place in the school environment. He looked more like a professor disguised as a student. They should have given more efforts towards portraying the actor as his younger self. A good example of achieving this feat is Christian Bale's transformation as Trevor Reznik for his movie The Machinist.Also, this movie feels like as if it had two sets of makers - one doing the 1st 1 hour, and the other doing the final 40 minute act which definitely steals the show. Watch it for the final 40 minutes of this movie."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"It's really difficult to review this film in a different language. In fact it's even tough to comprehend it for many Chinese who are distant from Peking for the reason that it entirely roots on the very local culture of Peking, of both yesterday and today.The main theme, to me, is about the change of belief.To many countries, the late half of the 20th century is a continuous of history. But in China, things are opposite. There was no much difference from North Korea till 1980s. But now it's more Capitalism than any genuine Capitalism countries. The old generation, including the Mr. Six, was born in the North Korea - like era. Although brainwashed by propaganda daily, what these former Peking boys value most are something traditional, the loyalty to friends and the courage to risk life for friends. They are really man, of great dignity, and will not bow down for money.The young generation, born in 1990s or 2000s, grew up in a totally different era. Peking, along other major cities of China, spent the last 20 years to become metropolitans cannot be differentiated from New York by appearance. The lifestyle of many Peking youth is in close association with alcohol, pub, racing cars. Also ironically, a significant portion of these playboys are descendants of those high rank communists who intended to shape the country to the 2nd USSR. Consequently, the belief of the younger generation, the worship of money and power, is totally different from the former.The film is of plenty vanishing features of old Peking, like the Peking alleys or so called Hu Tong, the parrot in the cage, and the last scene, a remarkable stamp of those heroic boys in 1970s who fight with Katanas (collections of high rank communist from Sino-japan war) and green woolen coats."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"I didn't expect to like this movie. The premise sounded dull and Feng Xiaogang was always known as a director rather than an actor. So imagine my surprise when I thought to myself after the credits rolled that wow, this is definitely one of my favorites of 2015.I love everything about it, I am familiar with Guan Hu as I have watched two of his films which I also liked and I thought this would be the first movie of his that I would hate. Turns out it'd be one of his best.Mr Six is not meant to be a hero or a sympathetic character even. He's an old guy set in his ways and stubborn to a great fault. Which is why the ending was fitting in all its symbolic glory.The character that really stayed with me was Xiao Fei, the spoiled brat turned sympathetic kid who looks up to the values of old and yearns for a father's attention. The interesting thing about this movie was that it also had the story of a father and son but the more compelling story was the one between a father and another man's son.I would recommend this movie to anyone. Brilliant and well-executed filmmaking."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,wow...the 2 hrs and change just flew by. i did'nt want this movie to end. this is a movie for people who love good movies. most of the people who dislike the movie were mislead into thinking it had some action in it. .......there is no action in this movie...not one iota.... it had suspenseful moments galore though. ex-gangsters and gangsters would totally dig this movie...hahaha...no joke. totally loved the scenes of normal Chinese life and there was a lot of that shown too. very very good suspense thriller movie with its own message to tell. old china clashes with new china head-on...who wins? watch the movie to find out...and people expecting any sort of action....stay away from this movie.
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Mr. Six was a Beijing crime boss who still has the respect of his hood despite being long retired, but he gets back into the game when his son gets into some trouble, owing rich privilege kids some money. It's not as action packed as I thought it would be from the plot line, Yet it's still very appealing as if you are watching an action movie.It's a lot like Unforgiven, as Mr. Six spends the film trying to reconnect with old ties in order to help his son. It was interesting seeing him handle himself ageist a foe that does not care about his past. The actor who played Mr. Six was very successful in his low key style of acting.It was funny and charming and dramatic perfectly at the same time."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"I wanted to write a review just to let cinema goers know that this is a well made movie, with a lot to like about it - but action is not one of them - because quite simply there is none - ZERO. Now don't get me wrong, i love all sorted of Asian cinema, drama, action, martial arts and thriller, but i am sick & tired of being mislead. It shouldn't be in the category of action and whilst the trailers showed ""glimpses and promises of knives, swords and a few sensational stare downs"" thats where the action ends. It was actually very well paced for the first half, but there is a scene in which the movie comes to a grinding halt and never recovers. It is a movie about redemption, father & son relationships and Mr Six being a man of principle which is rarely found in today's society. It was beautifully shot and acted, but shame what started out promising so much at a decent pace ended up grinding to a halt and delivering none of the action it promises in description or in the trailer."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Epic, of a slow burn kind of epic which does not rely on empty coolness. Unnecessary long, but which I did not regret having seen (while I would like to get back the time lost with the super cool, super empty, super onanistic exercise of style of Hateful Eight). It has does not excel in any aspect, it is no unforgettable masterpiece, but it touches all the right chords, with its imperfection, with its mah moments, but steadily, with no hurry, no noxious Hollywood bullying narcissistic superiority.Do not let you fool by the synopsis. This is no ""Taken"" (thanks God!). It is not ""if you will not let my son go I will find you and I will kill you"". There is no trace of the typical American megalomaniac testosteronic super-cool hyper-heroism. There is just ""an ordinary citizen"", who totally ordinary is not. Because he can teach a few values, although he is an ex gangster.And I am not old enough to complain about the society of ""today"". But I felt it very real, his complaints, the portrait he gives of our empty times...I am having a hard time finding good movies. Stupid comedies, depressive drama, empty boom boom, hyper-sentimental moralistic bonbons, hyper-sadistic horrors, hyper-intellectual blabla... It seems that our society faces a severe lack of contents, and must put loads of extra sugar, extra salt, extra oil and energy, following the motto of Advertisings, ""if you have nothing to say, say it loud"".Whatever I watch, it is boring. This was not."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Not an action movie by any means but an interesting drama concerning traditional values versus new free-market attitudes seen from the perspective of an older criminal element trying to deal with the new-money, corruption-based variety.The movie does a nice job of showing community life in the laid back old hutongs that still exist in Beijing and while the plot is a little slow it develops well. Since this film was designed to appeal to a domestic audience a lot of the nuance will be lost on foreigners. It emphasizes relationships, loyalty and honor in contrast to the quest for individual wealth, power and exaggerated regard of face. It also reinforces the notion that you can trust the Party to do the right thing but not the police.Some ask ""what's happened to Chinese cinema?"" I guess the answer is that it is booming and delivering a wide variety of product. If you want a big budget action film with lots of CG you'll find it in Mo Jin - The Lost Legend. I enjoyed Lao Pao Er more though."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"In ""Mr Six"", we see the urban life of modern day Beijing; we see how some of its older resident (Lao Bei Jing) are struggling to adjust to the rapidly changing city; we see strained father -son relationships put under even more stress by the accelerated generational transition. But most of all, we see an aging anti-hero, well past his prime and caged in by values deemed old- fashion and unsuited for the new world, trying to set himself free. The main characters are as much as Mr Six as the city of Beijing itself. And both the film's director and Mr Feng, the director-turned-actor who played the leading role, did a good job in portraying both."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"The atmosphere of nostalgia is good, and the male performances are good. Unfortunately, the plot deviates from reality, the rhythm is protracted and loose, and there are no ups and downs. It is inevitable that such morality and rules will be eliminated by reality."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"The film tried its best to give the audiences a good taste of real Beijing. Beijing was the Capital of the most powerful empire for about 500 to 600 years. The old China was invaded and then developed by the Party. Somehow something haven't been changed in this historical city -- people keep all their promises and strangers trust each other.Everyone behave morally so that regulation and laws were almost not useful. But culture changed in recent decades, the new generation learned a lot from the outside world and people become materialistic and greedy. The thing that is commonly appreciated today is love between lovers. While 2200 years ago Confucius educated every Chinese that people should always love each other. So that everyone is trusted, everyone's feeling is being considered. It is an idea towards an idea world.Mr Six is a man having warm heart to everyone, it is like love to everyone, he kept all his promises but still he got hurt by the current world. By having Mr Six dead, the film want us know that good things,especial trust between people, no matter it is about Beijing, about China, or even about western world, are dying."

老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"A so-so movie about some Chinese old farts who failed to adapt themselves into the ever changing, rapidly deteriorating environment and social structure in China, especially the horrible turn-out of Beijing. This film signed up the famous and controversial director as the leading character, an old fart that got nothing to do everyday, but hold and hanging a bird cage, walking around to deal with some injustice happened daily in that part of the Capital. An old fart who had a dark background and history when he was young, a widower with a rebellious son who didn't respect at all but despise him. The animosity and misunderstanding between father and son finally clashed and tested when the young one involved in a trouble, and his old fart father had tried to solve it with his old but die-hard rigid moral principles originated from his mobster time when he was young.The whole movie was stretched too long just for the purpose of allowing these Beijing old farts to deliver some wise-cracking dialog that made the old Beijing people so self-important and so self-pompous, considering themselves a notch higher than the other people living outside of the Capital city. The wise-cracking dialog had stretched so thin that sometimes really needed your patience to sit tight to watch. The storyline and the scenarios involved lot of unnecessary sub-plots to patch up the whole somehow very hollow and weak story. It totally relied on this actor/director to deliver most of the pointless dialog. At first, the leading character gave you an impression that he indeed could talk the talk and walk the walk, but then, suddenly his obnoxious attitude and his toughness surrendered to his physical conditions, with heart disease. An old fart, tough with his mouth but scared to death to surgery and the small scalpels to be used in his surgery.The storyline later turned out to be more ridiculous when he tried to meet the gangsters from the other side. So pretentious gestures in his preparation before the final encounter: shaving his hairs, putting up an old green military long coat, long boots and then, taking out a Japanese Katana, riding a bike through the Beijing streets, with an escaped ostrich aside all along.....These, are all parts of the prolonged to the extreme unnecessary scenes, so overly contrived to certain unbearable limit. And then, what we got is nothing but mucho thunders, not even thunderbolts, albeit rains.This movie is just too Chinese to be appreciated by any other country's viewers. Even to the Chinese who did not grow up in Beijing would have a quite tough time to sit through the whole nine yards if the dialog in Chinese didn't keep interpreting with ( ) to make them understandable. A very contrite and pretentious, sometimes even quite shallow movie. Not too bad, but definitely not great either. Watchable, but need some patience to sit through."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"This is wanna be Old Boy but is flawed on so many levels. Ridiculous plot, silly acting and completely hamfisted attempt at trying to convey old school honour vs the decaying corruption of youth in modern day China.So bad..."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Chinese director Hu Guan joins my favourites list. In 'Mr Six' he created my favourite aging action character. A 60-year-old with respect in his community holds onto his strict principles as he tries to rescue his kidnapped son. That sounds as simple as 'Taken' but that would be like saying the moon is next to me. It's strong statement on the inequality of generations. It's flaw was the final scene needing to be shorter but otherwise an epic crime drama. It's disgusting that the New York Times gave it 4/10. I give it an 8, backed up by the 24 awards it won in Asia, including several festivals giving it Best Movie honour. It's appalling that it earned $1m in ticket sales in the USA versus $139m worldwide. The world has changed so much the past 5 years that I doubt that injustice would've happened if it had been released this year. I will seek his older 'Cow' and look forward to 'The Eight Hundred'later this year, coronavirus permitting."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Another movie where a way of life adds just as much to the tale itself .Honour above all else for the main character , as simple as it is difficult for all to achieve .Great movie a must watch really . Recommended ."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"An era and an era are bound to change, and everyone in the era is changing, rules and rules are bound to conflict. Maybe the rules of this era and those of your era have changed dramatically. Maybe you are not compatible with the world, but you are still the greatest father and the best brother in the world. The most impressive thing for me is the scene of LiuYe's going to the ice lake war. The perfect match between the voice and the camera, a man holding out his favorite army green coat, holding his favorite broadsword lens and the camera lens, has achieved a shocking effect. FengXiaogang is LiuYe, LiuYe is FengXiaogang! Give a person a feeling for the directness of a role. Old cannon is one era and another."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"""Even in a fight, there are principles.""Watching with a Chinese friend, he explained the important social issue which Mr Six highlights - the rapid development and urbanisation of China over the past few decades means that the old, more traditional China is juxtaposed with the modern, changed China. This is an issue many elderly Chinese face, particularly in Beijing where you can visually see it when finding traditional buildings in amidst ultra-modern skyscrapers.In the movie, Mr Six - a 'gangster' leader in his youth, but also a man of principles - remains well- respected in what's left of old Beijing. He struggles to come to terms with a city he hardly recognises anymore, and must deal with the new, young gangsters who lack any and all principles. It's quite deep and Feng Xiaogang does excellent in the main role. The movie is well-known for it's heavy use of the Beijing dialect, which is very rarely seen in such large proportions in cinema. Main weakness of the movie was the last 20 mins of the film, which was a bit weird. Other than that, very good. Even Kris Wu was OK. Would recommend."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"This movie is really a cultural thing and it's for the people that grew in Beijing. Gladly, I am. Even a lot of Chinese people can't understand it since it contains a lot of Beijing dialect. As a guy born in Beijing and lived there for 15 years. I can't understand all the dialect in the movie. So it is impossible for foreigners to have a perfect experience on this movie since the dialect is the part that makes it a good movie (unless you're really good at Chinese and actually lived in Beijing for many years).Although I admit there is some bad acting choice or bad filming, but it is a realistic represent of those Beijing ""Lao Pao er"". It appeals a lot to Chinese. Right now, we're losing a lot of these dialect and culture, this movie is about help us to recollect those tradition.My advise is: Don't watch it. If you are interested in it and going to watch it, take it easy, don't have any thoughts like ""this movie is gonna be amazing"" before you watch it. The target consumers is Chinese (and mainly some of the Chinese). Asking foreigners to truly understand this movie is like asking a man to use a sanitary napkin."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,2 hours to tell Chinese people it's ok to snitch. Great.
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"This is a movie that has nostalgia written all over it. It utilizes elements of the traditional Chinese culture and combines it with modern issues. Essentially it is a tale of redemption between a neglectful father and a broken son, of how people we put down can have their own big story and of how modern society lacks the ""rules"" that define our actions. The themes in the movie were intriguing (corruption, old gangs...), the premise of the story was promising but it just wasn't a well told story. The scenes dragged, the dialogue felt flat at times and all in all the movie easily lost the audience. This could be blamed on the unnatural pauses in the story telling, the weird cuts and mis-en-scene as well as the out of place soundtrack. It felt like the team behind this movie was pushing the 'artsy' tones a little too much and it all came out forced and fake.A good film drags the audience in, makes the audience empathize and feel every raw emotion of the characters. In this film, the character I was moved by one character and it happens to be an unnamed ostrich. Jokes aside, the only female lead was played wonderfully by Xu Qing, the character worked because her actions felt real. The title character Mr. Six was played well by leading man Feng Xiaogang, but I couldn't help but feel he was 2D at times. With cinematography of this standard, and this type of storyline the movie could not possibly attract the attention of the younger population. So, it decided to cast two of the hottest young actors, Wu Yifan and Li Yifeng. Voila! Teenage girls will go crazy! There's one down side though...they can't act! Wooden expressions, awkward delivery...sometimes the performances bordered ridiculous. Yes, there were a few shining moments but all in all the younger characters were a failure. Heck, they even got one of the most popular ""teen idol"" groups to make a cameo! What happened to movies being about acting... The take-home message here is that this is a great idea squeezed inside a small container, it tried to be personal, but it wasn't, it tried to be epic, but it wasn't that either. It seemed like the ending of the film tried to be both...it ended up making me want to retreat into my seat and never come out again."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"I have watch this repeatedly, storyline on point, I recommend this one"
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Surprised at the high ratings as that was a poorly written, vastly drawn out story, super slow and filled with overdone tropes.It was shot cinematically beautiful in many scenes but this failed to add much to the film.The story is bland and the acting is subpar. It felt like a lot of the movie was just flashing around expansive cars that doesn't do anything for the film.This film tried really hard to be mimic movies like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, but fails to do so as the plot/costume/acting just wasn't there.I wouldn't waste time on this movie...there are much better films out there."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"I had no idea what this movie was about or seen any of the trailers before going into this film so it really was quite a pure experience. From the first scene I was looking forward to the story and the rest of the movie.Unfortunately what I experienced instead was a terrible movie going experience that I don't think has been or will be bested. If I wasn't with others I would have walked out about halfway through.What's wrong with this movie? Where do I begin? Scenes that should be short are drawn out for no reason at all. There are shots and plot elements they spend heaps of time on and turn into absolutely nothing. The story is so simple that you could write it in 2 sentences and yet they make you think its some great and amazing thing they have concocted.I think it does appeal to Chinese people a lot though since it has many famous stars in it. But if you look past that and just try to see it as a movie it is truly a great disaster.The worst part of all was the ending. No meaning behind it, extremely forced, no emotion. What happened to Chinese cinema? I cry every time when watching Hero and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Now I have to put up with movies like this. 2 hours felt like 2 weeks.In reality it probably is a 3/10 but since there are obviously so many fake ratings and hype I wish I could give it a 0/10."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"Pretty nice to watch, it mixes both the seriousness and the hardship of a local beijing person's life. The message is strong, the director skills are not bad."
老炮儿,Mr. Six (2015),,2015,2015.12.24,"I have not had good experiences watching movies coming out of the PRC but after reading the description and reviews, I decided to give this one a shot. I must say, half way thru the movie, I had to turn it off. I took a few days off and was determined to finish what I started but there were a few more times where I was tempted to shut this off for good. I'm not sure how people can rate this above a 4. The story, dialogue, overall direction makes no sense to me.The main character is Mr. Six, portrayed as an ex-gangster, rough around the edges, but deep down a decent person with strong principles, or as the CCP put it - ""a regular citizen"". I wanted to like this guy until he started acting in the dumbest, most illogical manner- eg. Running out of the hospital after realizing he has to be treated for a life threatening malady and running away from the woman who's trying to save his life.There are moments, when you think/hope that Mr. Six will say something lucid and deep, but it always turns out to be irrelevant, at times, intolerable, completely destroying any rhythm that was built up up to that point. This continues throughout the movie and I just didn't care for any of the characters, old or young.There is definitely cultural incongruity at play here but I'm not sure the root cause. The choreography of the last battle scene is ridiculous, not in a good way. FYI, there are no actual fighting sequences, just long drawn out frames of Mr. Six slowly walking across the icy pond, and the two opposing sides watching him, until he finally collapses in the middle. Conceptually, the ending is strong (gets 1 star) but the way it is expressed on screen is straight trash."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Based on a novel written by Jiang Rong, the story takes place in Mongolia, with sublime landscapes of the Eurasian steppes and describes the daily life of the natives. One of them will adopt a wolf-cub while the wild wolves regularly ravage either the flocks of sheep or the herds of horses.It is excellently filmed and the film is similar to a naive and contemplative tale for children."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"-Wolf Totem (2015) movie review: -Wolf Totem is a Chinese film, made by the French director of Troy, based on the novel (based on a true story) following two Chinese students staying in a modern (1960s) nomadic group of Mongols who raise horses and sheep. They live in a somewhat dangerous area inhabited by Mongolian wolves, so when a corporate residential manager decides to essentially steal food from the smartest species of wolf on the planet, the wolves are forces to get into a turf was with the Mongolian shepherds. It is like the set-up for The Last Samurai if the samurai were the wolves.-This ambitious endeavor paid off with a massive visual appeal, fantastic production value, and an incredibly emotional story. It was quite a great film.-I'll go ahead and say this, if you don't like animal deaths or tragedy that might come with said true events surrounding the decline of two impressive races, Mongolians and Mongolian wolves, you will not enjoy this film. However, the story is well told and filled with smart writing to drive the point home and beyond. You will get more that you bargained for.-The film takes a short while to really pick up, but it has a good pace for most of the film.-The acting is very good. I do not know any of the actors or wolf actors in it, but the actors did a compelling job and the wolves were so much better than just having stock footage of wolves.-The characters offered a lot to the story. Each character represents a human trait in a way. The main character, Chen Zhen, offers the hope in humanity and the attempt to see the best during dire situations. His best friend character is more of the ambitions, progressive look at those people who just don't care. There is the village leader, who represents the old ways and greatness of tradition. And of course, the sorta-villain who represents everything wrong with change and industrialization.-The music is the best thing about it. James Horner composes one of his best, most beautiful, and most heart-string-pulling scores. It was actually how I found this film in the first place.-Again, the design on the film is visually stunning. Very good practical effects, cinematography, and impressively good wolf training. Fun fact: This project was turned down by every major Chinese director because they thought it too difficult to train Mongolian wolves.-It is an emotionally draining film and the true story makes it even harder to enjoy, but it is truly a compelling, well made, beautiful film that I think is totally worth checking out! -Wolf Totem does not have a rating, but it has a PG-13 amount of violence and language, so I would say PG-13. Makes sense."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"It saddens me that this film will not receive a wider audience. With an English title of ""Wolf Totem"" very few outside of France or China will be tempted to see it, but it is their loss.Wolf Totem manages to bring to the big screen the majesty and mystery of wolves. But it is much more than a National Geographic or Animal Planet documentary. (Although those in themselves would be a great success.) It also invites us into the world of Inner Mongolia and tells a compelling tale of human love and loss. This is not Le Renard et L'infant (The Fox and the Child). It succeeds in telling a much grander tale. The acting is all very believable and unlike the usual over-the-top soap opera-esque fare available in most Chinese cinema.But come for the wolves. I could howl their praises all night long."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"I know the name of Jean-Jacques Annaud from The Bear, a movie that made his name a lot more memorable to me than The Name of the Rose, another movie I loved and that he directed. In The Bear, the main character was a little bear cub and any humans in the film were mere secondary characters. The things that film did with animals was nothing short of miraculous.In this Chinese-French coproduction, there are a lot of wolves and talk about wolves and people getting angry about wolves or loving them, but they are not the main characters. Relegated to the subject of a conversation, wolves play a minor part in this film that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It shows a little bit of Chinese Cultural Revolution, but not enough to be of any relevance or warrant the wrath of Chinese authorities. It shows the free way of the Mongols living in the steppes, but it doesn't go in depth. It shows some beautiful wolves, but most of the time they just look pretty and don't do much. It shows men in love with women, but it never goes into romance territory. It shows city boys being schooled in the ways of the steppe, but it doesn't really make anything of it.The acting was good and so was the direction, I guess. The wide views of the green steppe were beautiful (until the mosquitoes arrived). Yet most of the time is seemed like a fairy tale, lacking a truth that I am not aware of, but that felt like it should be different.It is not that I didn't like the film, but after two hours of going back and forth between genres, alternating between hating the Communist director who doesn't understand the life of the land and hating just about everybody else for their pretentious stupidity, I was actually bored."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Moving and visually stunning autobiographical film involving Mongolians shepherds and wolves, both groups affected by encroaching settlements and bureaucratic regulations enforced by the Communist Party overseers, during the Cultural Revolution in China in the late 1960s. A Beijing university student is sent to live with nomadic shepherds and learns their ways, including their interaction which wolves, which has a spiritual significance to them. When the ecological balance is altered by human greed, there are fatal consequences for both humans and animals.While the photography captures the rugged majesty of the steppes in all its beauty and the action sequences are thrilling, this man versus nature drama portraits its characters with veracity never resorting to superhuman heroics or histrionics. Life is frail for both humans and wolves in their struggle for survival, wolves are not anthropomorphized, the Mongolian lifestyle is not romanticized, there are no easy solutions.Perfectly acted with flawless cinematography, this a must-see films for nature lovers and those who are concerned about the environment. The rest of the viewers should also be rewarded by this poignant and compelling real life story."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"This movie was essentially on ecology, environmental protection and on the dignity of nature and all creation - here exemplified by the Mongolian wolf. The tradition and culture of Mongolian tribes unfolded before the eyes of the chief protagonist, a city boy from Beijing sent to these realms by waves of the Cultural Revolution. The audience followed his adventures and drank in the beauty of the awe-inspiring grasslands, learnt about the (sometimes cruel) facts of life and were drawn into the joys and woes of the Mongolian herding tribe. Fascinated by the wolves, the Han student rashly tried raising a wolf cub. His actions led to unimaginable consequences and irreparable damage as he found himself accomplice to ruining the Mongolian people and the grasslands he grew to love. In the end with a heavy heart we witnessed the darkening destiny of the ""great life"" of the grassland, ever intertwined with that of the ""little lives"" of all life forms dependent on it. The movie tried to portray that there was a faint speck of light and hope with the return of the captive wolf, though it was not really comforting. Fabulous acting on the part of the wolves; with discernible laudable effort and bonding between trainers and the animals. Worth watching despite the unflattering take on humanity and greed, if only for the noble creatures of its namesake."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"This film, in general, is not bad, but the original novel's author is obviously strongly influenced by the Chinese Communism. He glorified the heartless Culture Revolution in last century, and never touched the sensitive taboos of those absolute-NO-NOs indoctrinated by the reigning Chinese Party. What we got in this film is a wonderful Inner Mongolian prairies life. Two displaced young Mandarin men were forced to leave their hometown and exiled to the far and remote Inner Mongolia province, trying to survive for the stipulated 2 years expatriation.The production team of this movie had hired some specialists to train a bunch of wolves to play the main and critical roles of this film. I have also read some of the scandals related to the rehabilitation of those wolves after the film was completed. what I found the most pretentious flaw in this film is the female actors to play the Mongolian tribal women (like the females in ""Spare Parts 2015). They are extremely eye-appealing and cosmetically pretty, yet the truth about the Mongolian females(like the females in ""Spare Parts 2015), most of them are not as pretty as what the movie showed us. The other unrealistic part of the film is the kind faces and the gentle way of talk from the local Chinese Communist Party officials. They looked too civilized and too reasonably kind when treating the Mongolian nomad tribes. The good part of this film is the camera work, the cinematography, it did an amazing job to show us the beauty of the Mongolian wildness, through the lens, it pretentiously beautified the tough livelihood of the local tribes, showed us the wonderful free spirit of those people. But in truth, is it true that the Chinese Communist Party would be that kind? When I watched this film, I have to remind myself that this film was not a documentary film, I had to watch carefully for those phony and false parts of it. When the Chinese Communist Party censors every book, every movie, every TV program, every blog on line, many real things would be carefully omitted and avoided, otherwise, nothing could be released or past the censorship. So it also means that anything that have been approved must not demonize the Party but praise, otherwise jail time and long term imprisonment would be implemented.So don't be fooled by this already heavily cosmetically beautified film, by its beautiful cinematography achievement, by those absolutely unreal Mongolian young beauties."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Short and straight, the movie is beautifully shot and some pretty good actors in the mix.Always pleasant to see different landscapes, gorgeous animals and different cultures.That being said, the movie, from beginning to the end, is a violent documentary on how to mistreat and disrespect these wonderful creatures, with 3 excuses: they kill the cattle, they are worth money, they serve as sacrifices to Tenger, one of the Mongol Gods.So.... all these 3 reasons together seem to be enough excuse to extinguish a race from the face of the earth (at least on their territory).Violence, specially to the wolf pups is hard to swallow, specially if you admire this creatures. It's like a movie about Eskimos killing seal pups just to sell the skins....Word of caution, don't watch this with your kids.I'm sure (and hope) the director didn't hurt any animal shooting this. The violence is cleverly shot to avoid seeing it until the end.... BUT it is there, the action is there, the movie is stained from beginning until the end with pointless acts of violence towards wolves.In the end, a very unbalanced effort, leaning towards gratuitous violence. Pointless, stupid, to the point of frustrated boredom and sadness overall.To avoid, sincerely."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"French filmmaker Jean-Jacques Annaud's China-France co-production is his third enterprise tackling with human-animal equilibrium, after THE BEAR (1988) and TWO BROTHERS (2004), WOLF TOTEM is adapted from a popular semi-autobiographical Chinese novel of the same title and is shot in the majestic Inner Mongolian steppe. During China's Cultural Revolution, in 1969, two students from Beijing, Chen Zhen (Feng) and Yang Ke (Dou) are assigned to the steppe to teach local Mongolian nomads Mandarin and smooth the process of cultural integration. They are under the aegis of Bilig (Mijid), the head of the nomads, a sage mind who inculcates them the precept of the balanced co-existence between mankind and indigenous wolves. But, a pervading human force of greed and self-seeking would soon disrupt the well-maintained balance, wolves are deprived of their sustenance and during one blizzard night, driven by hunger, they attack a horde of horses and result in great casualty, including Bilig's son (although it is an accident). Retaliation is conducted under the command of an apparatchik (Yin), many wolf cubs are perished for the sake of their skins, but Chen saves one cub, secretly raises it like a pet and attachment grows. As often, one considers him or herself doing a good deed would only realise later in the stage it is a mistake, domesticating a feral wolf isn't something worth commending, and it is noteworthy that Annaud doesn't vindicate Chen's behavior by stating that the cub is bereft or in somewhat danger, Chen's behavior is solely out of his own soft spot, with no regard of the consequence for the cub itself, only after Bilig's sensible advice, Chen would right his wrongs to prepare and train the young wolf for its return to its natural territory, and one should remember, it is always a rookie mistake trying to extract a trickle of humanity out of the wild creatures, mutual connection might be able to achieved, but don't belabor yourself with any illusions of any reciprocal gestures. The stand-off between humans and wolves will reach its heroic climax after the ravenous wolf pack assails a sheep corral during one night and this time, the entire pack is almost being extirpated by bullets and unrelieved vehicle chase, witnessed powerlessly for Chen, if anything, powerless is the omnipresent feeling, wherever humans tread, there are black sheep undermining the natural grandeur and harmony, disasters are bound to ensue, a central message cannot be dissipated by the film's lugubriously concocted positive vibe in the end. It is a big relief Annaud doesn't settle for facile wishful-thinking or radical aggression in its tonality, so that the film manage to retain an organic slant which conforms with his previous similar oeuvres. The striking animal stunts orchestrated by dexterous trainer Andrew Simpson greatly hone up the set pieces, especially against its ferocious surroundings (the scenes of frozen animal corpses are manifestations of the primordial power of nature), and it goes without saying the film is a continuous landscape-porn (plus two emphatic examples of cloudscape), although sometimes its immaculateness unfittingly instigates the suspicion of an overachieved CGI-preening during the post-production. The human cast understandably takes a back seat from its awe-inspiring canine counterpart, but the dialogues sound clunky to a Chinese ear, and the character development barely exists, since when Chen and Gasma (Ragchaa), the widow and daughter-in-law of Bilig, become an item? The emphasis is so top-heavy on Chen and his wolf cub, which makes the romantic subplot comes off as abrupt and fluffy. In the main, WOLF TOTEM doesn't shortchange its forte: the spectacular vista and pulsating action sequences, and it also circumspectly bypasses the sensitive political agenda (the film was a mammoth box-office player two years ago during the golden spell of Chinese Spring Festival) and allows the story itself to stimulate reflections on a broader picture: human vs. nature, simply within ecological parameters."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"I have to admit, when I saw the cover I thought this was going to be a documentary. But it's a feature length film and it is a very well shot one. It's about nature, it's about humans and it's about wild life. Especially in the region depicted as someone else already stated well in their commentary to the film here on IMDb.This will not be everyones cup of tea, but if you like nature movies with a dramatic twist, you probably will like this too. You can't compare it to Revenant, which is something I kind of expected to find here, but fortunately that wasn't the case. The movie really brings the animals to life, framing them in a way and shooting them to make them not only characters but someone to root for and feel for too. If you are an animal friend, I don't even need to be telling you this. If not, you might not be as moved as others ..."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"It's 1967, the second year of the Cultural Revolution. Beijing students Chen Zhen and Yang Ke volunteer for work in Inner Mongolia. They are tasked by dictatorial bureaucrat director Bao Shungui to teach Mandarin to the local tribe. Bilig is the respected tribal leader and Gasma is intrigued with Chen Zhen. The tribesmen herd sheep and live next to wolves which hunt gazelles. The tribe takes some the hunted gazelles which are stored by the wolves in the frozen ground. Bao Shungui returns to take the rest. He leads an effort to root out the underground dens and kill the pups. Chen Zhen ignores tradition and keeps one pup alive. Bao Shungui dismisses the local traditional ways and tries to force modernization.This has the vast grassland and wildlife. There are nice vistas. The story is something like ""Dances with Wolves"". It tries for an environmental native story but there are a couple of clunky situations that don't exactly fit. The local tribe is more in tune with the environment but they aren't always easy on it. The lead character Chen Zhen is desperately trying to save the wolf pup but it's not really a good idea. The story does not always work but it works enough."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"It was unprecedented that the film market in China was so prosperous during Spring Festival. Seven blockbusters of different styles were released on the first day of Chinese New Year that created more than 170 million earnings in this 7-day vocation.The box office earnings of whole year in China was only about 200 billion, dating back to last decade when the market was just awake, which was difficult to compare with the data today. In that period, nevertheless, Dadi cinemas picked the digital screening strategy, even though it was much higher cost than film screening, to make the second- tier and third-tier cities that with larger population enjoy fair treatment on watching new movies, and therefore promote the development of Chinese film market. This investment mode of Dadi Media was used to be bantered as ""Quixotic Courage"", what meant the commercial mode was lightly regarded. However, it was dumbfounded that Dadi insisted on breaking high-price barriers and making ticket prices more reasonable for audiences.All decisions Dadi made were depended on the inherent attribution of films that they would be led back to the source -- the public. Keeping the original intention that ""Make movies ubiquitous, make good movies ubiquitous"" in mind, Dadi Cinemas sacrificed immediate interest and contributed to prosperous film markets in the second-tier and third-tier cities, aiming at spreading culture, mind and art of movies, keeping infusing blood with dream into Chinese films. The desire for ""good"" movies in Chinese market was increasingly intense after explosive growth these years. It was comforting that movies during this Spring Festival satisfied audiences' needs for fierce actions, extremely cute and all-age theme. In addition, movies achieve our dreams on showing feelings, conveying the belief and transferring power -- in case of watching the movie Wolf Totem. New perceptions on savagery, humanity, survival, freedom, dignity and faith, will all be found after watching this movie.Indeed, Dadi Cinemas are looking forward a new start from The Wolf Totem, a new start of film art that need to be put thought into it. As a consequence of this expectation, Wolf Totem was released averagely 2 percents more than it occupied the box-office proportion in Dadi Cinemas. During the 7-day vocation of this Spring Festival, more than 460 thousand audiences have watched this movie in Dadi Cinemas in more than 130 cities around China. The germination of Chinese film market has come to this era while audiences discussing ardently about the movies they just watched in Dadi Cinemas near their home, such as Wolf Totem, Dragon Blade, The Man From Macao 2, and so forth.It is reasonable to believe that when more practitioners make sacrifice for the art of film, such as Wolf Totem and movies in the future that belong to film culture, art, this era, and all audiences who love movies, the development of the film market in our country will be inevitable healthy and permanent.Even though the strength of Dadi is possibly not strong enough right now, movies that obey the heart and keep unique style are definitely respected. It is a new step of Dadi, from loving the ""Wolf"" in the Year of the Goat."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"The scenery of Wolf Totem was excellent in a classic IMAX style, back when IMAX was only used to shoot documentaries about wolves versus now when we shoot narratives about them..The action sequences were great as well. This is the third movie this year behind, Max and White God, that actually shows canines battling (This one being with wolves). It amazes me that PETA is not all over these people for showing animals fighting and getting kill in such a real matter. I'm not even a dog lover, but in this day in age it's surprising they do stuff like that on camera.I was also impressed with the human performance of the main actor and his female lead. I could see the passion the lead actor had for the wolf and I did not need subtitles to understand him, very good body language.It was a lovely moving painting."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"A semi biographical adventure-drama from China directed by the French director known for 'Seven Years in Tibet'. He was chosen after many Chinese filmmakers refused to take the project, because of the dedication it required. The film highlighted the outcome of the two ethnic groups, Mongols and Hans overlapping with the mother nature. The film should have been one of the best in the line of 'Siberia Monamour', but there a few things that did not work in its favour.It was just like the 'Embrace of the Serpent', based on a person who went to a distant place with a motive, but learnt another thing. Especially realsing the value of the native people and their land and culture. The main character was totally resembling to the Brad Pitt's role from 'Seven Years in Tibet' and very inspiring. You learn nothing by observing afar, you have to get in and get along to gain knowledge of the place. So you have to be one of them in order to see through their eyes of the place and then would find its true identity.The tale begins in the late 60s during the China's cultural revolution. Two young students from Beijing sent to a remote place in the Inner Mongolia to teach the locals read and write. Instead, one of them gets interested in wolves and decides to study them by raising a cub. During that time, the confrontation between the wolves and for the human encroachment of their natural habitant determines the future of the grassland. The ultimate face-off between them ends with the emotional.""The problem for us Mongols is that our history wasn't written by us, but mostly by our enemies.""When you don't belong to that place, you should not intervene in its natural order. The China's history is always bad when it comes to the land grabbing, either it is the ongoing South China Sea dispute or the Tibet and thousands of others. This is such a film made by China itself that spotlights their wrongdoings. Just see the film to know how much different the Mongolian, especially the nomad culture and the Han-Chinese. They' both saw the mother nature with different intentions. So imposing one land's rule to another does not work and that's the film's most important message.Very sad the film was not realistic since it was based on a real story. Visually it was very good, especially the locations were spellbinding and used so well to tell a story, but the animal behaviours were too silly, something like that happen in the children's stories. Then there's evidence the animals were harmed during making it, so feels uncomfortable in many scenes and I won't advise kids to watch it if they're very fond of the animals. In that angle this film got a completely a wrong motion picture rating. If you are a light hearted, you should as well turn away from it. Because even though they won't show the killings, in a few segment they were just graphics and make-up, but still you are definitely going to feel the pain, very disturbing film.In a few scenes, feels bad for what Mongols regrets for letting the Hans to do all the terrible things to their land despite at one stage of the history they were more superior than them. At least the film ended on a positive note, only because of the alteration in the screenplay from the controversial book. It was originally selected to represent the previous Oscars, but soon it replaced with another to avoid the International humiliation. I think the film was not that terrible, but not being true to the book was the issue. It is very hard to suggest it, it might upset you for the various reasons, so all I can say is choose wisely.6/10"
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"I have read the novel. It was so touching that I shed a lot of tears. Unfortunately, this movie didn't catch or failed to express what the author did in the book. I developed such a deep respect to wolf from reading the book, while in the movie you wouldn't feel a thing. It was such a disappointment. The pictures were good though. But that is all.I went to the cinema with my husband. When the movie ended and we walked out, I asked him 'do you have any love for the little wolf'? He said 'no'. I had a bitter laugh, recalling when I was reading the book, I was hoping to fly out there to do something for the little wolf. The movie failed to catch the essence of the book and failed to help the audience understand why the herdsmen love and respect wolves."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"This movie is based on a semi-autobiographical novel and I think they did a pretty good job in turning a literary piece of art into a cinematic experience. This is one of the reasons I gave this movie 7 stars. Other reasons included great performances (extremely natural and believable), beautiful scenery and the amount of empathy the creatures from this movie were able to develop in me from beginning to end. Of course, all of the creatures except...humans. Ok, you can try to understand them, but if you are a sensitive person you can't help but hate every single character here except the Chinese student who adopted the little wolf. The main character is the only character with a sensitive heart and a pure soul. Yes, there is a little kid from the village, I'm sorry. I studied Chinese language and literature and I spent some time in China while I was a college student, I think this is is a very accurate portrayal of Chinese people, no matter if we are talking about people from big cities or countryside. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a highly sensitive Chinese person. They can be wise and smart, but they are practical and cruel. And I couldn't enjoy the movie. Being a huge animal lover, my heart was shaking all of the time. The scenes are highly graphic, brutal and disturbing. I agree that these types of movies are necessary for us to raise our awareness about many things that happen between men and animals and to try to change and improve the relationship somehow. I liked the ending scene because in a certain way it blended sensitivity with ""coldness"", wild warrior spirit of the wolf was compared with still naive and culturally embedded spirit of the young Chinese student and they did that in a strong and emotional way. (I am not a native English speaker, so please don't laugh if something sounds strange in this review ;) ). All in all, I think that people who really love animals will have a really hard time while watching this movie."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"I am a WOLF LOVER, and for that reason alone I could not bear to watch more after they murdered those wolf cubs!!! It thoroughly disgusted me!!! Sure, in the beginning, the cinematography was very good, and the acting was so-so. I could easily envision the greed of humanity, which is a given, more so in our time, but still valid even then. Watching humans STEAL the very food from the wolves after they worked so hard in obtaining it for their cubs, only to see humans and their inhumanity at work murdering the very cubs the pilfered food was meant to feed. Near the beginning one of the main actors is reading a book about how it's better to be dead than to lack freedom and then he goes and catches a wolf? Again, I couldn't bear to watch man's constant inhumanity to other living creatures! This is the main reason I gave this movie such a low score."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Mongols believes in Eternity of Blue sky and idolizing ourselves us like descendants of Wolf and Deer. Just watched a movie 10 mins ago. Feeling is not excited. We Mongolians never built a castle for sheep.Trying to climb a wall, to kill and then skip away was our history. Sorry, but we let them build Great Wall. If they sending message they saved Le dernier Loup, again sorry. Mongol made history before Mao and it will continue. The movie about a wolf is made best with Grey Liam Neeson, by the way, he made also best movie against rulers with his role in Schindler's list. Watch Grey and compare it Le dernier loup. Sorry I should comment and have al right. Last wolf may be make money but not a best foreign movie to be honored Oscar and Canne.Sorry to say again sorry. Predators were always hunting a weaks, eating babies and surviving though.., survived around here at least 40,000 years. But we didn't aware why we still existed in a land of plenty dinosaur skeleton."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"The so-called Cultural Revolution in China was a socio-political process carried out in the second half of the 60s of the last century, as a way to intimidate anyone who thought differently from what the great chief preached and ordered. This process brought thousands of workers and students to rural areas of the country in order to interact with farmers and shepherds and to promote the thinking of the great leader. Inner Mongolia, a Chinese territory, did not escape of the young people incursions, the so-called Red Guards or Hóng Wèi Bing, in charge of enforcing the indications and goals of the Supreme Leader. That is the value of the film and its subtlety, it addresses an aggression to the ecosystem, including its natural fauna and how local and outside entities react to a problem created to solve supposedly another. The film highlights when the laws of nature are not considered, and adverse rules are imposed, which finally may bring about the extermination of species and biodiversity. The wolf is a predator at the top of the food chain and as such is an ecosystem regulator. If the wolf disappears, the ecosystem becomes unbalanced and the populations of its prey may grow without limit. The shepherds warned that the rabbit, a pest in that environment, would proliferate and seriously affect the grasslands. A useful film for those who do not understand nothing more than money and nothing about the protection of fauna, flora and the environment in general."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Loved the way this film made, definitely a film that can cross the borders. Still in awe of they filmed the wolf and horse chase. Definitely need subtitles to understand, but the emotion carries well. Respect to the creators."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"Photography apart, this is by far the worst movie I have watched in the last 10 years. The whole thing feels like a clean propaganda machine gone wrong. The only decent acting is from the anthropomorphized wolves as long as the hold the pose. Human actors are just plain bad, make up is theatrical, and stunts, when not part of a circus show are short of convincing. One could summarize the movie in a few words: Nature is beautiful and balanced, man destroys nature. Do we learn anything ? nope, that is the way it is, I am going back to China. I think it is time for a green eyed Jean Jacques Annaud to ride a shinny-vintage-museum-quality-tractor-with-clean-tires in the painted sunset."
狼图腾,Wolf Totem (2015),,2015,2015.09.11,"I'm not sure what to think about this movie.I choose this movie by random, and one reason was to see a little of culture of Mongolia. I'm curious to know and see movies which will show different cultures what has happen at different times.There is a beautifull and magnificent landscape views, but also cruel acting againts animals which is hard to watch, when you know people has act like that centuries.Which leave only one question: why?"
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Miss Granny is a 2014 Korean comedy-drama film about an aging grandmother that magically gets a chance to relive her youth.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story: Na Moon-Hee initially stars as the titular Granny. She portrays a woman in her golden years who soon finds herself becoming less & less relevant to the family she helped raised and the world she now lives in. While reflecting on her life on one particularly bleak day, she accidentally stumbles across a means to turn back the clock 50 years. Nothing else has changed with the world, but she's now stuck in the body of her former 20 year old self.The majority of the early part of this film plays like a straightforward drama about the life of a granny and her surrounding family. Na Moon-Hee is a fine, fine actress whose primary job is to set this entire film in motion by portraying the prototypical Korean entertainment matriarch; she's wise and kind and cares for her extended family, but she's also stuck in her ways, nags a lot, and seemingly doesn't have much left to look forward to in life. Na Moon-Hee spends most all of her screen time simply establishing these basic familiar traits & familial relationships, while endeavoring to provide a good deal of viewer sentiment towards the plight of her ever-aging character.A little while in, the change from 70 year old woman to 20 year old girl occurs, and a new actress takes over in the Granny role. Shim Eun-Kyung gets the role of ""Young Granny"" and is ultimately the star of this film. She's dually tasked with playing an adorable young girl from the past mixed with a modern older woman from the present, while frequently having to call upon and blend the traits of both. It's a rather juicy part (for a rom-com melodrama) that is crucial to the overall success of this film, and Eun-Kyung does not disappoint. She is very impressive throughout this film right from the moment she bursts onto the scene.Things get pretty amusing as soon as Young Granny shows up and starts to realize what has happened to her. After some initial shock, then acceptance, she quickly gets busy taking full advantage of the opportunity at hand; Young Granny moves right back in with her family under the guise of an anonymous young boarder, and sets off on completing a proper 'Fantasy To Do List' (i.e. go on a shopping spree, join a band, find romance, etc). After soaking in all that her newfound youth has to offer, and avoiding detection as long as possible, Young Granny has to eventually choose between continuing on as a 20 year old or reverting back to her older self. And, this being a Korean film, there's probably going to be some melodrama involved with her decision.All in all, everything falls into place quite well with this little flick. It will occasionally meander along from one set piece to another, but everything is kept moving along expediently enough. All of the auxiliary characters were relevant and solid when called upon and there are no real antagonists to speak of to get in the way of things. This movie does tend to play like a mostly lighthearted Korean fantasy TV melodrama that's condensed and edited up into a 2 hour format, and, it is shamelessly sweet and sappy whenever it gets a chance to be so. But, it's also occasionally poignant & quite charming overall, and, it is often freakin' hilarious once it starts to heat up. The film does benefit considerably from a combination of several stellar performances and some sharp writing/editing/direction when necessary. And, perhaps this film's biggest attribute lies in its own ability to be somewhat self-deprecating; it often seems to delight in chiding a number of well-worn genre specific themes and common industry motifs, while simultaneously embracing many of those very same aspects in order to produce a simple, fun, & entertaining movie.Summary: I've seen far better films this year (from Korea and elsewhere); more original films, more exciting films, more important films, etc. Nevertheless, I can't think of too many movies that I actually enjoyed more than 'Miss Granny'. It's solidly recommended no matter who you are or where you're from, but, you'll most definitely get more mileage out of it if you're a fan of &/or are familiar with the Korean entertainment industry to begin with.Bottom Line: I Loved It!...8 out of 10 stars!"
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"It is amazing how cleverly written the story is. From start to finish the situations and scenes are so delightfully put together. The ending is touching. Compared to some age transfer comedies like Big and 13 going on 30 etc, Miss Granny is the most enjoyable and entertaining and makes full useof every scenario and familial and romantic relationship in the plot. The lead actress does a charming job and the supporting cast are well cast too."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"""Miss Granny"" is a funny, sweet and compelling drama that would bring joyful feeling during seeing it. Actually the movie is far from perfect, the theme is kind of weird and illogical but wouldn't bother much if audience could deal with it. The storyline itself isn't focus between reaching the dream, family relationship and love story, it would feel like watching drama series in one film. Also there are some plot holes and questionable ending. Luckily all that flaws could be covered by hilarious and heartfelt moment. The jokes really work especially after Oh Mal-soon becoming young again. It's a unique yet convincing performance by Eun Kyung Shim as a young lady with granny personality has delivered a non- stop laughs. Overall ""Miss Granny"" is an average good Korean drama which offers entertainment and happiness, but it's still been miles away on being excellent."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Its been a long time I didn't see any good comedy from Korea since ""How to Use Guy with Secret Tip"" (2013) and ""All About My Wife"" (2012). This movie is so good! About an old granny who turned out to be 20 again and its so funny to see how she manage to handle the unexpected miracle ever. Korean young actress, Shim Eun-Kyung plays the role so well as a young woman who acts like a granny. Although everyone keep whining about the plothole in this movie but this movie works. It can make you laughing out loud and also can make you crying like a baby. This movie is supposed to be an easy movie with an interestingly catchy premise. Maybe its a culture different since some audience feel weird why there is a lot of character here speak so loud. You will understand if you have watch a lot of korean movie. By the way, the song is so heartwarming and its make me want to buy the soundtrack now. Don't waste your time anymore, just watch this movie. The best korean comedy so far in 2014."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"I didn't think this was a laugh out movie in my opinion. But it kept me entertained throughout. This has most of the formulaic elements for a Asian comedy, but for the most part it actually works. This takes on the what if scenario, of what a granny would do if she got her youth back to when she was in her 20's. Sure a lot of stuff is far-fetched and the dialogues not completely believable. But for a comedy such as this, it still works out when you think about it. Eun-kyung Shim did a good job for the most part impersonating a granny, although some parts can be rough around the edges. But that actually makes this movie work for the better in a sense. This is a inside joke movie, where the audience knows what is going on but the characters have no idea. But like I said, most of the formulaic elements work. The thing is, everyone wants a second chance to accomplish the things they may have missed out on after realizing. So for teens, they can get a good laugh and adults can get some amusement out of this because they can be able to connect. However what matters is to let go of the things you can't change and do the best you can in the present.7.5/10"
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"I have just come home from the 2015 Korean film festival here in Budapest, and I want to tell you this film was a resounding success. It had everything and more: good story, creative script, good music & songs, good acting, good pace, hilarious humor. Already in the first 2 minutes it conveyed such a heart-felt lead-in that I knew I had made a good decision to give it a try.All throughout the movie the audience - including me, of course - had a ball! We breathed with the film, laughed our guts out and simply marvelled at the freshness and at the style of the dialogues. I think I want to travel to Korea to see whether they really have such lively relations to one-another, way beyond the virtual emptiness we experience not-so-rarely in the western world...To sum it up, this movie is a must! My rating: 10/10. Period."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"A Korean comedy-fantasy. One of the most admired senior actors by me from the Korean film industry is that Na Moon-Hee. So far I have watched some of her films and loved all of them. The title says it is her movie, but she did not stay much longer as the script demanded replacement after the opening few minutes.If you know the movie's synopsis you will understand that it is a theme kind of switching back to younger ages. Yes, like the movie 'Big'. In her parts which were the opening portions she put a great performance. After that, the young 'Sunny' girl took over the role and led to another level of entertainment filled with music and fun. Her performance and expressions were so good like her previous movie.''That's why I want to take a photograph now. Before I grow more ugly.''As we know, the concept was too old, but the story wasn't, especially if you are a regular Hollywood movie viewer you would know that. But, surprisingly, this movie was enriched mainly because of the Korean flavor with the usual melodrama and a little cliché at some point. It was not a special movie and offers nothing new if you are familiar with Korean films. Because they applied usual Korean movie style of fun to present the story. The story was kind of predictable and that does not stop you from getting entertained.What fascinated me about this movie was the end. The solution at the final act was well designed to fit for a movie with a concept like this to end in a better way. And further, a clean open for a possible sequel generates eagerness among the viewers if they had liked so far of the movie. It is nothing more than having a good time, which offers a little inspiration about our dream and family value. A good Korean movie, the family type movie, but everyone can enjoy it.7.5/10"
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Such an amazing feel good film. I laughed out loud, actually cried at one point and enjoyed it from start to finish. All the actors are wonderful and really portray a story that is believable from start to finish. Basically, a grandma gets a chance at life at 20 and ends up singing for a band. Because of who she is, she brings quite an original awkward style with her and it works. Shim plays the role superbly and it's really hard to believe that she was just 20 when she made the movie last year. She's a serious comedic talent. I look forward to seeing her go far. I even just downloaded the soundtrack, it's a keeper. Enjoy."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Excellent acting by lead actress.Surprised to see rating 7 for this movie, this movie deserves atleast 8.Brilliant screenplay, kudos to the director"
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Except for a little bit of stupidness in a couple of scenes, this movie is near perfect. Eun-kyung Shim is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. There are several remakes of this which while good are not as good. I believe this is the original.Few movies flow like this one. Flawless editing, directing & near flawless script.There is something truly for young & old to enjoy.The premise might seem like a tired & overused theme but the way its treated here is fairly unique. its also more thought out than similar scripts. and again must state that Eun-kyung Shim plays the part so well you always believe she is the grandmother. I laughed & cried.After watching a second time, its just as good as the first time. Though it has subtitles, you almost don't realize it because the acting is so good."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,Miss Granny was a great idea that was implemented in a very watchable way. I wanted it to last longer because the story really drew me into it. Eun-kyung Shim was convincing in her role as a young granny. I'm not sure if she was singing or lip syncing but the voice had impact and was a pleasure to listen to.
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Miss Granny is a very light fantasy movie wrapped in comedy. Nothing so special about the story line or theme, but, good to watch with some pretty good moments."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,I started it not expecting much but it was actually good i had fun watching it had many laughs too.Even though movie was 2 hours long i still wanted full explanation of what happened before the one year later events.
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"I, as usual, love how korean movies incorporate good writing, whatever the story is. And Miss Granny adds one more aspect to it: cuteness."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"Another clever story from South Korea that would resonate with most Americans. Clean and funny. Musical numbers are listenable. Storyline somewhat raises the difficult question faced by so many families: Are retirement homes really the best option? The story went several unexpected directions, which will keep viewers guessing about the ending. While there are a few plot holes near the end, they get buried and forgotten by several really huge waves of emotion."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"I heard that ""Miss Granny"" was remade in Japan, China, Vietnam and Thai, and going to be remade by Hollywood, so I thought that I have to see the original. Actually, it was awesome and I thought I want to see over and over again. The tempo of the movie doesn't make me bored at all and the heroine has charm and humor, so it was attractive. At first, it was a kind of comedy, but the latter part, made me sob. The situation that senior turn into a young lady is not realistic, but I easily accept the situation and I couldn't take my eyes off it. Also, I have seen the heroine in another film, but I didn't even imagine that she is also good at singing. It became one of my favorite movies."
重返20岁,Miss Granny (2014),,2014,2015.01.16,"A feel-good movie; sentimentally sweet.I would have had them both go to the mystical ""Photo Shop"" and drive off happily ever after!The music was pop and it was a tear-jerker when the son talked to her before giving blood."
有一个地方只有我们知道,Somewhere Only We Know (2019),,2019,2015.02.13,"Finally, an Asian love story that has real depth and sincerity. I want to thank the writers for a well crafted experience that left me pondering long after the final episode all the different ways of being in love there are.The actors were awesome. The chemistry between the two lead actors was intense. They both should have huge write ups on IMDB. My only complaint, and it's one that I find with all of the Asian love stories, is that there's always one plot line where over-acting threatens to ruin the whole thing. Thankfully in this case, that sub plot resolved itself and the over acting went away.And thank you writers, producers, for the ending. Two great guys/men - I was rooting for each of them, one before the other, but in the end, she picked the right one."
有一个地方只有我们知道,Somewhere Only We Know (2019),,2019,2015.02.13,"I loved this drama as it just nosedives into story and then builds on developing the character. The chemistry between lead actors is so good and even side characters have interesting personalities. I think the synopsis presented everywhere does not do justice as its not exactly a teacher-student relationship as described and the way relationship between lead actors develops is not weird. at all. Overall a great watch. The only reason I am giving it a 9 because ending does get messy. Character of male lead wasn't developed as much and why he was the way he was. There is a special episode to bridge the gap that is mostly devoted to male lead and answers a lot of question. I just wish they had taken time to do a season 2 and develop rest of story. The only plus is that its not a cliff hanger and ending does have a closure, but with season 2, it would have been perfect."
有一个地方只有我们知道,Somewhere Only We Know (2019),,2019,2015.02.13,"One of the best Chinese drama I ever watched. The story is simple, it depicts reality and the ending is sweet. Highly recommended. The characters are brilliantly highlighted."
有一个地方只有我们知道,Somewhere Only We Know (2019),,2019,2015.02.13,"I swear to god if Sir Mu (aka Juck Zhang) doesn't come back and kiss Xue Tong, I'm keeping my one star rating. (I'm on episode 20 so you have 4 more episodes to redeem yourself)"
有一个地方只有我们知道,Somewhere Only We Know (2019),,2019,2015.02.13,"Started out nice: deep and less of a caricature than other Chinese shows I've seen. This was soon blemished by what I saw as drama for the sake of drama. Several plot points seemed to appear out of nowhere and then go away, never to be mentioned again. If that had been all, I could have accepted the show as simple though enjoyable, though it wouldn't have blown me away. Sadly, it ended up feeling more and more like it just wanted to jerk the audience around to get emotional reactions, all of which felt unearned. I want complexity and artistry. It failed the former in its depiction of ""good"" and ""bad"" things happening with no real implications or commentary. The latter is a little harder to assess, but I would argue that the lack of anything groundbreaking or ""whoa moments"" just bleaches the stained tapestry that is Du Jia Ji Yi--you end up with just a blank shroud of what could have been a good work of art."
失孤,Lost and Love (2015),,2015,2015.03.20,"This film will put shame to about 98% Chinese movies which were and have been blindly churned out so crazily every year from China. A great film that has deeply moved me endearingly. The most important ingredients that would make a movie so sublimely great did not just rely upon one thing. First of all, the screenplay writer must write it out of his own heart with passion, empathy and having the realistic experience as a parent. So this screenplay to me is a perfect one, and when a good screenplay became a reality by a director who was also that screenplay writer, then the movie got a very good chance to become a great one. So now we got a good screenplay, a good director who was also the screenplay writer, the next important ingredient to make it maintain the goodness was to find right and appropriate cast to make the screenplay become more real and alive. Here again, Andy Lau was approached to play the main character, a father lost his son and had been on the road for over 14 years looking for his kidnapped son.Here, I have to admit and confess that before watched this film, Andy Lau to me was not a great actor; I often considered him as an over-blown, overly hyped actor without great talent, his images in so many movies were not impressive, albeit a bit pretentious, an actor became famous and popular simply by accident and by luck. But after this film, watching him played this role with his heart, mind and soul; with his micro expressions and his body languages so exquisitely genuine and so natural; with the great make-up works, attire/costume; his natural-grown salt-and-pepper hairdo, his thistle mustache and beard...his screen image was so perfect that had deeply moved me for the whole ongoing from start to the end. A great Oscar worthy performance that only a few Chinese male actors could have reached and achieved. Andy Lau had redemptively gifted himself to finally become a true great actor. Congratulations, Andy! You've finally arrived. As to the young supporting actor, Boran Jin, who also had proved that he is an up and coming great young actor to be watched. The only thing that I am not quite sure about his role in this film is his way-too-white teeth. A country boy and motorcycle repair young guy, an often depressed young man who knew deep down in his heart that he was a kidnapped person, a guy with such deep loneliness and sorrow, did he still get the urge to brighten up his teeth so unbelievably white? Maybe likely but to me, highly unlikely.Beautiful camera work! Through the great eyes of the master camera man, we have wonderfully experienced the beauty of China, on the road, an artwork wonderfully done.Also, very nice soundtrack. The supporting music was just right, very tentative, very sublime and very reserved, accompanied every shot of the film with subtlety, not exaggerated and not pretentious. A wonderful supporting ingredient for a great movie, usually not done quite right by lot of movies.In summary, this is a great film, a notch higher than ""Dearest"" in the same genre and subject. Watch it."
失孤,Lost and Love (2015),,2015,2015.03.20,"A series of interconnected stories attempt to shed different perspectives on China's child trafficking phenomenon in novelist- turned-filmmaker Peng Sanyuan's 'Lost and Love', the second film in six months (after Peter Chan's 'Dearest') based on the pressing social matter. On one hand, there is Andy Lau's Lei Zekuan, an Anhui farmer who has been on the road on his motorcycle for the past 14 years in search of his lost son. On another, there is Jing Boran's mechanic Zeng Shuai, who was abducted as a child and has been searching for his birth family since.In addition to Lau and Boran, there is also Ni Jingyang's grief- stricken mother, whose 18-month-old infant was recently abducted at a busy traffic intersection. Besides handing out flyers to pedestrians, she spends her time hanging around the same intersection hoping to get a glimpse of her daughter. Interestingly, Jingyang's character isn't given a name, but there is no doubt she is intended to represent the shock and anguish of countless parents in the days and weeks immediately after their children's disappearance. And to a much smaller extent, Sandra Ng plays her daughter's kidnapper, driven by money to partake in such a heinous trade.As well-intentioned as the multi-character narrative may be, it is quite blatantly clear just where Peng, who wrote and directed the movie, has her eye on. Indeed, despite opening with a ripped-from- the-headlines story of the abduction of Zhou Tianyu, that arc involving her mother and her kidnapper never quite goes anywhere, so much so that it winds up being an unnecessary distraction that comes literally to its own watery end. Unsurprisingly, Peng spends most of the screen time developing the fraternal bond between Zekuan and Shuai, whose dynamic becomes the movie's emotional anchor.They meet after Zekuan gets into an accident en route to the Wuyi Mountains and Shuai offers to fix his bike for free, thus beginning a poignant relationship of two kindred souls united by circumstance. To Peng and her actors' credit, neither overplay the sentimentality, allowing their bond to develop slowly but surely into one of gentle but unwavering support. In one of their first scenes together, Shuai blames Zekuan for failing to look after his son, but in one of the later scenes, it is also Shuai who pulls Zekuan away from his washed-up motorcycle on a beach after being thrown into the sea. Theirs is a relationship of complements, culminating in Zekuan's pivotal role in Shuai's eventual reunion with his birth parents. Between Zekuan and Shuai, it is perhaps surprising to note that Shuai is the more compelling one. Indeed, though much has been said about Andy Lau's gritty performance as the grieving peasant parent, Peng dedicates more detail to her other character, whose desire to be reunited is tempered by ambivalence at what life awaits for him after that reunion, especially because of his emotional attachment to his adopted parents as well as his older step-sister. An excellent sequence typifying this has Shuai relating his adopted father's wish for him to marry his step-sister, just so he can remain in the family legitimately. Such moments illustrate the psychological dilemma facing such individuals, particularly if they have since settled into better lives in their adopted families.In contrast, Zekuan remains a frustratingly opaque character. Other than his own admission to Shuai that he is afraid to go back to his family empty-handed, there is no other insight to the man who has dedicated more than a decade to such a singular mission. In some of the earlier scenes, Zekuan mounts a banner of Tianyou on his bike to aid in the latter's search, but that act of kindness is never quite expounded into anything substantial. In fact, the second act pretty much sidelines Zekuan as the focus shifts to Shuai's unlikely reunion, leaving only an epilogue involving a group of Buddhist monks in meditation to bring our attention back to this obscure figure. That is also a consequence of Lau's own unexceptional performance – much as it is a departure from the usual 'superstar' roles he is known to play, his acting is convincing without ever being moving. Lau and Boran do have a good rapport next to each other though, which makes their scenes together much more engaging than that of Lau alone. Since we are on casting, we might as well add that the decision to cast comedian Sandra Ng in the role of Tianyou's kidnapper comes up to no more than a gimmick – ditto for Tony Leung Kar-Fai's cameo as a kind-hearted policeman whom Lau meets on his way to Quandou.As a reflection of the reality of child trafficking, Peng also fashions her film like a road movie, with Hou Hsiao-hsien's regular DP Mark Lee Ping-bin providing some stunning images of the rugged beauty of the Chinese hinterland. In many ways, her pacing also follows that of such a journey, which for the most part is leisurely, picking up only in the more interspersed dramatic sequences, such as one where Zekuan's goes on board a floating fishery on a tip that the family's adopted son has a similar scar to that of his own child. That isn't a bad thing in itself, but it does mean that those looking for a more propulsive narrative like that of 'Dearest' will probably be quite disappointed.No matter that it is coming out so closely to Peter Chan's film of the same theme, Peng's 'Lost and Love' has a lyrical quality that its predecessor never aimed or attained for. Alas her decision to have a multi-strand narrative ultimately makes the film seem scatter-shot and somewhat lacking in momentum, and the fact that most of her characters seem under-developed only reinforces that sentiment. Though it isn't as emotionally powerful as it could have been, there are genuinely affecting moments within, and gives voice to a phenomenon that pleads for wider social redress."
失孤,Lost and Love (2015),,2015,2015.03.20,"Watch this cuz the news in 2021 that the dad found his son finally. For the movie, its very moving for the act that the dad drove miles away to find his lost son. The root cause is really the absent minded of Chinese old way thinking that boy is better than girl. With the policy of more child in mainland China, hope such human trafficking of kids could end finally. This movie is filming in a lost son dad perspective, another movie called ""so long my son"" is from bought son dad perspective."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"A huge movie star gets kidnapped for ransom and the police must find him before time is up.At first I though the movie was going to be similar JCVD, and it does have elements of that in the movie, with Andy Lau playing a actor who could have easily gotten himself out of the situation he was in if he was one of the characters he plays, but instead he's stuck in a house with a series of men who, though love him as an actor, seriously mean business.I loved the relationship Lau has with a fellow kidnapper. As Mr. Wu, he attempts to keep up his Star power persona to make him more claim. It was brilliantly done. For the most part, the movie was about the crime unit assigned to find Mr. Wu with the missing person's clock ticking. The guy who they got to play the leader of the kidnappers really took over the screen. it was all about him, and he made an impressive villain to watch. Overall, I have to recommend this police drama. Impressively done."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"The kidnapping of prominent TV star Wu Ruofu outside a bar in Beijing's Sanlitun district may not have made much headlines here in Singapore, but it was big news back in the Mainland, not least because his kidnappers had identified themselves as police officers prior to snatching him but also because it raised alarm about how safe the capital was and led to a consequent boom in the private security business. It isn't surprising therefore that the real-life story would become the subject of a movie in itself, one which writer-director Ding Sheng approaches with the utmost commitment to authenticity.Yes, despite casting Andy Lau as Ruofu, Ding strips all vanity off the Hong Kong superstar by putting him in handcuffs and binding him up in heavy iron chains most of the time. To top it off, a pivotal moment at the end has Andy Lau strangled by his kidnappers using a thick red plastic-insulated wire around his neck. It is harrowing to watch all right, and you can trust us when we say that there is no doubt watching it unfold that it was re-enacted for real. Notwithstanding, the rest of Lau's restrained performance – and we mean this both physically as well as metaphorically – is just as compelling, especially how he balances humility, dignity, selflessness and raw fear in equal measure.As tempting as it may be to call this Andy Lau's show, he is surprisingly upstaged by Mainland actor Wang Qianyuan, who plays the kidnapper Zhang Hua. Those familiar with the case itself will know that Zhang Hua was no less than the mastermind of Ruofu's kidnap, and it was he who had rounded up a crew in search of their latest victim barely two weeks after he had similarly held the younger brother of a gang boss for ransom and assassinated the former after collecting the money. How much of a resemblance to the actual criminal of the same name is anybody's guess, but Wang is mesmerising to watch as the cold- blooded criminal who had run rings around the detectives in charge of the case and who displays no sign of compunction up till the very end.The actor-character transformation is even more remarkable considering how this is the first time that Wang is playing the villain, whose television personas are diametrically different from his role here. Wang more than holds his own with Lau, especially at the start where both are testing each other's limits while trying to achieve their own objectives – one to stay alive, and the other to keep the former alive just long enough to get his demands. Combining a keen cunning demeanour with disarming charm, Wang keeps his audience on edge guessing just what his unpredictable and increasingly unhinged character has up his sleeves. The way Ding structures his narrative also inevitably places the focus less on Lau than on Wang, which unfolds as a race against time to figure out where Ruofu is held before he is executed by Zhang Hua's henchmen.Though Ruofu's kidnapping right after he leaves a nightclub at the end of a business meeting with a potential film investor kicks off the movie, Ding uses Zhang Hua's questioning by lead investigators Xing Feng (Liu Ye) and Cao Gang (Wu Ruofu) as a frame to fill in the events that follow immediately after Ruofu is taken. The framing does make for an interesting juxtaposition, such that Ruofu's physical predicament is mirrored against that of Zhang Hua's, who is strapped tightly into a chair with iron rails around his body and feet chained to the floor in the police's interrogation room. It is Zhang who fills in both the police – and us – with what went down in the 18 hours Ruofu is taken, and from whose point of view the story develops.Adopting a non-linear narrative may be slightly disorientating at the start, but Ding's choice not to simply follow chronology actually proves an inspired one to lend the story greater heft. Indeed, while Ruofu's kidnap was more spontaneous than premeditated, what isn't coincidental is his kidnapper's felonious behavior, and Ding goes even further back than the night of Ruofu's kidnapping to shed light on just who both Ruofu and the police are up against. Assuming editorial control as well, Ding keeps the pacing tight and gripping even as he goes back and forth between different time periods to fill in the chronological gaps.Speaking of tension, those looking for the sort of bombastic action from the typical Hong Kong contemporary action flick should be warned that there is hardly any here; instead, much of that tension comes from a careful calibration of the dynamic between Ruofu and his kidnappers as well as that between Zhang Hao and the police, and which Ding manages to sustain pretty much from start to finish. Ding also keeps the mood taut by filming the proceedings on hand-held cameras to bring his viewer up close with the actors, lending the whole picture a gritty and intimate feel especially since many of the scenes take place within closed quarters.Coming off 'Police Story 2013', 'Saving Mr Wu' finds Ding Sheng at his creative best, fusing the instincts he had starting honing from his debut 'The Underdog Knight' with a fascinating real-life story to create a riveting crime thriller. We won't speak for those familiar with the subject matter, but those with little knowledge of the ins and outs of the case will find this as engrossing an introduction as any, brought to vivid life by an assured directorial hand and outstanding performances from Andy Lau and Wang Qianyuan. In fact, we dare say it is probably one of the best Mainland films you'll see this year, one that by both theme and genre also makes for a welcome change of pace from the usual crop of romance or war epics that we are frankly just exhausted of."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"It's realistic (quite sadly) that someone dressed in police uniform can get away with much, and we see that here where a top notch movie star is kidnapped in such a manner. Actually, it is based on a true story and the actor who suffered this fate appears in the movie!This has ""Hollywood remake"" all over it, and already I can imagine what Hollywood would have in store for a remake. Kudos to the producers of Saving Mr. Wu for making a taut thriller that stands on its own. The ending was quite poignant and kind of a redemption of sorts. The movie start sort of made peace with his kidnapper so that was good to see. Saving Mr Wu is worth watching and if there's a DVD actor's or director's commentary then that would be worth listening to for sure."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"I regard this film is somewhat a remake or tribute to Akira Kurosawa's Tengoku to Jigoku (Heaven and Hell) - a detective story of a kidnap that depicts the detectives, the kidnapper and the kidnapped (though for the former it is the father of the kidnapped that is the main character).With both being shot in semi-documentary styles (the film is actually based on a true story in China) and focused on the investigation procedure, it is the kidnapper in both that steal the show. Ruthless, relentless and with hatred for the society, both are ready to do anything for money. Lau, who played the victim in the present film, even with good acting and a script tailored-made for him, actually overshadowed by the kidnapper.With the case slowly reviewed, the evils of present-day 21st century China are also reviewed. The use of apple as the main source /key for solving the case is a nice human touch to a very depressing and inhumanistic story and make the key message more in line with the Chinese official (i.e. criminal listen you rip what you sow) or the cause and effect Buddhist philosophy.All in all, despite its conventional tone, it is a good film with a good acting, good script and good cinematography all round and a positive message for the folks of a socialist society that turn more materialistic and capitalistic day by day."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"In recent years, the movies produced from China have become more and more ridiculous and shallow, the screenplays were either ridiculous or stupid, the acting of all the characters were more pretentious and exaggerated. Lot of profiting Chinese on-line media companies also jumped on the money train to produce more and more superfluous and hollow films targeting the teenagers or low level TV viewers. Strong influence from Korea also polluted the self-respect and self-dignified of the younger generations in China, more young men looked more feminine and more look-alike the Korean young men, with forehead fully covered; young female actors(if we could tolerate their poor acting talent)look more and more like women in escort business. Pointless wedding scenes became the main course, love scenes, lovers' quarrels or misunderstanding scenes became the main scenarios and the plots. Shooting locations must be either Italy or France with lot of unrealistic story lines portrayed Chinese young men, especially young women living abroad. More and more scenes of passenger airplanes taking off or landing, so the airport terminal departure and arrival scenes also became part of these movies. Then night time party scenes also a must have, scenes of the Chinese young and old characters, male or female binged imported Italian or French wines also became must-have scene. Every female characters, heroines or supporting all looked like models, wearing expensive clothes, driving expensive imported foreign cars.....on and on, endless repeated again and again formulaic scenes, plots and scenarios, same crap, different titles. Then another genre mainly targeting the shallow Chinese viewers I.Q. and logic also polluted the Chinese copycatting movie industries: 99.999% pure ridiculous, clueless, pointless, stupid farce-like movies started to pest the Chinese screens. They completely misunderstood the definitions of ""Comedy"", they thought by throwing in all the ridiculous scenarios and plots, by allowing the actors doing the stupid exaggerated acting were the indispensable and must-have in their so-called ""Comedy"". And these above-mentioned stuff have become the total ingredients of the Chinese movie and TV industries.Another part of the Chinese media industries also become the mouthpiece of the totalitarian Chinese Communist Party. They rewrote the historical record and document, invented so many unorthodox and untrue incidents to praise and kiss the Party, changed the Chinese history to brain wash their younger generations, injected falsified and blind patriotism, national hatred to the Japanese and dislike of the totaled Nationalist Party.While these are the factual outcome of 95% of the Chinese movie and TV productions. There almost nothing worth watching enough, the tiny 5% portion of them are trying their best to do the good and doing their might to maintain the sanity of the Chinese. And ""Saving Mr. Wu"" is rightly among the small 5% rare species.This movie at large is good and serious, but the randomly edited and patched time sequence of the story line, scenarios and the plots suffered huge set back. The formulaic but randomly linked and arranged time frames were like a drunken frog jumping around with no logical sequence. The leader of the kidnappers also fell into the formulaic type of a farce-like comedian character. By acted and performed like that kind of criminal attitude, there was no way that he could become an Alpha dog but more like a typical American stand-up comedian with gifted and crafty wisecracking dialog. A criminal imprisoned for 10 years with teeth so clinically white was a terrible overlook by the actor and the production part.Luckily, Andy Lau and those guys who played the police force have not been ruined by the partly unconvincing formula, they were serious, and Andy Lau was more serious in his sincere and complete believable performance as the victim of the kidnap case.But the self-thought-to-be-correct and self-righteous directing and the editing had jeopardized this film to reach being a premium drama. The poorly assembled time sequence, the hourly patched scenes, the dragging stupid last rescue plan and the unbelievably ridiculous last seconds rescue were simply naively stupid and shallow. Those overly dramatized scenes, the randomly poor patched jump-around hour this hour that sequences, and the unconvincingly exaggerated comedian-like acting and the overdone smart dialog of the criminal leader inevitably downgraded this film to a just OK thriller. And the curly hairdo of the criminal leader, then suddenly became regular straight prison shortcut hairstyle was another careless poof of this at least still quite watchable 90% serious Chinese film."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"I was given the chance to sit down to watch the 2015 ""Saving Mr. Wu"" (ak ""Jie jiu Wu xian sheng"") here in 2020, and seeing that the movie starred none other than Andy Lau, of course I jumped at the chance to sit down to watch it.Granted, as I hadn't even heard about the movie prior to sitting down on the couch to watch it, I didn't know what I was in for here. So I will say that writers Sheng Ding and Alex Jia had every opportunity to impress me with this movie.However, while ""Saving Mr. Wu"" was watchable, I have to admit that I found the movie to be really slow paced and tedious. For a crime movie of this sort, then not a whole lot of excitement was going on throughout the course of the movie. And it made the movie feel unfathomably long and very slow paced.Sure, if you are into crime stories where the storytelling is the main aspect of the movie, one that is driven by a thoroughly written plot and realism, then I suppose you'll find enjoyment in ""Saving Mr. Wu"". However, for me, this movie was just a mediocre crime movie that offered very little entertainment for me, aside from Andy Lau's performance. But then again, he always delivers good performance, so there's that.I wasn't impressed with this movie, and I was ready to give up on the movie two times through the ordeal. The first time I was at my rope's end was around 45 minutes into the movie, and then again at around 70 minutes in. It was seriously an ordeal and a struggle to sit through the movie. But I did manage.My rating of ""Saving Mr. Wu"" lands on a very, very bland and mediocre five out of ten stars."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"Andy Lau's Mr. Wu gets kidnapped by some criminals and the police will try to find him before the bad guys kills him. Will they find the place where he is being kept at before time runs out? Will he be able to free himself?The story of ""Saving Mr. Wu"" is simple enough. Rich guy gets kidnapped, and the police will try to save him, while the criminals try to get the money, and who knows, maybe get rid of him instead of releasing him. The plot is simple enough, but the movie keeps jumping back and forth in time, non-stop, to make things more interesting. It never becomes confusing, though, which is a point in favor of the direction and the plot. Everything that happens is pretty easy to follow and the tension is kept almost thorough the movie.The look is dark and gritty (a little bit too much), the direction is good and never goes for flash and shocks, and the acting is good, with Lau being as good as ever. However, the movie lacks punch and grit, it goes for the safe, and lacks something to make it stand from the pack. It is easy to watch, and entertaining enough, but the story could have offered way much more."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"""Ding sets the sights on rendering the film a cinema vérité patina with frenetic editing, veridical setting and whip-panning immediacy, but the police procedural seems sloppy and too efficient, though Liu Ye is laudable as a diligent police vice captain who knows his stuff. Hemmed in by a noble fidelity to the facts, the game of cops and robbers is one-sidedly expedited, the thrill of the chase is deficient, and suffixing a fictive eleventh's hour rescue can only do a disservice to the dictates of fidelity, we all know the denouement, why bother?""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"This is a 6.5 for me, A gang of kidnappers abduct a movie star for ransom. This isn't an unusual plot. It's not an awful film but it's missing something. I think that it might be a lack of character development. I never really got a feel for some of the characters and it kept me from investing much into what was going on. If I were to pick the best thing about this it would have to be the villain. The actor playing the villain did a great job playing the callus criminal. He totally had me hating him.So, while I enjoyed the film, it was a bit flat. Glad I checked it out."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"The bandits are brilliant, the others are ordinary. There are loopholes in the plot from the beginning. But the timeline and the plot are all right. It doesn't look messy and boring."
解救吾先生,Saving Mr. Wu (2015),,2015,2015.10.02,"Saving Mr. Wu is a suspenseful drama inspired by real events. It tells the story of a movie star named Wu who gets kidnapped by criminals pretending to be police officers. The kidnappers then force him to ask a friend to pay a ransom for him or else he would die after twenty-four hours. In order to survive and give another kidnapped man some hope, Wu uses his wits to get to know more about his kidnappers, put himself in their shoes and find a way out. Meanwhile, the police is tracking down the leader of the gang as time is about to run out.The most interesting element about the movie are the conversations between Wu, the victim, and Zhang, the leader of the kidnappers. The two empathize with each other to a certain degree and develop a certain type of code of honor, based upon honesty and respect. The film also has a quite sinister atmosphere as it mostly takes place at night and in small rooms. An interesting sidenote is that the man who was actually kidnapped in real life has a supporting role in this movie which makes this movie quite authentic.On the other side, the movie fails to truly stand out and leave a mark despite the interesting characters. The film sometimes loses itself in lengthy and repetitive conversations instead of adding some pace and urgency. The way the story is told doesn't help either since the movie starts with a sequence that actually takes place towards the middle of the film, therefore spoiling half of it and making the whole plot quite predictable.To keep it short, Saving Mr. Wu isn't a bad movie and worth your attention if you like tense dramas with profound antagonists and protagonists. The story is too predictable though and the filmmaking sometimes tedious. Watching this movie once is an overall entertaining experience but it simply isn't memorable and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"As well-intentioned as his inspirational youth cycling drama 'To the Fore' may have been, we'd much prefer Dante Lam's character-driven yet action-packed cop dramas 'The Stool Pigeon', 'Beast Stalker' and even the under-appreciated 'That Demon Within'. It should therefore be relief to his fans that Lam is returning to familiar territory with his latest, based upon the Chinese government's response to the real-life incident often referred to as the 'Mekong River Massacre' in which a special narcotics investigation was assembled to enter the Golden Triangle to arrest the notorious drug lord Naw Khar and his compatriots responsible for the killing of 13 Chinese fishermen and crew on board two merchant vessels. And true enough, Lam does not disappoint – not only does 'Operation Mekong' represent his return to large-scale hyper- kinetic action cinema, it is his most ambitiously action-packed movie ever and will quite likely be one of the best action movies you'll see this year.True to its title, the focus is on the covert operation led by Captain Gao Gang (Zhang Hanyu), a no-nonsense hard-nosed anti-narcotics officer handpicked by the Home Affairs Minister. Except for an opening prologue that tells of the devastating impact of the drug habit in Chinese society and introduces the Golden Triangle as a key producer of the narcotics, there is no attempt at social commentary. Nor does the film try to portray the politics involved, aside from mentioning the multi- national task force that was set up among China and the three aforementioned Southeast Asian nations in the days following the massacre to conduct joint patrols of the Golden Triangle and the titular river. Whether to avoid becoming propaganda or risk becoming a flashpoint in complex geopolitics, Lam and his four co-writers steer clear of the vagaries surrounding the unilateral move by the Chinese government to sanction its officers sent under the guise of the multi- national task force to bring the criminals to face trial back in China than in any of the other countries.Brought to the fore (pun intended) instead is the intricacies of the operation, as Gao's elite squad teams up with locally based intelligence officer Fang Xinwu (Eddie Peng) to identify the location of Naw Khar's base deep in the jungles of the Golden Triangle Special Region. That entails trying to rescue one of Naw Khar's men Yan Taung Pha responsible for setting up the deal that led to the massacre, which inadvertently exposes Xinwu's informant Gong Chai; when that fails, posing as a rich businessman looking to use Naw Khar's drugs to complement a new casino venture; and by doing so, getting closer to Naw Khar's inner circle, in particular his son Naw Htuu, to extract that crucial piece of information in order to apprehend Naw Khar. Each one of these three new leads is opportunity for Lam to stage a high-octane action set-piece (with impressive direction by Tung Wai) – first, a breathless foot chase through a claustrophobic market and a busy train station that turns into a jaw-dropping car chase complete with gunfights and RPGs; then, a shootout in a crowded mall which ensues in mass chaos and a tragic outcome for one of Gao's men; and finally, the all-out assault on Naw Khar's jungle lair that culminates in a spectacular boat chase along the Mekong River. Lam's insistence on realism, whether in terms of sets or props, ensures that every one of these elaborate sequences looks, sounds and feels real and thrilling. Coupled with that is his flair for build-up – prior to the mall shootout for instance are gripping parallel theatres of events, one led by Gao masquerading as businessman Mr Qian meeting Naw Khar's number- three Ya Ta and the other led by Gao's man Wenfeng trailing the bag of money used for the exchange – which accentuates the tension and sheer white-knuckle suspense of each major sequence.Compromised in the process is character detail or development, which frankly is somewhat of a pity. The most we learn about Gao aside from his solid leadership of his team is through a few occasional scenes where he looks at videos of his young daughter and one where he shares with Xinwu that the tolls of his job have led to his divorce years earlier. Xinwu gets a tragic backstory with Xing Deng which leads to questions about his ability to remain objective during the operation, but that little history hardly builds to anything compelling. The rest of Gao's team are defined only by their unique skills as well as by their Greek God-code names. There are also no shades of good and evil here, such that Gao and his men are uniformly heroes whereas Naw Phar – depicted as an over-the-top villain who snorts heroin and laughs when his child soldiers blow their own brains out playing Russian roulette – is unquestionably to be despised.There is never any doubt that Lam has set out to make a wall-to-wall action movie, and on that count, he succeeds tremendously. Mind you, this is not some Hollywood B-movie, but one where every gunfight, car chase and explosion is choreographed with panache, adding up beautifully to a single movie that has nary a dull moment. Unlike his peers who have taken on similar subjects (such as Johnnie To in 'Drug War' or Derek Yee in 'Protégé'), Lam isn't taken so much by the fallouts of the drug business or its victims – notwithstanding the brief nod to the limbless villagers punished for disobeying Naw Khar's orders – as he is on the complexities and minutiae of the clandestine operation that helped bring to justice one of the biggest criminal kingpins in the Golden Triangle. If you accept 'Operation Mekong' on its terms, you'll find this one of the most exhilarating movies of the year, an accomplishment which cements Lam's reputation as the foremost Hong Kong director for big-scale action cinema."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Note: Check me out as the ""Asian Movie Enthusiast"" on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies.In October 2011, the 13 crew members of two Chinese cargo ships were shot to death on the Mekong River, which runs through the Golden Triangle, and a large amount of metaamphetamine drugs were recovered from the crime scene. The Chinese government dispatches an anti-narcotics task force to the area to investigate. There they team up with an intelligence officer for a dangerous mission that takes them deep into the lawless jungles of the Golden Triangle and the lair of a ruthless drug-lord.Now although there are a handful of protagonists here, two of the actors really step to the forefront, get the most screen time, and carry the film from start to finish – Hanyu Zhang and Eddie Peng. Hanyu Zhang previously appeared in films such as ""The Taking of Tiger Mountain"", ""Special ID"", ""Bodyguards and Assassins"", ""The Message"", ""The Equation of Love and Death"", and ""Assembly."" The thing I like most about this actor is his screen presence. He has a very commanding presence that keeps you engaged. With regard to Eddie Peng, I just covered him last week while reviewing ""Call of Heroes"" – so it's nice to see him in this one as well.One criticism that I've read regarding this movie is that the story and character development are rather thin. I would agree with that criticism. The structure of the film basically goes like this. The narcotics unit gets ""intel"" about one of the drug lords, or someone who is associated with one of the drug lords, and they immediately take action. Sometimes, it's an infiltration and undercover sting – other times it's an extraction (or pseudo rescue mission) that takes place in a hostile area. These infiltrations and extractions may last anywhere between 10 minutes to 30 or more minutes of screen time, depending on the complexity of the particular mission. But in-between the missions, our protagonists basically do nothing but get ready for the next one. So there's really not much time for adding complexity or depth to the characters.But with that said, ""Operaton Mekong"" more than compensates for this flaw with its blistering pace and action set pieces.The action design is mostly gritty and diverse, with an emphasis on urban apprehensions and special ops strikes that involve gunplay and hand-to-hand combat that does get quite violent at times (there are a few intense scenes involving children and oppressed villagers). This creates a sense of thrill and suspense even though it does get unrealistic (especially in terms of how much damage our two heroes can take). This is definitely neat stuff, incorporating some creative equipment and technology, as well as one of the coolest dogs in recent memory. The dog in this movie – I think his name is Bingo – is awesome, and his usefulness contributes a certain creativity that you don't see in many action movies. And the sheer quantity of action is significant, meaning that things move at a very fast pace.A few other positives I'd like to mention: There are some beautiful natural environments, as well as some great overhead shots of various country locales. International conflict and cast are also a nice mix.This is a no nonsense crowd-pleasing action from Dante Lam, who previously directed ""The Beast Stalker"", ""The Stool Pigeon"", ""Beast Cops"", ""Fire of Conscience"", ""Unbeatable"", and ""To the Fore."""
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"As a foreigner I find it always difficult to watch an Asian movie. Even with subtitles, what I am used to. It's because you can't make anything about any word they say. Even if it they would speak about ""McDonald's"" for example you actually would not hear that world out of their mouths. Besides of the linguistic barrier I saw some pretty good Asian movies. This one is full of action, and if I have to be honest the action scenes are really good. The filming of those action shots are of high quality. The story itself isn't bad either but to me it was just a bit too long to stay concentrated for the entire movie. There are a lot of characters, a lot of action and a lot of fast speaking that doesn't do any good to the movie. But it's okay to watch once though. Just for the good action scenes you should give it a try."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Action scene well done. Full of thrill and tension all the time. You won't get bored since there are different fight scenes with variations. The plot is somehow simple. Well, I would say most action movies are not focused on weaver a complicated plot. The patriot of main characters serves its purpose, yet a bit more depth would be nice.Some of the reviews are quite judgemental and not based on the movie per se. If we see all movies as somehow a Propaganda then all American movies with heroes in it will fall into the category. Since when does IMDb cares about politics rather than the movie itself? This is kind of disappointing."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"In my opinion, this movies is comparable to Star War or Expandable 3. It is based on a real story: 13 Chinese cargo ship members were murdered on 10/5/2011 by the drug lord in the Golden Triangle. It took the undercover anti-drug several years to penetrate the drug circle. It reveals the dark side of the drug gang, where they use kids as soldiers for suicide bomb and control them by drug. I just saw the first show in the U.S. yesterday. You won't be disappointed. Plus, every Chinese should see this movies.There was a police dog name ""XiaoTian"" was very smart, brave, and he died at the end trying to protect the lead cop for the operation. Also, there are several undercover agents got killed during the operation. It is one of best films I have seen in years. It is much better than Expandable 3 or Star War."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Yeah, right, i could say this film was indeed based on a true incident, but the dramatized scenarios and the plots were totally gone astray, making the whole film only with very shallow face value, full of non-stop actions and nothing more. Lot of production budget was invested on these endless firefight scenes, but in the end, it just turned out to be a messy film with pointless outcome. I have to ask during and after watched this film: What's the point? You threw in so many and so much resources and manpower just wanted to get one big drug trafficker, lost so many highly trained guys in order to get certain targets, did such wastes really worth it? Saving face or seeking justice for what? The usual problem of the Chinese films is they're full of patriotic slogans, ""We have to let our Chinese citizens get the real fact and truth, no matter what!"" The stereotyped instruction that the higher ranking officers or bureaucrats give to their lower ranking guys is always stupid non-sense: ""Be careful, watch yourself, no matter what we have to sacrifice, we have to get this guy."" That's why You always see a scene in Chinese movies when a guy climbing up a ladder, the others down there always telling that climber with a WTF instruction: ""Be careful! Don't fall down!"" WTF!? This stupid must-have dialog and scenes in Chinese films is like what we usually see in the Korean films: The actor always talking to himself or herself of what he or she was thinking during that moment. The typical Korean movies always with such stupid monologue, actor(s) talking to himself or herself in order to let the audiences know what he or she was thinking and in the meantime, explaining some part of the story-line.Lots of stunts and special effects in this messy but pointless film. One of the reviewers gave this film a low rating just because it's not quite accurate or true to the real incident. I have to disagree to this reviewer's comment: Movies are always dramatized, they usually got some ideas from a true incident, but not always had to follow the truth or fact, otherwise it would only become a documentary; because only documentary films have to follow the truth and should not be dramatized. But this film was a completely dramatized commercial film, so it didn't have to be exactly like what really happened. But fair is fair, there are things in this film that need to be complimented:1) The stunts carried out by the Thai stunt specialists in this film is top-notched performance. 2) The chases in the streets, the gun fights in the mall and elsewhere, the close combats, the explosions, the atrocity and cruelty of the drug organization...all the special effects were carried out spectacularly well, almost seamlessly. The logistics and the synchronization were pretty maturely thought through, shot and edited nicely. Thai actors are great in doing these again and again.3) The cinematography, the handling of the camera lens, the shooting angles of all settings were great. This film has the touch of the three ""Expendable"" films and those ""Rambo"" franchise films. The camouflage uniforms when the Chinese Special Force wore to invade the drug lord camp were a wrong choice. They should wear the green ones instead of the purple browns ones, those uniforms just exposed them so well. We looked at the screen, all of them stood out like sore thumbs. Also, the dialog among the Chinese somehow still felt weak and contrite.If this film could have omitted those cliche Chinese patriotic slogans, those big words about what they did were purely for their country and the Communist Party, then I might give this film a 9."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Initially, the film is a bit confusing, but you soon get to know the characters and once the introduction is done, the film starts making perfect sense. The film features beautiful cinematography and incredible action sequences, with impressive photography during these action scenes.'Operation Mekong' is filled with intrigue, suspense and action, making it the perfect action thriller. As an added bonus, the film is visually stunning. There are a few disturbing images of kids using drugs, though. The film is fast-paced and there never really is a dull moment.The film's main antagonist, Naw Khar, is unfortunately an undeveloped, weak character who doesn't really contribute much to the movie. The film's climax would have been so much better had he been a stronger character. Nevertheless, this is an incredibly entertaining film."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,I might don't know anything about the event in which Operation Mekong based on but what I do know is even when it a propaganda movie that glorify China about how righteous they are for seeking justice for their people by turning a foreign country into a battlefield it still a pretty damn awesome movie to be honest.The characters is likeable and each action set pieces stand out in its own way.The movie is all for a good 2 hours of braindead action so do not take it seriously
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"This film is intended to be a nationalistic exhibition and exultation of the mighty prowess, fortitude and ingenuity of their Special Forces. Instead the film portrays a bunch of inept and amateurish 'military' personnel--with Greek mythological figures as nicknames no less--lacking real leadership, conviction, training, and strategic experience in undercover and covert operations. This film would probably appeal to the uninformed simpletons. Anyone with any type of military understanding would find this film laughable and appalling. The filmmaker really did a disservice and insulted every member of the PRC military--along with the 13 Chinese victims, the real life casualties. They must be cringing if they could see this shameful account unfolding like a Mickey Mouse escapade. Instead of what potentially could have been a great showing of national pride, this film is just an embarrassing foray into the shoot-and-blow-them-up genre. If you're into that type of films, then this one is for you."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"OPERATION MEKONG is another blistering action thriller from Chinese director Dante Lam, with the definite emphasis on the 'action' quotient. Although overlong, this story about Chinese special forces battling drug lords in the Golden Triangle, is basically a string of massive set-piece battles strung together with the usual character melodrama in between. It's a light and enjoyable thing, occasionally cheesy with the sometimes obvious use of CGI and green screen effects, but one which gets by regardless thanks to the sheer number of big, bullet-riddled action set-pieces. There are chases, fights, and shoot-outs throughout, seemingly inspired by the Stallone flick RAMBO with blood clouds everywhere. The cast is a bit sub-par, with not enough old-timers (although Ken Lo's turn is a highlight) and a few too many newcomers like the average Eddie Peng, but the film is designed to offer spectacle and entertainment and that it certainly does."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Very good movie. Start to finish action thriller. Wondering about so low ratings. Story of a mission of four nations against a dangerous drug mafia backgrounded at Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and China. Beautiful camera work with eye-catching photography of wood areas, valleys of Mekong river and surrounding. Story seems realistic not so sophisticated as other Hollywood movies based on a real event between drug mafia and police war which took 13 lives of China commando and a Police dog too! There are no big name in actors or no one is so powerful that story moving around him. A tension full climax will definitely impress you. Thrill, action and tension makes you bind till end without taking a sigh of relief. .No space for boredom here. I recommended this to them who love action and thrillers. Must watchable. It is pity for such good movie to see low ratings. It worth 8 or above. Me gives 8 stars and 1 extra for fascinating & classical outdoor photography."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Before downloading this film I knew nothing of it. I very quickly looked on this site & Wiki, decided it seemed alright. After spending a time getting subtitles to this film, I knew this was a film night I would have to pay more attention (subtitles). I actively paid all due for the first five minutes. My attention turned to rechecking and actually reading my previously go-to sites. All information was polite, glowing, short. The first review here is an insight. It is so rapturous in it's love of Operation Mykon is so saccharine I have turned this from a 4 star review into a 3 star one.Just because New China can bankroll this kind of simulacrum doesn't mean we should all look. This film would be at home, back in the late 80's"
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"5 stars only because of the first 5 or 10 minutes, which were well done. Anything after that, with the exception of the final moments is absolute and total nonsense. It is said in the end that the film is based on real events, and true enough, the very basics of the story are correct. That is that 13 Chinese sailors were murdered, and drugs found on them. Who murdered them remains a mystery, but there is a good chance it wasn't the men executed for it. The movie purports to tell the official version agreed upon by the Chinese and Thai governments, but it fails at it too. The action scenes are unreal, like the ones you would expect from a grade B American action film. The green screen in some places was more than obvious thanks to bad lighting. What was supposed to be a jungle in some places is clearly an artificial forest. The men who are supposed to be speaking Shan are speaking Thai. There's also the issue with some of the characters that are very out of place (their ethnicities wouldn't per it them to become drug lords)Finally, the antagonists are all depicted as crazed men who train kids high on drugs to be soldiers. Without any spoilers: absolutely unreal. The real life drug lords of the Golden Triangle supported their communities to gain their trust and help when needed. They build schools and clinics and were called fathers. This film is bad, twists a real story unil it's unrecognizable, and is just badly done!"
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Well made action flick. lots of great action scenes, lots of beautiful shots, and some great music. but the story was sloppy with too many different moving parts, including some that seem unnecessary. i would love to watch just the action sequences again (1 viewing)"
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Operation Mekong is a crime action movie directed by Dante Lam and stars Zhang Hanyu, Eddie Peng and Vithaya Pansringarm.The movie is based on 2011 Mekong River Massacre.The movie is said to be based on a real life incident but instead of keeping the movie close to the reality the movie is been made more dramatic to please the viewers, with some good action scenes and good acting the movie could've been a great movie but is been spoiled by over dramatization due to which the movie looks another normal action movie.We have seen many war or action movies inspired by true events such as Dunkirk, The pianist and saving private Ryan and these movies are being termed as great movies because the makers had tried to stick to the originality of the story, there are two ways of making the movie either you make a good movie by sticking to the original story which not only will make the movie beautiful but also great or you can twist the story to make the movie look more dramatic or crowd pleasing movie, in this movie the director decided to choose the second option. The plot looks modified as the movie is also been turned into revenge drama as one of the lead character is taking revenge of his dead girlfriend, another character is taking loads of bullets, guns and even bombs but still survives, the dog has to die to earn the sympathy and infuse emotions in the viewers and so on.For the first 25-30 minutes the movie looks great but as soon as the movie progresses it becomes more of an another action movie, the movie is undoubtedly has superb action scenes, some great camera angles and beautiful cinematography.Acting in the movie is superb and I have to admit that all the characters had put in their best for the movie, screenplay of the movie is fast paced and will keep you engaged, action scenes are just great and in fact amazing and the action in the climax is superb.Overall the movie is said to be an a movie inspired by true events and although the operation Mekong was carried out by China, Burma, Laos and Thailand jointly but this movie looks more of a two men job, the movie is not that bad and is one of the biggest successful movies of China but I am disappointed as I am a fan of movies based on true events but the movie is looks more dramatic and fictitious. Action lovers will surely like the movie."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Operation Mekong is yet another contemporary big budget patriotic action thriller from China such as Wolf Warrior. The message is quite clear: if Chinese citizens get into trouble anywhere on the globe, the government is going to intervene and bail them out. In this particular movie based upon a true event, a group of thirteen Chinese sailors get ambushed on the Mekong, are brutally murdered and framed for drug trafficking. A group of perfectly trained special police forces cooperates with institutions from the Golden Triangle to capture and bring to justice the drug lord behind the attack.This movie convinces on many levels. The locations in China, Thailand, Laos and Myanmar are particularly exotic and the hidden villages in the jungle and the gorgeous shots of the Mekong are truly fascinating. The fight scenes are intense and the ones taking place in a shady building complex where the team tries to rescue a potential witness are absolutely stunning. The movie also includes some really tense moments such as the risky negotiations in a Thai mall. The characters are interesting enough and especially the police officer who lost his girlfriend to a ruthless drug trafficker and has been looking for vengeance ever since is quite intriguing. The film convinces with great pace and is entertaining from start to finish.There aren't too many things to mention on the negative side. The story is somewhat predictable. The film takes some time to introduce all characters and get properly started. The underlying propaganda message leaves a bitter taste but comes along with most Chinese action movies these days.In the end, fans of dynamic action movies in the key of Hollywood's Rambo franchise and the likes should certainly watch Operation Mekong. The special effects look great, there is a healthy dose of tension and the locations are truly interesting. The story might not be innovating and the propaganda elements wouldn't have been necessary but you will get two hours of spectacular entertainment. If you like this film, you should also watch the similar Operation Red Sea released two years later."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me captivated throughout the entire film.The cinematography was really top of the line. Some directors take daring chances to use unique camera techniques, and they don't always pay off, but the camera shots & CGI in this movie were done masterfully.The story was very good, and the fact that it was based on a true story makes it even more of an enjoyable film. Everything came together for this to be a great movie. Great acting, great set design, great wardrobe, great writing, and great cinematography. The realist portrait of the criminal underground within the Golden Triangle region of Southeast Asia was a real eye opener.The film takes the viewer through dark back alleys, open city streets, busy shopping centers, police stations, jungles and onto the open water which helps keep the viewer captivated."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"From the film point of view, it can only be moderate, the story is clear, the action is in place, special effects are not dizzy. Of course, as the main theme movie, at least it won't make people sleepy."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"This movie deserves a better rating for many reasons :tribute to old american thriller genre : one can see reference towards The deer hunter, Scarface or the godfather... But this is not a copycatnot only A Michael Bay type of movie : Yes, there are lots of explosion, and the chinese governement and army were involved in the process, But Dante Lam got more talent.Political incorrectness, that left HollywoodDeep script, where I discovered the interactions between China, Thailand and Myanmar to fight against their drug issues with the Golden Triangle.This movie is built as a videogame : and this is for me a good point.And finally no, this is not a propaganda movie (that could explain, i guess, the bad rating) the cop methods are not as straight as american ones, and the heroes end jaded for example."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"I gave this a 10 because there was so much good action.The cinematography was awesome, special effects are as good as it gets.Only downside I can see is it is subtitled and that is ok, it took away from me reading and trying to follow the action at the same time, I just cant get over how well this movie was done."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Whether it is the anti drug version of ""outwitting Tiger Mountain"" or the national propaganda film, good-looking is the last word. From Tsui Hark to Lin Chaoxian, Hong Kong directors are becoming smarter and smarter about how to combine action elements with national policies, which is a good momentum. After watching it, an aunt nearby lamented that it was not lost to American blockbusters at all. Such films were not only exciting Chinese films, but also exciting."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"I have not only seen the spirit of Chinese soldiers to carry on with heavy load and forget their lives in order to safeguard the national dignity, but also the spirit of brave responsibility and the national integrity of a big government to safeguard the national image and protect the life and property rights of its citizens."
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"Its a very beautiful film. Beautiful action scene, beautiful cast,"
湄公河行动,Operation Mekong (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"The real incident is very cruel. 13 Chinese compatriots were killed innocently and cruelly. Under the leadership of China's police, Myanmar and other multi-national police have been united to arrest the real murderer, and justice has been done for the dead compatriots. On this basis, director Lin Chaoxian adapted his works. Our police and drug dealers fight bravely, even unavoidable sacrifice, in order to get justice!"

从你的全世界路过,I Belonged to You (2016),,2016,2016.09.30,"City Radio talk show host of ""Passing Through Your World"" Chen Mo (Chao Deng)—in China surnames come first—advises people on their problems. A female caller complains of being lonely on her birthday. He tells her she shouldn't be; millions of people all over the world are sharing the same birthday with her. She is not alone. His female co-host (Baihe Bai?) calls it quits (""It's break up."") He helps all kinds of people with their problems. Who is going to help him?After two years of diminishing ratings, nobody will co-host with him  except for one fresh intern Yao Ji (Tianai Zhang) (""I'm Birdie."") For all her self-efface­meant, she manages to ""erupt with unexpected elegance"" when he gets in a bind.His best friend ""Chubby"" Zhu Tou (Yu Yunpeng) after yearning greatly for the prettiest girl in college Li Zhi, seizes an opportunity to help her finish and graduate, earning her appreciation if not out­right obligation.Female beat cop Yan Zi (Liu Yan) spends her days chasing petty miscreants and dreaming of promotion until one day by mistake she chases a nerd Mao Shiba (Yang Yang) whose only contraband was used electronic junk he collected to recycle. In his nerdy way he was afraid and ran on account of her being so pretty. Having similar minimal relation­ship experience, they hook up with each other. He loves her extravagantly (""Such devotion to Yan Zi"") with home­made gizmos and gadgets, which may sound corny, but he really puts him­self into it.Add some financial troubles at the station, a stern female program director Xiao Rong (Dun Juan), and a fading dear mother Madame Liu, and we've got all the makings of a fine drama.The title ""I Belonged to You"" may be misleading in English. The tense of Chinese verbs can be a bit ambiguous, may even have elements of past, present, and future all at once. Maybe the oriental view of time is different than in the west. How­ever that may be, we have in one movie here three couples who will end up, when the credits roll, in a relation­ship either in the past, present or future. The challenge is to figure out which one will be which, and thanks to some clever writing it may not be the ones you expect.""I Belong"" has all the hallmarks of a Chinese drama film. The tears on their occasion are copious, and the declarations of love effusive. It's a triple romance with no mushy stuff. One couple goes so far as to discuss intimacy in a relation­ship, but only indirectly. The callers, on the other hand, are direct to the point of being shocking. The film itself is rated PG in Canada (British Columbia) & Singapore.Chinese is a simpler language than English, so the subtitles seem to go by too fast when you're trying to follow writing that's more complex than the spoken parts. The scenery captured on film is at times breath­taking. There's some brief but decisive martial arts thrown in from a surprising quarter. The male leads (nerd, slob, and fatso) are made to look different enough for a western eye to tell them apart, and one of the women is always seen in a fetching uniform.I'm a Chinese film aficionado to the point of having taken a couple years of Mandarin Chinese just so I can understand the movies better. I just love this stuff. The acting did not suggest any Oscars, to be sure, but it was done well done enough for an enjoyable viewing experience. Some few scenes put the strain on suspension of disbelief, but we were able to pass on them due to the pleasure of the plot. Screen­writer Zhang Jiajia appears fleetingly towards the end of the credits."

The age is never really specified although I would guess at 20 to 30 something. There is amazing scenery including areas of the city and countryside something old and something new. I really enjoyed the whole thing. There are some happy moments, some really poignant moments and some very sad - take your tissues.Well worth a sitting. My friend and I go to the movies most Friday's and try to see art house as well as mainstream. Well done to the Paramount and Penthouse in Wellington New Zealand for making the effort to show the unusual."

我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"Bingbing Fan is on a quest for justice. She and her husband got a divorce so they could get a better apartment, but after the divorce, he married someone else. So she wants the divorce overturned, so they can be married again, whereupon she will sue for a divorce.This confuses the local judiciary, the police department and the entire civil government up to the level of provincial governor -- goodness knows, it confused me -- and gets a review at the national level in Beijing, where the decisions are sustained. This happens for ten years in a row, while judges, majors and even governors lose their jobs, because this crazy woman cannot be stopped.It's a fine satire of the effects of one determined person on a massive bureaucracy, as various people try to deal with her by varying means. While I found several stretches a bit slow, perhaps this is because in the details of general and particular points to make fun of, the particular points of Chinese government elude me. Even with that in mind, there are lots of good laughs, and some interesting playing around with mattes: the provincial scenes are shown through a circular matte, showing off the squarish architecture, and the Beijing scenes are shown through a small, rectangular matte, showing off the round archways. I think this is supposed to emphasize the difference way that local and national governments look at things. If so, it is a very nice conceit."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"Madame Bovary might feel slightly flummoxed why her name is in the English title of Chinese populism taste-maker Feng Xiaogang's 16th feature, literally, its Chinese original title means ""I am not Pan Jinlian"", Ms. Pan is a notorious woman in Song Dynasty, an adulteress in cahoots with her paramour murdered her husband by poison, whose enormity might even make Madame Bovary's countenance color, as far as occidental analogy goes, the transposition looks wobbly.Based on novelist Liu Zhenyun's 2012 novel, the film bracingly tackles China's contemporary realism by centering around a woman hailed from a rustic backwater, Li Xuelian (Fan), who is ignorant but particularly ornery. After the fake divorce scheme of her and her husband Qin Yuhe (Li Zonghan), to the ostensible purpose of acquiring a second property for the family (taking advantage of the loophole of current policies), unexpectedly backfires, Qin gets the property and on a moment's notice, remarries with another woman and leaves his ex-wife in the lurch. The hoodwinked and aggrieved Li takes on the legal recourse, to first, annul their fake divorce, then officially authenticate a real divorce from Qin, so that she can get the justice she thinks she deserves.Of course, Li's case is a nonstarter from the legal point, as they are legally divorced, and further exasperated by Qin's insult of her being not a virgin when they were married, Li takes her petition to scale up the entire bureaucratic hierarchy to no avail (shunned by officials and sent to re-education camps), until an off-screen plea with the communist party leader (Gao) during the annual NPC (National People's Congress) meeting in Beijing, which leads the latter to deliver an impassioned homily denouncing the bureaucratic malfeasance and the lack of trust between officials and the vast mass, and many have to walk the plank in the aftermath.After that, the narrative fast-forwards a decade later, during which, Li continues her crusade relentlessly, and on the eve of another NPC meeting, after consecutive visits from local officials, from the judge Wang Gongdao (Dong), county magistrate Zheng Zhong (Yu) to provincial governor Ma Wenbin (Zhang Jiayi), even she promises she will not petition this time, they refuse to take her at her word, provoked by a wanton demand of writing a guarantee, Li thinks better of it, and again embarks on a journey to Beijing with the help of her admirer Zhao Datou (Guo), which prompts the entire province to act in unison to prevent her reaching the destination, only in the end, after another significant deception from the stronger sex (she totally falls for the honey trap and reluctantly puts out, a borderline rape is a passing note), it only takes a morbid accident (or a man-made one to a cynical mind) to put the kibosh on Li's decade-long endeavor once and for all.Visually, Feng ups the ante with a unique frame system, most of the time, the film is fixed within a round frame (capturing the scenic composition with Feng's usual keen sense), only when the scene takes place in Beijing and its environs, the frame goes square, a masterstroke that differentiates the local sector's slippery evasion and the central government's rigid authority, only in the epilogue, years later, Li finally makes peace with her situation, the frame reaches wide screen, during a one-on-one with a former county officer She Weimin (Zhao Lixin), who is deposed in the wake of her action, she lets on the real season of her bloody-minded petition, but in this reviewer's ear, it sags the overall impact, to pat imputes hoisted-by-her-own-petard decision to the one-child policy is a disservice at that point, more achingly inconsistent is that Li has no one single scene with her unseen child through and through, Feng's last-ditch attempt to garnish sympathy to a character who has been as yet rigorously flouted our compassion is a sorry mistake.Mega-star Fan Bingbing painstakingly emulates Gong Li's deglamorizing tour-de-force in Zhang Yimou's THE STORY OF QIUJU (1992), a more sincere story about a simple-minded woman seeking justice against a patriarchal polity, physically exerted to a hilt and emotionally drained, she is nevertheless betrayed by wavering accent. However, sparks fly among the all-male supporting cast (even a cameo from veteran Fan Wei is spot-on for the ironic tone), among which, Zhang Jiayi is particularly eloquent as the senior governor who totally masks his stance on the issue with patient token mannerism which certainly rings a bell for Chinese audience.After all, I AM NOT MADAME BOVARY is not a Manichaean retake of a wronged individual versus a corrupt Establishment to a gratifying outcome, but a more judicious overview of a society afflicted by the chasm between ordinary folks and functionaries, a deficiency of empathy to those who are mistreated, only appeal for some reasoning to justify their misery, yet, to most public servants, they are threats of their well-paid positions, the canker is down to the bone, and we must hand it to Feng Xiaogang and co. for braving a hornet's nest with vigor, style and a hard-earned discretion."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"Cinematography is absolutely stunning in this, justly lengthy, portrayal of a woman's quest to gain justice for a wrong, multiplied several times, by uncaring bureaucracy. It is not until the end that we discover exactly why this woman is determined to revoke and repeat a divorce that everyone else insists is valid. She is cast as the indecent woman, a Madam Bovary, but she most definitely is not. She's not mad either, which is what you and all the other characters in the film are lead to believe. It takes patience to uncover the small piece of missing information that makes sense of all. Patience is richly rewarded in this thoughtful and closely observed film - almost to the extent of forensic examination through a microscope."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,This is a fun if somewhat lengthy satirical window (literally) into Chinese bureaucracy and one crazed woman's battle against it.Full of fun characters and quirky scenes. Fan Bingbing is superb and unrecognisable as the loony but determined hero.Worth the watch.
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"It is no secret that I enjoy Asian cinema tremendously, and when I got the chance to watch ""I Am Not Madame Bovary"", I naturally jumped at it. I had no idea what this movie was about, nor did I know who was starring in it.I managed to sit through 31 minutes into this ordeal before I just gave up out of sheer and utter boredom. The storyline never really kicked up into any gear that had any kind of appeal to it.And furthermore, the movie is presented in an unfathomably horrible round frame presentation. And it was a major nuisance to watch that on the screen. And it was definitely a big part of why I just gave up on the movie. Why director Xiaogang Feng opted for this round frame presentation is something that just eludes me.The acting in the movie was adequate from what I managed to witness throughout the 31 minutes I managed to sit through.I have no intention of returning to watch the rest of ""I Am Not Madame Bovary"" (aka ""Wo bu shi Pan Jin Lian"") solely because of the boredom that it instilled in me and because of the annoying round frame presentation."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"Every man is a good actor. But the director is not good enough, especially this kind of novel garbage picture. The story of the whole film is to develop in the direction of black satire, but because of commercial considerations, dare not say very thoroughly. Only Mayor Ma said something about the substance."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"That I mean, since it does not seem to be a professionally filmed film. There are Chinese movies that as if on acting, I think it's a way to shoot them, they interpret like that, but at least I get me out of the movie.Another thing that I do not understand and it baffles me and I do not know what he means by that, it's the circle and the square. I do not know why it puts them and if it is not understood then something fails. Only serves to lose part of the screen.I can not find the humor at any time, although it is true that I do not usually like the movies of black humor, sarcastic or otherwise.He has a good picture, but I just find that I do not like the director's work in any way, neither narrating nor composing, nor rhythm nor time."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"This film has so much potential. It's got good timing sequences, the cinematography is unique and the style is reminiscent of Wes Anderson.However, the details is just not quite there. Considering the director's bold move to choose such a small focus frame many aspects lack care.Raining scenes on the river shows clearly it's not raining in the distance. Many side characters clearly has no acting background with exaggerated body language and tone which was off putting. Some of the actors were not able to mimic the local accent consistently.Overall a very beautifully filmed movie with some great composition and interesting comedic elements. But if you have the knowledge of the language and quality of media in China, you might have also felt the lack of care because these are very basic cinema mistakes in TV dramas and B-grade movies."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"Possibly the most daring artistic attempt from Feng Xiaogang, the film tells the story of a peasant woman's petition from the countryside to Beijing because she felt that her divorce was unfair, and differentiate the local and central scenes with a round black and a square black frame respectively. The audience is separated from means of stage play, and the circle frame is wrapped by the square then, and they finally disappears. However, Zhang Yimou's classic ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" is in the forefront, and Liu Zhenyun's script and even Fan Bingbing's performance limit the result. The film matches Chinese mainstream and overly beautify the from-top-to-bottom bureaucratic culture."
我不是潘金莲,I Am Not Madame Bovary (2016),,2016,2016.11.18,"""I am not Pan Jilian"" in many ways reminds of 1960s Krushchew Thaw era films. The often critisized Soviet burocracy, but in an optimistic way, as in the end, good men win and bring change.One one hand, although only six years passed, it is hard to imagine such a film possible in a nowadays China, where actors are persecuted (including Fan Bingbing herself) and famous bloggers dissapear in the thin air.On the other hand, despite the seemingly critical outlook on CCP, in the end, the moral is that protest is vain and should be nipped in the bud, or 'sesame seed will become watermellon'. You see, the problem is not that oficials can persecute a person for years just for speaking out, the problem is that these oficials are ""inatentive to the needs of the common people"".Then, of course, there is this horrific rape scene after which Xuelian says that she 'never felt better'. Yikes.The films main strength is visual stoytelling. The varying frame shapes devide and show us two worlds. The round-shaped frames remind of the moon gates, common in traditional chinese gardens. Circular frames show us the somewhat backwards rural life. The square frames show us orderly world of the Party machine."
原来你还在这里,Never Gone (2016),,2016,2016.07.15,"""So Young"" supposed to be a movie about young love, but it ended up being a kind of movie that you'll watch and then forget it the very next day. The story is about a girl who was bullied in school, and the bad boy of her class, who helps her with her classes. When they graduate, he asks her to move to Beinjin with him, but she opts to attend a less famous university somewhere else. However, the guy can't forget it. Unfortunately, the only good thing that I could find about this movie was its length, as it was a one hour and thirty minutes movie (fortunately!!). And now, for the bad things: -the ending was terrible. I didn't get what happened and if they met or not. -the chemistry was not there. No passion, no connection, nothing. It was probably the only thing that might have saved this movie, but the couple was boring and with no chemistry. -the story was boring. The two lovers were from different worlds and it was obvious the ending of the relationship, though the movie could have surprised the audience, again, if the love story was strong enough. No twists, no interest and simply no fun. -the male lead's performance was terrible. Maybe it was the script that didn't help or that weird acts of affection that were kind of violent rather than loving, but still it wasn't good but blunt. Maybe I could go on, but I think that those are enough to support my 2 out of 10 rating."
原来你还在这里,Never Gone (2016),,2016,2016.07.15,"IMDb gave this film a 4.9 and I was a bit apprehensive about watching it. I still did though. My crush on Crystal Liu won out in the end and I have to watch this film if only because I really like her. Thank God I did. This is an awesome film. Let me explain why.(Note: Don't watch the MV if you haven't watched the film yet since this is the actual ending of the film that was deleted and eventually released due to popular demand. And no, the film wasn't bad because of the deleted scene. It's still good as is. It remains amazing still. - Also, spoiler sorta ahead.)First, the whole atmosphere, pacing, and imagery of the film reminds me of Koizora (恋空), albeit with less vendetta from the supporting characters. It shows how love unfolds between two strangers, classmates, friends. Yes, it's ordinary. No, love like theirs is not. At least, not in the real world.Then there's the cast giving life to the characters. Crystal nailed it. I've seen a bunch of her films and series and she always nails her roles. Su Yujin is as calm as the sea but we feel her every time. We feel her melancholy, her sorrow, her giddiness, her happiness, her disappointment with herself. Hell, I felt her conflicting emotions when he asked her if she loved him after all those years and she can't answer. It effing broke my heart. And this is coming from a person who hates (bold, italicized, underlined) female leads who are mute and meek AF especially when it comes to important scenes. I mean, what is so hard about telling the other party that you effing care? Of course there are valid reasons but they're reasons that barely matter mainly because the storytelling made it so; however, in Yujin's case, you know her reasons matter. She made you feel how much it matters.The lead guy, Kris Wu, is good as well. He reminds me a lot of Koizora's Hiro without the full on bad boy image. (Or there is, sorta. Heh.) He's good with his role as well. Lacking in some scenes. Overbearing in some but his whole attitude makes up for it. I know he was from EXO and I think his role is close to his image so it worked for him.The other actors such as the asshole friend of lead guy, lead girl's BFF, and sort of second lead guy were good with their roles as well. Particularly, BFF character. She's damn good. Sadly, we never saw her again after in about the last half of the film.The whole cast delivered to be honest. Minor things such as supposedly rival girl's stricken face after realizing how she's basically nothing to lead guy (finally!!! after freaking years; how slow is the character even?) which could use a little more work but it's okay because we didn't have to see her after that so all is well.And the ending.Let me state here how I am an open ending kind of person. I don't just like it, I dig it. It's probably because I'm a perpetually sad person but I like seeing characters end their stories at a crossroad of their lives. I like being left to wonder whether they find their happy endings (which doesn't exist unless the characters die happily; e.g. The Notebook, then fine it does 😜) or not. Whether they chose to live or die. Because that's how life really is. The story doesn't end even after the storyteller ends their storytelling. It goes on and on and on until life itself ends.Yet, somehow, for this particular story, I wanted to know if he at least found out that she did and does love him. I wanted to know if she was able to tell him. I wanted her to start catching up to him since that's what he's been doing since they first met. I want her to start being a person who takes chances as they come and not be a total risk-averse lead character. I have tons of ideas why I want her go out of that effing comfort zone and one of that is wanting a lead character, her specifically, to not be a person stuck in life like yours truly. I want her to not be me.Unfortunately, she, again, ran away and he was still the one running to catch her.That was my main problem with the film. On the other hand, as this was based on a book, maybe the director didn't really feel to be at liberty to change the characteristics of the characters so... ┐(￣ヮ￣)┌P.S. Eff you IMDb, this film deserves a 7.5 and that's that. 😊"
原来你还在这里,Never Gone (2016),,2016,2016.07.15,"If you watch this movie, or any movie. with the intent to critique it, you might be disappointed. But real movie watchers don't care about perfect acting and directing. We don't look for flaws in films. We want to be entertained and we want to feel emotions. This movie made me feel what they were feeling. It made me live what they were living. It made me remember those same feelings they expressed at that time in my life. My wife got me into watching these Chinese movies, and I'm so glad she did. I have discovered a world of cinema that I never knew existed, because we never saw these in America until Smart TV opened a streaming world to us. This film has the conflicts, the natural life disasters, the urges that drive our love lives. I'm a former U.S. Army combat engineer during the Gulf War and this film actually made me come to tears a couple times. If you don't feel the emotions in this film, it means you are repressing your emotions. Or it means you have never experienced that type of love and you can't relate to this love story, and that's sad. I must admit that I was disappointed by the open ending, until I saw online that the revised ending had been released in China and I saw that they did end up together. At first I was like, OH NO, not another House of Flying Daggers type ending. In America we see so much tragedy in our daily lives that we love, we need, movies that have happy endings. A romance like this has to have a happy ending or it breaks our hearts. This love story, even the extended friend story, begs for a sequel. I have waited since 11 years old to see all 9 Star Wars movies. I will live another 800 years waiting for this sequel. I have to see them reprise these roles and finish this story. Maybe after she finishes filming the Live Action Mulan reboot. We all want to see their wedding. Bottom line? Don't listen to critics. Watch this movie and enjoy it like I did."
原来你还在这里,Never Gone (2016),,2016,2016.07.15,"Umm, this is supposed to be a love story and romance, but it didn't turn out to be like that. As some critics said, it doesn't show love and romance. What they said was right. Although it does have some kind of love between two main characters, but it wasn't that strong. So, it didn't turn out to be love and romance drama.The reason why I watched this is that a friend posted this on his Facebook profile, so, I thought I would give it a try. While I was watching it, although it's some kind of drama, especially, it's a love and romance that kind of thing, but it didn't make me bored. That's why I gave four stars. Words are said like that, but it doesn't make this film a good film.There are some facts I don't like. Among them, what I don't like the most is that the female leading role is being deliberately pulled away from the male leading character who is also happened to be her boyfriend. I mean they could have gone with the flow. Even if they wanted to break the couple up, they could do it in a smooth way. But the way they chose to do it, it can clearly be seen it's done on purpose. So, I think it's one of the worst facts of this film.One more thing I'd like to mention is that the story isn't complete. It's like they cut in the middle. They should have continued. Cutting in the middle only makes the audience unsatisfied. So, if they continued, it'd be better.All in all, the film indeed is not that much boring. Even a girl who doesn't like love and romance films, could watch it, I guess you could too. So, I'm not saying it's one of the worst films and not worth spending time with, but it doesn't strong and it needs to be better than this. It's worth to give it a try."
原来你还在这里,Never Gone (2016),,2016,2016.07.15,"Just finished watching this and I have to say that it could have been way better. Our main characters first meet when he accidentally douses her with water and she is wary of him because he is rich. Long story short, they wind up having the type of high school romance anyone would consider forgettable in real life. This film tries to make us believe that theirs is a great love story worth fighting for, but it's not. Our hero is cold and looks stiff during those kissing scenes and our heroine really doesn't like him at all. He just doesn't get it. There was very little buildup to the romance. The added side plots don't really help the story. Both of them behave immaturely and the ambiguous ending was frustrating. I had to search for deleted scenes on YouTube that should have wrapped up the ending.Disappointing."

驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"This is a tragedy of a 1940's Chinese feminist. And much more than that.Since the English subtitles are trash, and lack of some key info. To help to understand this film better, here are some backgrounds you should know:The story happened in mountainous China in the 1940s. When Chinese suffered from the Japan's invasion in WWII, in this undeveloped little village far away from the war, a group of idealists who share a dream of ""educating every children in the rural China (like NCLB)"" of whom each has their own problems back in the city, founded a primary school. They soon find themselves face a series of ethical dilemmas and suffer the consequences of the choices they've made. Lies between their campus and the nearest water source is an over 10 kilometers treacherous mountain road. A black donkey named ""lv de shui"" is essential for them to get enough water for drinking and domestic usage. The title of this film, Lv De Shui, in Chinese means the water-fetching donkey, which is the name of the donkey.But the school's budget proposal for keeping the donkey is denied by the government. So they fabricate a fake person named ""Lv De Shui"", as their school's English teacher, and use that freeloading money to cover their cost on the donkey. And one day, an official from the Ministry of Education came to inspect Mr. Lv De Shui, their English teacher...OK, that's as far as i can go without giving you any spoilers.This film gives you a stage-play feeling in cinematography and editing. The acting is quite convincing and genuine. And hats off to the cinematographer, Mr. Jong Lin. The color use in the film is bold yet beautiful. And the theme song, I love it.This is an ambitious film in which the directors try to raise some questions, Like, does the ends justify the means? if yes, how far is too far? Where should we draw the line? If not, should we just stop and do nothing? Or are those who do nothing better than those who are willing to do anything? Or do we have the right to judge? Or in general, are we entitled to judge others life choices at all?Like, which is more awful? Set a very high moral standard and can't keep it or simply set a low one?Like, how easily people are to submit when facing violence or power.Like, how far your act of righteousness can go when the act itself will cost you financially and physically?Like, how hurtful it could be of labeling people.But for me personally, I think it's about being truthful and brave, be truthful to yourself and be brave to stand up for yourself.Watch it, you'll like it."
驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"The first half is a comedy and the second half is a tragedy. And to a certain extent, it ironically reflects the problems that China has been facing."
驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"As the film's slogan said, tell a joke, you can not cry. ""Mr.Donkey"" This film is rare in China, is not easy to release, when a movie, the more you do not want it to finish, it shows that this is a good movie. The ridicule between the absurd comedy color of the tragedy of the brewing, so that ""donkey water"" can be funny, But overall, this is a script tamp, intriguing black comedy. The film at the beginning of the era background in a remote village school, principals and three teachers conspired with a pull water donkey fictional teacher ""Lvde water"". To receive more than a salary to the Education Bureau, but how the EDB to the school inspectors, so a unidentified cobbler posing as Miss Lu absurd things to start, and to lie and continue to prepare the lie, The power of the film to promote the plot, but also for its tragic outcome foreshadowed.With the continuing ferment of this lie, this subversive attack on intellectuals and the corruption of education in a given environment, through the alliance of teachers and coppersmiths who are not strong, make the story more humorous and endowed with depth, In order to achieve the so- called dream unscrupulous divisions, and ultimately the film everyone from the good expectations were to be broken one by one, humanity is also completely lost before the bottom line of greed, the ugly most incisive show, to build the film is extremely good Of the inner depth."
驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"This movie tells a story about four teachers from the city each with some personality defects, came to a rural/desert place to run an elementary school. They started with selfless dreams to help educating the next generation in the rural area, but they have done something for their own interests and they have to cover up for it. This is definitely one of the better Chinese films. Who ever is reading this, You're considered lucky to even know this film, since numerous of great Chinese films are missed out outside of China. It's a tragedy that is facede'd with comedy that makes you think deep. The story reflects deeply on the worst parts of humanity, greed, lust, hate, corruption, social discrimination etc.Although it is a play-like, comedy-ish movie, the story feels very real and there are deep meanings behind a lot of the shots. It's overall very well written and fine directed. The directors are considered new to movie and the film is sometimes too much like a play, which is probably the main critic I have for it. Definitely worth your time watching."
驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"A surprisingly politically daring movie made by China's foremost comedic group, Kaixin Mahua. The characters, who are all caricatures of modern society individuals elevate the simple premise of making a donkey into a teacher so they could get more funding is anything but simple. The principle who wants to do the right whatever the cost, the freedom seeker who is taken advantage of, the loyal servant who bows to reality, the turncoat or even the simpleton are all trying to survive in a deceitful situation where they have no control over. Is the film funny? Not comparing to other Mahua Production films, but it is deeper in its meaning and less sappy. The film is a great parody of modern society China where lies just keeps getting bigger and bigger."
驴得水,Mr. Donkey (2016),,2016,2016.10.28,"The first thing to say is that this is a tragedy, first and foremost, with some comic elements.Because it seems to be described in many places as a comedy movie, which, along with the whimsical movie poster, might give you this impression that this is a going to be a feel-good experience. But no; while it has some funny jokes, they basically finish up by the middle of the movie and the rest is just a succession of appalling things being said and done. It's a morality tale; some relatively relateable characters start by telling white lies for the greater good but end up digging themselves into ever worsening problems.And herein lies the main issue I have: you can have a comedy movie where everything goes wrong: a black comedy.But if there's no humor and you're making an outright tragedy, then you need some other elements to sustain such a story. Here, it feels like they make a point by the end of the first act, and then that point just gets repeated, more and more painfully, through the second and third acts with little entertainment value.The 4 stars are because the acting is very good."
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"As for me, this movie is pretty satisfying as a comedy. There are a lot of high-grade jokes among this movie while jokes are very embarrassing in other comedies these days. Except for the humor, the flashbacks amused me very much and I believed this part had been edited surprisingly well. These flashbacks drew a clear and interesting outline of the character's previous life: abused by father, involved in love, betrayed by girlfriend, discouraged by father. Generally, this is a corny movie in which time-travel helps characters clear the misunderstanding of family or friends. However, this movie focus on the sense of humor and thinking of life instead of the science fiction part. In my opinion, the ending is the biggest flaw because there is no intact logical circle. It isn't based on any theory of time travel. The father knew the gesture because the son taught him. However, the son didn't really appear in the father's early life, and therefore, the gesture shouldn't be known. I know that Han Han wanted to write a mysterious ending, but I think it turns out to be the very flaw."
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"This was by far the biggest role for Chao Deng. My words just cant describe how unique this movie is, you cant put it in comedy, drama, action, romance. sci-fi as it has all of these beautifully integrated. I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, so here it goes: The main character, Lang, is a racing driver with a powerful ambition and a special father/son relationship. After THE winning race he takes his father for a ride and they both end back in time, and they embark in the greatest adventure you can imagine.The music has also a special role, and combined with the powerful emotions this movie transmits will surely make you cry silly at times.Only one more thing to say: Enjoy!"
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"I went to see this film on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend. He said he went to see Deng Chao, but I went there because of Han Han. The film is quite good, better than I had expected. The film depicts the China of 1990s,as Han Han understands it. Though a nostaglic mood is a little too early for a 35-year-old writer, the 1990s plays a very critical role in Han's growth and thus must impress him very much. In contrast to the cynicism and social criticism represented in his precessor,Wang Suo's works, Han's works permeat more with rebelism and energy. Han han comes from a small town near Shanghai, so the town presented in this film must be Han's replica of his hometown on a big screen. I hadn't expected Han would make a light comedy, but the production is very funny. But it seems to me the year 1998, which the hero travelled back to is not a good choice. The numerous social events presents in this film seems to be occurring around 1996, not 1998. In that decade, nearly each new year presented a different China, so the accurate selection of the year is very important. While watching the film, I kept thinking of Back To The Future, the American film that impressed many Chinese.I don't know whether Han had watched it, but the plot and style of two films are very similar. But the American film stands the si-ci out very much while the Chinses basically neglects it, only retaining the concept of time travel."
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"A thorough mediocrity is more scattered in form and spirit. The two main male characters are all poor actors. In addition, did the director have any misunderstanding about the town in 1998? Did you wear it back in the 1980s?"
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"I laughed and I cried, and that's what this film is all about. It's far from being original, and you can't even call it a sci-fi, but the script writer/director did a brilliant job in striking a balance between humor and other emotions. ***Wee bit of SPOILER here***The only thing that I thought could be better was the ending. I could easily accept the lack of explanation on how he was 'teleported' to the olden days and back, but I couldn't stand the lack of closure, especially about his mum. Personally I'm a big fan of happy ending, and the end wasn't exactly happy enough for me.It really should have been a 7, but I gave it an 8, because it really moved me. Not a lot of movies that can make me laugh and cry these days."
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"Overlooking Péng's poor age makeup and the disappointingly unexpected state of his and Deng's characters in the final before-credits scene, this was an enjoyable seven-star comic drama (dramady) about a man getting the opportunity to know his father when he was his age, but the poignant scene a minute after the credits start earns Duckweed an extra star. Han made a wise choice pulling this emotional scene from the middle of the movie and placing at the end, bookmarking this movie between two of its best highlights, which allows you to forgive the poorly conceived action scene in the final act. I would have preferred a different conclusion to this story, but overall this movie's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses."
乘风破浪,Duckweed (2017),,2017,2017.02.10,"This movie brought tears to my eyes,The protagonist traverses the youth who knows his father in the past, and truly understands his father. This is not just a family film, but also an educational film. To all the parents who worry about their children, but also to the brave young people chasing their dreams."
奇门遁甲,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV Series),,2019,2017.12.15,"Was enjoying Sabrina's rise into her powers, was enjoying Aunt Zelda become aware that she'd been turned into a Stepford wife-witch, was enjoying Lilith making a man from her rib... but then some work was required in the continuity department for the plot, and all of that enjoyment had to be thrown out of the window. Once again, could you please hire some writers who didn't graduate from the easy bake school of thought. There are some really good ideas being presented here, but instead of me being able to enjoy them, I'm constantly being dragged back to earth because of the inability, or maybe just the refusal, of the writers to actually work at the craft of writing and plot development, and it is dragging this show down!For example, they need evidence to prove that Ambrose is innocent so Sabrina and Nick find the body of his familiar that was being controlled by Father Blackwood (and made Ambrose to kill the Anti Pope). Sabrina brings it back to life so it can tell the council the truth and then just takes it home and puts it in a cage. No protection spells, no real security put in place at all, despite knowing that her cousin's life is depending upon the safety of this mouse. Just how stupid are we to believe this chick is? I personally wouldn't feel safe knowing that someone as dumb and careless as this character is has been loaded up with such an unbelievable level of powers.Writers, you're seriously trying to tell me that the only way you could come up with moving the plot along to the part where they free Aunt Zelda from Father Blackwood's spell, and Sabrina (almost) secretly calls up a faux visit by the dark lord to pardon Ambrose in front of the council, was by using the paltry ill-fated mouse shtick? Or that Harvey, after fighting his father for years over not following the family tradition (and winning), decides that today he just must go down into the mines so he and Theo can later find the shrine to Sabrina and make her believe herself to be evil after all?Please excuse me while I go find some beer I can cry into."

喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"At its core, 'This is Not What I Expected' is about two diametrically opposite individuals who start off butting heads with each other but end up falling in love. On one hand is Lu Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro), the CEO of a multibillion international company called VN Group who flies around the world evaluating hotels for their worthiness before deciding whether to acquire them or not. On the other is Gu Shengnan (Zhou Dongyu), a junior sous-chef at the boutique hotel Rosebud in Shanghai where Lu Jin and his subservient assistant Richard Meng (Sun Yizhou) has just checked into for business (not pleasure, mind you). It isn't just their statuses that are different; their personalities are just as dissimilar – Lu Jin is a tightly wound, clinical individual who prides himself at being a perfectionist; whereas Shengnan is by and large a free-wheeling lark whose blithe attitude to life is only disturbed by her recent breakup with the hotel's  (douche-bag) general manager Cheng Zixian (a very suave-looking Tony Yang). As much as scriptwriters Li Yuan and Xu Yimeng draw from the oldest trick in the rom-com playbook, their adaptation of renowned web novelist Lan Bai Se's 'A Long Time Coming' is no means stale. Oh no, the result is quite the contrary in fact. Mixing the familiar elements of an 'opposites attract' rom-com with the ingredients of a culinary comedy has proved quite the inspiration, and even if it does feel familiar on the whole, there's no denying that veteran editor Derek Hui's directorial debut still tastes fresh, delightful and often hilarious. Benefiting immensely from his years working with some of the best in the industry including Peter Chan himself, Teddy Chan and even Chen Kaige, Hui demonstrates confidence, discipline and clarity right from the get-go, displaying none of the shortcomings that usually plague first-time directors. That is clear right from the get-go: within the prologue, he establishes succintly not only Lu Jin's exacting standards in the food he eats, but also the businesslike approach with which he handles staff performance, telling an under-performing senior manager seated across a long table that he is fired. And then without letting up, Hui stages the first meet-cute between Lu Jin and Shengnan in a classic case of mistaken identity, as the former catches the latter vandalizing the hood of his car to avenge her heartbroken female buddy Xu Zhaodi (Meng Xi) and only agrees not to call the police after she lets him humiliate her, i.e. by writing on her forehead the telephone number of the company she is supposed to call to fix the damage she caused to his car. Oh yes, there is a precision to the way Hui approaches his scenes, such that each makes its point without outlasting its welcome. That same exactness also ensures the movie remains pacey – from the point Lu Jin steps into the Rosebud criticizing the customer service, room soundproofing and Michelin-starred food in turn; to his enchantment with the last-minute dish prepared by Shengnan and each one of her exquisitely plated dishes thereafter; to the series of encounters between Lu Jin and Shengnan that reinforce his annoyance towards her before he discovers she is the chef he has been enamored with; and last but not least to the pranks he plays on her before she realizes that he already knows her identity.There is plenty of screwball humour in between, and before the madcap antics turn repetitive, the second half switches gears for intimacy and even pathos. Over a nicely edited montage, we see Lu Jin turning up unannounced at Shengnan's messy but homely apartment where she lives with her dog named 'Boss', treating her as his personal chef, turning her place into his own home, and in the process discovering a much more human side to himself that he has been repressing. There is both sweetness and tenderness in a whimsical sequence where both hallucinate rain after having some poisonous blowfish for steamboat, and end up taking an umbrella out for a walk around the neighbourhood and on board a bus through Shanghai's beautifully lit streets. A late twist that sees Lin Chiling emerge as Lu Jin's personal chef is somewhat under-developed, but still makes the point of reinforcing how food has been a special bond between their hearts. And as a final note, it is admirable that Hui stays true to the quirks and eccentricities of his characters as well as their relationship during the heartfelt finale. That same consistency extends to Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhou Dongyu's performances, so that we not only believe that their characters are authentic but are also invested emotionally in them. True to its title, 'This is Not What I Expected' is an unexpectedly enjoyable rom-com – the jokes land mostly where they should, the romance is sweet but never cloying, and the presentation is brisk, lively and engaging. It also boasts a pair of leads with sharp comic timing and great chemistry that you'll miss hanging out with the minute it's over, and with the venerable Peter Ho-sun Chan and his regular partner Jojo Hui as producers, you can be assured of a finale that is touching, poignant and genuine. Just be sure not to go into it hungry, because the wonderfully delectable food porn shots within will make sure that it isn't just your heart that will be stirred."
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"Naming this rom-com This is Not What I Expected is a misnomer because everything that will happen is expected. This is 1 litre screwball comedy, 2 tablespoons of ""opposites attract"" and 3 slices of food porn. But make no mistake, even though the odd couple seemed mismatched, they will come together like the desert miss the rain.Lu Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) is the CEO of the VN Group and he is scoping Rosebud Hotel in Shanghai for a acquisition. A food connoisseur, he is not impressed by the dishes the kitchen sends up. Sous-chef Gu Shengnan (Zhou Dongyu) is then tasked to try her hand to impress the eccentric man, but unbeknownst to both of them, they actually had a run-in earlier. Lu is impressed with the dish and proceeds to stay and try more delicacies made by her. This rom-com is formulaic to a T but any movie buff will tell you that is not important. It is a foregone conclusion that the mismatched coupling will be a love-match made in heaven. The secret ingredient is to create hilarious situations to make them loathsome towards each other and yet give them redeeming qualities.Lu Jin believes that the world is divided into three categories – the pork eaters, the pork butchers and the pigs. He is eccentric, rude and condescending – the world is beneath him in every scene, but OMG Takeshi Kaneshiro is so good looking and so dashing in his impeccably tailored suits. This coming from a guy, you know he is handsome from every angle and my knees got a little weak just swooning at him. Kaneshiro brings just the right amount of detestable contempt but you will excuse him because he is about to be schooled in the art of food tasting and love.Gu Shengnan is his equal – opinionated and sure-footed. Excluding Lu's father, I think she is the only character in the whole movie (and probably all the cinema patrons) not sucked in by his good looks and powerful stature. There is a sequence where Lu challenges her to make a different egg dish which demonstrates how talented she is. Zhou Dongyu who won Best Actress at the recent Golden Horse for her excellent performance in Soul Mate is in scintillating form. She is a dork, but likable and feisty, like a delectable dish you can't have enough of. Her face feels like a sponge, soaking up everything life throws at her with the spunk of a child who knows no better.A lot of the success of a good rom-com depends on the chemistry between the stars and the sparks here feel genuine. There is some good character development on both sides for us to buy into their budding relationship, and enough treacherous detours to make us root for them. The food porn is just extra garnishing for a love dish that is already great.This is a great date movie but do go in with your tummy filled. It's time to check into Rosebud Hotel and do make a special request for room 1123. Oh my my knees are becoming weak again."
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"A Chinese chick flick smartly welds a cookie-cutter template of meet-cute with blatant gastronomical seduction and eye-pleasing cityscape which one might infer it might be clandestinely sponsored by Shanghai travel bureau. The glob-trotting CEO Lu Jin (Kaneshiro), arrives in Shanghai to assess the buy-out of a boutique hotel nestling in the city center, a choosy gourmet, he is overtaken by the dishes prepared by a young chef of the hotel, Gu Shengnan (Zhou Dongyu), with whom he develops a mutual attraction through the food-ordering-and-preparing contest and consecutively a preposterous co-habitation (sans physical contact though) in the latter's center-located oldish apartment, until a hiccup temporarily severs their growing romance, before a climatic confession routinely rigged up to bring them together. Yes, a synopsis can be applied to most commodities in its often derogated genre. Lu Jin is not a nice person, obnoxious, disengaged, an insufferable obsessive-compulsive germaphobe, but since he is played by a spiffy Takeshi Kaneshiro, all can be forgiven (his repugnant personality has his upbringing to answer for), not to mention his $350 billion net worth, and all thing considered, he is just a lonesome, friendless man who is fostered to have no emotion connection with anyone because of his wealth and status, which will come undone thanks to a slightly loopy girl, who has only 5-year experience in the culinary business but inexplicably can tame his über-demanding stomach.It goes without saying that the film's success is predominantly hinged on the performance from the two leads and their chemistry, and the outcome is moderately propitious. Having an 18-year age gap to paper over, a 43-year-old Takeshi Kaneshiro manages to hold court with his impeccable youthful mien, and brings both exigency and absurdity to the fore if he strives to without winking at the facile script. For Zhou Dongyu, who was discovered by Zhang Yimou in UNDER THE HAWTHORN TREE (2010), has now magnificently matured into a young, bankable leading actress of her generation, she is the heroine who precludes the film from sinking into an abysmal vanity project through her vaguely cutesy but visceral outpourings when the movie needs them the most. No room is left for its sidelined peripheral roles though, Chiling Lin is vouchsafed with a glamorized cameo and a much cherished reunion with Takeshi since her screen debut in John Woo's RED CLIFF diptych (2008, 2009). First-time Hong Kong directer Derek Hui does input a few ingenious brainwaves into the cliché-ridden plot, a trippy folie-à-deux occasioned by consuming poisonous pufferfish has serves both as visual novelty and romantic nectar; choosing a local food market when the crunch arrives hews to the tenet of prioritizing Shanghai's vernacular loci over modernized anonymity; and the setting-sun watching finale is an opportune legerdemain to this unapologetically old-fashioned, overly chaste, roundly castle-in-the-air fluff, and this is exactly what I expected!"
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"Kind of like a food porn that is carried by its two charming leads. A very pleasant and silly film that makes you smile throughout its running time. Takeshi Kaneshiro and Dongyu Zhou own the film, Kaneshiro with his sharp looks and the lovable stubborn nature and Zhou with her cuteness and innocent quirks. While the luscious variety of food items makes your mouth water, the humour goes along with it to give a good time watching this beautiful albeit silly film."

Hithertofor, I always thought ""Chinese comedy"" to be an oxymoron - I've seen a few - or tried to watch them, but they were never even close to funny. This is warm, funny, colorful, creative and a lot of fun. I'm writing this review someone will give it a try and enjoy it even 1/2 as much as I did.This movie is both an homage to, and a satire of the great ""food movies"". It is in the style of the screwball comedy genre. Its not perfect, but it is really a lot of fun, and way above average. They lead actress is fabulous - on par with any great comedic actress I can think of. She just sizzles in every scene. I would love to see her in more movies. All of the cast was good, but she was really extraordinary. The movie has humor and heart."

There is a lot of nicely executed pratfalls between the two and embarrassing situations that never really seem overdone. With good pacing, nice dialogue, there are cute laughs and an exotic description and appreciation of culinary preparation. While there isn't anything deep, this is a fun, sweet and light romantic comedy to just sit and enjoy the rising sun."
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"The cuisines in this movie were so colorful and so eye-appealing. Takeshi Kaneshiro, as Lu Jin, was a good cast but too many close-ups focused on his face that inevitably showed he was already a 46 years old actor, maybe a little bit over to play this role, unless this director was heavily influenced by Hollywood's 1940s to 1960s old movies, full of middle aged, even over 50s older actors to play all the leading Alpha roles in romcom movies, such as Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Randolph Scott...those who dominated the big screen, played the big lovers to those young female actors like Audrey Hepburn....these old guys were all too old to play such roles, because to those young actresses, they looked more like fathers or even grands. So the director requested the casting agency to find a middle aged guy similar to Gary Grant to play this Lu Jin role, and likewise, signed up Dongyu Zhou to play Gu Shengnan, with an under-developed body, no figures at all, flat all over skinny and short young woman, exactly like Audrey Hepburn.I have to say Takeshi Kaneshiro and Dongyu Zhou most of the time performed well enough, but the comic screenplay and the scenarios sometimes forced them to overact, broad acting too much. But Zhou's face and skinny body made her look too young and too small, exactly like the leek vegi. Then Kaneshiro, on the contrary, seemed to be too old to play Lu Jin, an already over 45 son who was still harshly controlled by his father.I have to point out some of the actors in this romcom were terrible and no talent at all even this movie was a farcical comedy:Chiling Lin, as Lu Jin's Personal Chef; terrible! Absolutely NO ACTING TALENTat all! Ming Xi, as Xu Zhaodi; terrible actor with very limited acting talent. Xiaosong Gao, as Gao Fushuai; what a joke. Tony Yo-ning Yang, as Cheng Ziqian; absolutely no acting talent at all. Yi-zhou Sun, as Meng Xinjie; limited acting talent.So obviously, this romcom was just an okay movie; a comedy with lot of yelling, screaming, cursing and broad acting."

It's a cute rom-com and while it definitely doesn't really break new barriers or tell a new story but it does deliver and enjoyable easy to follow movie. Zhou Dongyu is so cute as hell in this role and her bubbliness ties the entire movie together.
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"I watched it again, I still like it very much, it is really well made. Food, color, and the character's character are also closely related to these two instincts, blending to tell stories. The food knowledge is very interesting. The so-called Hollywood sentence ""watching a movie, learning a knowledge"", even more rare is that the food participates in the plot, assisting the plot and characters. The type of Chinese chick movie, this one will definitely be in the forefront."
喜欢你,This Is Not What I Expected (2017),,2017,2017.05.05,"I hate food content in general, but this movie's cinematics was beautiful and really consumed your attention. It was very well done. I feel the actors were just right and both leads really held up and created a wonderful dynamic. There is an age gap between them but it isn't in any way part of the story or used in an inappropriate manner. I disagree with wanting a younger male lead, I think no one would convey so well with facial expressions as he did. It is one of those movies you just sit back and enjoyed the ride. Realistic enough to not bother you but it ain't about being realistic. It is about making you happy. Must say it worked. Even though this ain't my typical taste in genres."

Internationally, it is called the second Sino Japanese War and the Japanese War of aggression against China.The Anti Japanese war lasted 14 years from September 18, 1931 to August 15, 1945. In 1931, after the Japanese invasion of China launched the September 18th Incident,.they completely occupied the northeast of China and established the puppet Manchukuo state. After that.they successively created troubles and provoked wars in North China, Shanghai and other places.The national government adopted a compromise policy to avoid the expansion of the conflict.On July 7, 1937, the Japanese Army started the Lugouqiao Incident near Beiping, and the Sino Japanese war broke out in an all-round way.After Japan launched the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, Chongqing national government formally declared war on Japan on December 9.

非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"This action film but not be for everyone because by many other action standards it could be considered slow. But my movie group liked it - they take time with the characters - they explore their backstories, there are quite a few characters to follow but hang in there. Because there are some set action pieces that are gangbusters. In fact whoever did the main motorcycle stunts and car crashes deserves high praise. Some real stunning stunts - especially when the guy rides his motorcycle from one building to another! Plot wise you've seen it all before - cop goes deep undercover as he tries to bring down vicious drug cartel, but it's handled well and the acting is pretty good. So we recommend EXTRAORDINARY MISSION for the action & stunts!!"
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"Most viewers in the US will think of little more than the Kung Fu Theater films of the past when they think about action films from China. While those films were entertaining they can't begin to compare to the product coming out of China now. Led by director John Woo in the eighties the country has followed his lead by making some of the best action films out there. Consider EXTRAORDINARY MISSION among them.Lin Kai (Xuan Huang) is an undercover officer with a past providing him a reason for wanting to take on the drug lords. His mother killed herself using the heroin they ship in large quantities now. Lin infiltrates the gang at a slow and steady pace, first ingratiating himself with the local dealer. But he's working his way up the ladder for the top man.Each step of the way finds Lin in more danger than a secure position. When his immediate boss is killed before his eyes and he is targeted next only his skills allow him to survive and reverse the position. But rather than kill those sent to kill him he instead pledges his allegiance and discusses wanting to take over the old boss' territory.Moving up in the ranks Lin is eventually brought before the man at the top known as The Eagle (Duan Yihong). It is a journey spent mostly with a bag over his head that transports him from his home location into Thailand and beyond. The Eagle's home base is a city that he runs, complete with a school to take care of children as the factory he's built refines and packages drugs. But being his city it also allows his private army to control the town and his safety.As greed prevails The Eagle tries to direct the council he heads into taking on the methamphetamine trade. Thinking they already have a lock on heroin and not wanting to step on the toes of the South American cartels they decline. When the most vocal of them is shot and killed, their tone changes.With information in hand, Lin passes it on to his handler, Li Jianguo (Zu Feng). An incorruptible officer determined to take down the drug lords Li is stunned to learn that the man in charge is The Eagle. Li has a history with The Eagle, an association with his past where he thought the man was dead. When Lin passes the name on to him he recognizes there is more at stake than just drug trafficking.The last 30-40 minutes of the movie finds Li required to go to the city owned by the Eagle to confront him for past sins. The end result is a fast paced and frenetic exhibition of stunts, pyrotechnics, gunplay, hand to hand combat and more that fill that full 30-40 minute period. It is one of the longest onscreen battles that I can recall seeing put on film. Best of all it works, moving along at such breakneck speed that you don't consider the logistics or unending supply of ammunition to the guns on hand, instead getting caught up in what's transpiring.The movie is one of the best action films I've seen in some time. It provides enough story to draw you in but before those moments take up too much screen time someone is shooting, being shot of fighting to propel the story forward. It was a fun movie to watch and one that I know I'll revisit.Director Alan Mak directed the film INFERNAL AFFAIRS which was highly praised. I missed seeing that one but it's now on my personal radar and one I'll be seeking. I can only hope that he follows in the footsteps of Woo and makes his way here to the US to work with English speaking actors and brining his sense of style and action to films here.Not only does the film provide story and action it looks amazing. The grainy films of those old kung fu flicks is nowhere to be seen here. Instead the crisp, clean images are amazing to behold. You feel as if you've been placed in the jungles here, feeling the sweat drip down your spine from the humidity. That the images can convey that speaks volumes.Too often US movie fans will bypass foreign films, many like this with no English dialogue and subtitles only. That's sad because if they'd bother to take the chance and watch movies like this they'd be delighted with the end results. So set aside those prejudices about language and make a point of seeking this movie out. If you love action flicks you'll be stunned and have the time of your life. And it might make you decide to expose yourself to"
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"After a promising start, some fine action sequences and beautiful scenery, the film slows down significantly around the halfway mark. It then drags the viewer through a series of events that I just did not find compelling enough. It only livens up towards the end again to bring us a great climatic chase scene with shooting and explosions galore. Like most drug trafficking films it did not capture my attention for the duration of the movie. I must admit, though, this one did have more depth and emotion than most films of the genre, and featured beautiful music, as well. I enjoyed the fact that all the characters managed to find closure for their inner demons."
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"Other than those chasing and gun fights, what we got here is a stupidly written screenplay and very bad and wrong casting job. So you just give some fake identity cards to a entry level cop, then this guy could so easily become an undercover druggie who could so easily infiltrate the drug cartel and rapidly raises himself as one the key persons in the cartel? What a joke! Then this guy could so easily arrange meetings with his handler and submit the cartel's activities, manufacturing factories, routes and whatsoever. The crappy screenplay simply making everything look so easily and readily arranged. And then we got the serious problem of casting. The leading actor who plays the undercover guy did a poor convincing job, his only thing to act like a lowlife is just keeping chain smoking. The car chase, the escape....whatever, every scene just look so conveniently and easily self-explained but simply highly unlikely and impossible, yet every impossible scene and scenario just worked out easily. This film just borrowed a lot of thrilling action scenes to cover up all its impossible and improbable scenarios. The screenplay simply sucks big time, it gives you lot of busy scenes on the screen but never paid any attention to the logic and reasoning. It's more like a video game instead of a convincing movie."
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"Another user here called this flick 'heroic bloodshed'. I find that qualification a bit misleading. I'm of the opinion (not shared by everyone) that 'heroic bloodshed' should be reserved for a particular wave of Hong Kong action flicks of the late eighties and early nineties. For my taste, EXTRAORDINARY MISSION is too far removed from the meticulously choreographed, highly stylized gun violence that was so typical of those flicks. (The same user review that equates this flick with heroic bloodshed also mentions Bay as a reference point, which is more on the nose, I think.) If we have to stick with Eastern action flicks for references I would call this a cross between INFERNAL AFFAIRS (written by the same guy) and last year's OPERATION MEKONG. Sadly, this flick borrows the convoluted plot from the first flick and the overall ridiculousness (and not to mention nationalistic attitude) from the second.I have nothing against ridiculous action flicks, far from it, but EXTRAORDINARY MISSION tries to be a serious undercover cop drama while serving up nothing but clichés. It fails to be believable. Neither was MEKONG, but what that flick at least delivered was a barrage of hard violence and insane action sequences (with the shoot out in a mall half way through as the real high light). To see anything similar in EXTRAORDINARY MISSION you will have to wait until the last 20 minutes or so. The action is spectacular, but for me, it wasn't worth plowing through ninety minutes of unconvincing, uninteresting undercover blues.If you're an action fan and haven't already seen OPERATION MEKONG I suggest you put this flick aside and watch that one instead."
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"Needless to say that I sat down to watch this movie because of my admiration and love for the Asian cinema. And with this obviously being an action movie, then what is there not to like?The storyline in ""Extraordinary Mission"" (aka ""Fei fan ren wu"") was a really messy and fuddled one. It was a storyline that made very little sense in most aspects. And it didn't help that the characters were equally confusing, and not really having any distinctive personalities. This mundane character gallery was definitely weighing down the movie in overall.The movie was sort of sluggish throughout two-thirds of the movie, right up until the location changed to Thailand. Then the movie amped up its action sequences tremendously.And while we are on the topic of the action sequences in the movie, then I must admit that they were quite good, and it ultimately was those that held the movie afloat.""Extraordinary Mission"" might have an impressive title, but the movie itself was actually only mediocre."
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,"Extraordinary Mission centers on an Undercover cop who attempts to bring down a major crime syndicate operating within the Golden Triangle(basically a narcotics ring between China and Thailand), as he is tested again and again due to the gang's suspicions of him being a cop, he becomes a drug addict himself and has to battle the addiction while also staying true to the badge. To say this is all the film is about would be criminal, no pun intended, as the narrative is filled with a lot of great arcs for nearly all of its characters that are interestingly and logically connected to one another, you feel like there's a reason why characters are the way they are, and the script by Felix Chong allows for some witty dialogue, and clever twists and turns that make sense and never come off forced. The story has a lot in common with Infernal Affairs, having basically the same plot but a grander scale as that masterpiece, but so are most Chinese/Hong Kong action crime dramas. There's plenty of effective drama here too, the lead actor Huan Xuang who plays Lin Kai, does a superb job portraying a police officer, slowly losing his grip on his sanity, as he navigates a dark and treacherous path of drug trafficking, but you can see him also trying desperately to hold on to his better side and remember the side he's on, it's this mixture of internal and external conflict that is not nearly as explored in films of this premise that adds a greater layer to an otherwise redundant plot that is also skillfully executed here. The supporting cast lends the film a lot of background and credibility too, from Kai's captain who first assigned the mission to this poor fella, to Eagle, the leader of the crime syndicate. The bonds formed between the characters are engaging and quite full of depth, as you discover that the Captain and Kai are more alike than their professions suggest and that there's an even greater connection between the three of them and another late-introduced character that really gives the plot and the relationships a great boost of both emotional and narrative resonance, rest assured, the Chong delivers a fascinating little examination of the classic Heroic Bloodshed plot line.Now the other trait of the Heroic Bloodshed genre, is the extremely ballistic gunfights, meticulously choreographed fight sequences, car chases and beautiful cinematography, that as so popularized by HK legends: John Woo, Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark back in the day. Here Director Alan Mak and his favorite Director of Photography Anthony Pun, deliver a blistering action picture, with numerous set-pieces involving all of the above-mentioned goodies. From daring escapes featuring cool tricks with hiding under police cars, to some really unique ways pistols are gripped, twisted and shot, to the more obvious gunfights where concrete, vegetable carts, cars and literally everything in the environment is destroyed as easily and gorgeously as a child scoring his first Pinata strike. There's this really muscular and coherent way that the film's editor combined the long-takes and shots by Anthony Pun, that is a cross between sleek, wide and kinetic takes of the classic HK action era, to the more tightly-knit combinations of angles and frames, that gives the film a sense of urgency and speed rarely seen nowadays in Militaristic action films. Extraordinary Mission also has one of THE BEST motorcycle chase sequences and possibly one of the coolest ""Hanging on top of a moving car"" scenes in film, I also really enjoyed the theme rock song that perfectly describes through its lyrics what Kai is going through and here his mind and heart lie, the soundtrack by Kwong Wing Chan and Taq Sakakibara is energetic and fitting, especially during the last 20 minutes where all hell breaks loose. Fortunately though all that hell breaks loose for a reason, a good reason at that too, as the filmmakers ensure that the only way the characters are resolving their grudges held against one-another for over 10 years, is a massive Michael Bay-esque ever-escalating shootout that delivers what fans of the genre expect.Extraordinary Mission is a return to form for Alan Mak and Felix Chong after a somewhat lackluster Overheard Trilogy and The Silent War, delivering a fast-paced, intriguing and character-rich action thriller that acts both as a tribute to the police's efforts to combat drugs and criminals, and just as an overall entertaining blockbuster with exemplary finale."
非凡任务,Extraordinary Mission (2017),,2017,2017.04.07,This movie is full of action with a decent plot but director went a little overboard with poor editing and it is long by 30 minutes.

At one point an action sequence went on so long I got up and made a coffee only to come back and find it still going.The characters are 'almost' Bond like in their over the top-ness.Parts of it did feel like an 80's Jackie Chan film.It is worth watching I guess but I can't really express why :)"

This movie was produced in China and has similarities to a Jackie Chan movie, except that it is slightly better. It has a silly, comedic timing mixed with some serious, violent scenes. The audience was filled. I only speak English, but it had subtitles. They spoke rather fast, so I could not keep up with their words, but the scenes told the story. Basically, two detectives are on a hunt for gold and a murderer. There is everything in this movie: a beauty queen, a tiny amount of sexiness, mobster actors, a straight man comedic partnership, racing scenes, dancing, excellent marital arts fights and beautiful scenes."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I thought the movie was very, very funny.It had some very good jokes in it. You get nervous seeing comedies in a different language than your own and wonder if you'll get the jokes, but the jokes were a simplistic base of comedy that everyone can laugh atPlus several of the jokes were visual slap stick that was just universal. In fact the movie all together was visually simulating, which showed Thailand's Chinatown to be a very colorful place.The two main actors in this were an exceptional team as well. The movie is about a young man who fails out of the police academy despite his exceptional skills in observation (he plays the straight man). TY get over his depression he visits an uncle who lives in Thailand (he plays the screw ball) Together they have to solve a murder while looking for a gangster's gold. It was a really fun, entertaining film to watch."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"This is not just a funny comedy, but also a well-made film with great quality. The actions,funny scenes,dialogues were orchestrated in such a great way that it drew every second of my attention.Wang Baoqiang did a great job in playing a character that is both silly and witty, wild and cowardly, someone you want to slap in the face but also give a dollar out of pity. I usually justify things in a quantitative way. And here is the math:The average driving speed of the vehicles in the movie is about 20% of the avg. driving speed in 007 Spectre; but the car chase scenes are five times more intense with the cars looking way faster that those in 007 Spectre.My opinion might be biased since I was able to ""fully"" understand the movie with my full Chinese proficiency, and I also thought Spectre was the worst 007 movie which totally wasted two hours of my life. Anyway, I thought this movie was a job well done."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I must say Chinatown Detective is never the best detective film, but it's a good one. Funny, plot reasonably complicated, a twist in the end. Two young actors' performance is convincing enough, especially the girl. Her last scene really struck me and many other Chinese audiences. I doubt if those who didn't see any good out of it watched it throughout at all. It doesn't have the fanciest or epoch- breaking technical innovation, but neither do most filmmakers around the world. For instance, the gunfight in the hospital is a good scene. The escape from the police station might be a tribute to Jackie Chan's earlier films. There are many funny moments where I got good laughs. But not understanding the Chinese language will cause a problem to that. A few of the actors are renowned for their comedian work in their local dialect. The robber wearing glasses are famous for his comedies in his Northeastern dialect which is a big contrast to the location of the film. If a viewer doesn't understand Chinese or Thai, they might not know that the Thai police chief would give instructions in Thai but threaten to fire the two Chinese officers in Chinese.The humour isn't that Chinese people are making fun of Chinese people. It's that the safest joke you can ever make is about yourself. After all, character arrangements are only film characters. They're not always meant to be realistic, especially in the comedic bits. It's strange if anyone imagine all Chinese people will be so ridiculous as certain characters. There's also deep philosophy hidden in the film which I wonder how many Hollywood popular films have. If you don't watch Chinatown Detective carefully, you probably have entirely forgotten about the caption at the beginning of the film. In fact, the ending of the film or two young characters in the film is the evidence to the caption at the beginning. It is also in the discussion between the two youngsters. Therefore, whoever says this film is a complete failure or anyone who watches this is an idiot will be an idiot in my eyes, honestly. Reviewers like BasicLogic might lack basic logic in certain ways. If I don't like some film, I won't say this film is made of utter stupidity, because it's non-sense. Only seeing the problems in Chinese film industry instead of problems in their own film industry (I guarantee there must be some as there's no such thing as a perfect industry) is just biased and arrogant.Whoever says this film isn't funny at all, it's because people have different perception on humour. I never found Annie Hall funny. I thought The Hangover franchise or Due Date weren't so funny for my taste. But I enjoyed The Philadelphia Story and Divorzio all'Italiana. I don't think it's the best idea to judge negatively upon a comedy which is not your taste. (Not to mention you don't understand the Chinese language, which means you won't get any linguistic humour.) On the other hand, an art-house film or documentary lover shouldn't look down upon a good comedy simply because it was made to be entertaining. Ultimately, most films are made for entertainment. If you want to be high-brow, that's your own business. But don't laugh at others who want to have a good laugh.I would personally recommend this film. If there are people who hate it, that's not their fault. But that's not the film's fault either."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I'm not a huge fan of the films put out by mainland China, finding them flawed in various ways: either bogged down in appalling CGI, spoilt by unwanted propaganda, or packed with the lamest comedy imaginable. I thought the same would be true of DETECTIVE CHINATOWN, but it turns out to be a lot more enjoyable than I had hoped. The story follows a young, bland cop, played by a slightly wooden Liu Haoran, who is reejcted by the police and who heads off with his bizarre uncle to solve a murder case in Thailand. Said uncle is played by Wang Baoqiang, who I previously saw in the likes of BLIND SHAFT and KUNG FU KILLER, and he turns out to be perfectly cast. He's eccentric, over the top, very energetic, and most of all, funny. His character is pretty outrageous but he makes the film enjoyable and his long-running feud with a rival leads to the movie's greatest moments. Some of it is slow and sappy, but the lowbrow slapstick scenes are fun and there's some Jackie Chan-style action and a scene or two borrowed from THE RAID 2 which are very entertaining."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I have seen lot of Chinese movies, mostly garbage in terms of story line and quality of production. However this movie was quite well made movie. I'm impressed. Some people may don't like this movie because it is not right taste, but I think this movie was enjoyable and truly entertained. I recommend for who like comedy, action, thriller movie. I do not recommend if you like dark and serious movie."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"As a detective movie, the mystery is decent, but squashed into the last quarter of the film. The first half of the movie is ""silly fun"". It is funny, but mostly physical comedy and ""wu li tou"". After a lot of chaos, finally they start to analyze and detect. In the last 1/4, the film also manages to squeeze in a twist and surprise.Without giving out spoilers, one of scenes has a facial expression reminding me of Edward Norton's brilliant portrait of Roy in Primal Fear.Overall enjoyable but nothing unforgettable."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"In summary, a smart kid visits his uncle in Thailand after failing to become a Detective in China (for reasons). Soon after arriving, the uncle is incriminated.. and the both work towards solving the case. The uncle knows the town (and is quite agile) and the kid is more than smart. Frenzy ensues.It reminded me of old Chinese movies, similar to Jackie Chan's older work.. but there is more thought put into the script than the action.** A note : Even if it is a Chinese production, this is a movie filmed completely in Thailand! Now, most of the cast speaks in Mandarin(?), several lines are delivered in Thai(?). So! Even though it seemed to be a properly translated movie (subtitles), I still felt some minor details were a bit confusing.. Didn't really affect my understanding of the main plot.Anyway.. as for the movie itself : This is a chaotic and comedic mystery with more energy and colorful real-life-locations filled with extras than I was expecting. It has a darker tone underneath (as you would expect from a murder mystery), but it's hard to take it seriously. It is primarily gags, but doesn't mean that people that like to play along with the resolution of a case won't enjoy it. In fact, there is a lot of cleverness hidden amongst the jokes and unrealistic chasing all over ""Chinatown"". If anything, I enjoyed unraveling it as it went along. Sadly, it's more interesting than it is fun, but scarcely so. The action isn't particularly memorable, but the varied and a well defined cast makes up for it.As of now, I can't see how the third movie in the series made so much money.. as this seems to be a one-and-done kind of thing. But we'll get there.Entertaining enough to watch, but at 2 hours and 15 minutes it is a bit long."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"Mixing Crime, Comedy is never easy. You could succeed with awards or flop into winning in Rotten Tomatoes.I am fortunate as I speak English, Chinese and Thai so it was easy to follow the plot and this is truly a winner.Everyone having a bad day at work should watch this and be entertained.. which is after all what comedy means. Enjoy.As for the comedy, the slapstick escapades sequence is just great tribute to Charlie Chaplin. If any reviewers take offense to the farce, they must have not watch Mr Chaplin epic slapstick routines.I really enjoy the sequences of another lead getting his nose busted in every scene he appear... a tribute and parody to another Hollywood detective that has his nose plastered from start to finish...The crime is a lock room mystery with a twist. And as one of the main role idolize Sherlock Holmes, the tribute to the cinematography in the Hollywood version with Downey is not lost and thoroughly enjoyable.And then there are the actions... the actions are surprising. I agreed. Watch the car chase scene and the fight scenes... no spoilers here..And finally the black comedy portion. The Hospital shoot out and the reference to the sound track at that moment is truly a genius. R&D on the meaning of the song and you will enjoy the shootout scene!! I see a lot of tribute to Thai black comedy style which I enjoy. And I hope this will encourage viewer to look into more Thai black comedies if you enjoy this movie. A lot of gems there.To top it off...the film squeeze in a hidden moral message. See the other reviews for a clue.As lost in translation goes, I am afraid its true... easily some of the conversation true meaning might be lost if you watch the subtitles.Fortunately ""using a deity as a hostage"" meaning is not lost in subtitles.If you are a film buff, you will be truly occupied spotting the parodies and tribute and amaze at how all these can be spliced in effortlessly.And when do big budget movie see an ending sequence where you know the entire cast have a roaring good time? The ending itself put you in a humming mode and remind you to laugh and be entertain.If you watch this film to spot continuity errors, and be critical on every scene and plot.. you should not be watching this film.Do watch if you think you want to be entertained."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"Naturally I sat down to watch ""Detective Chinatown"" (aka ""Tang ren jie tan an"") when I was given the chance to do so here in 2019. I wasn't even familiar with these movies prior to stumbling upon them randomly. And given my fascination with Asian cinema, of course I had to watch it.I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But it just never really caught on with me, and I must say that it was a drag to sit through this ordeal of a movie. Actually, I didn't even finish it, as I fell asleep twice throughout the course of it and simply just gave up with 40 minutes left of the movie. At that point I was well beyond my threshold of what I will endure in a movie. And ""Detective Chinatown"" was not delivering anything particularly entertaining for me.The storyline here was just unappealing, and it wasn't something that I found amusing. Sure, there were a few smirks and smiles here and there, but that was about it what director and writer Sicheng Chen managed to acquire from me as I watched this movie.I didn't really care much about neither storyline nor characters in the movie. There was just something fundamental missing from everything here to make it an interesting movie. For me, it seemed like writer and director Sicheng Chen was just running everything on auto-pilot.I am rating it four out of ten stars, solely because of the production value and the fact that they had some fair enough actors and actresses in the movie. However, this is not a movie that I will be returning to finish, it just simply wasn't within my liking. And now I have heavy doubts about sitting down to watch the sequels."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"After failing his police academy entrance exam, Qin Feng (Haoran Liu) visits his uncle (or cousin) Tang Ren (Baoqiang Wan) in Bangkok. When Tang Ren finds himself the chief suspect in a murder case, Qin Feng uses his powers of observation and deductive skills to solve the crime and clear his uncle's (or cousin's) name.I've long been a fan of Far Eastern cinema, but have often struggled with Asian comedies. When I clapped eyes on Baoqiang Wang in Detective Chinatown, with his inane grin and stupid hair, I thought 'here we go again', positive that I was in for 2 hours of excruciatingly unfunny nonsense, and the first half an hour did little to change my mind, especially with Wang's silly voice adding to the irritation.But then something unexpected happened: I laughed. And then soon after, I laughed again. Then, to my surprise, I found myself caught up in the murder mystery plot, and admiring Sicheng Chen's assured direction (especially the visual manner in which Qin Feng mentally processes clues, which reminded me of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes). Wang's daft character grew less and less irksome, to the point that I actually looked forward to his next wacky exploit. Detective Chinatown had finally won me over.A colourful mix of comedy, adventure, and intrigue, the film ultimately delivers thrills, spills and, yes, even laughs, and although it is half an hour too long at 136 minutes, the reasonably fast pace ensures that it is an entertaining ride, right up to the final twist and the fun song and dance number during the end credits.6/10 - it takes a while to warm to, but is worth the effort."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I didn't particularly like this movie. Now, to be fair, this type of film isn't exactly my favorite. There were even some redeeming qualities to it.For example, I appreciated the script. The dialogue was quick-witted, quirky, and fun to follow along with. I also really enjoyed the general plot, as it was familiar. I appreciated this movie as a nostalgic reminder of the crime movies I used to watch with my grandmother as a child. As with similar movies, I grew to adore the lovable protagonists and even root for their success.On the other hand, several aspects of the movie were tedious and a little disappointing. While I enjoyed some of the quick and smart dialogue, some of the English subtitles simply flashed on the screen too quickly for me to fully absorb. This left me with a somewhat fuzzy understanding of some of the more nitpicky aspects of the movie. Also, the movie seemed to drag on a little longer than necessary. I found myself hoping the movie would come to an end sooner rather than later.Overall, I did enjoy the movie, just not enough to watch it again!"
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"It's a 2015 film but I watched it in 2020 btw.The film is great. I love everything in there, the songs, the quality, the story plot are totally well-made. I think I laugh in most of the scene, it's really entertaining to watch.What I don't like about this movie is I think the story was to long and too many scene in one film (I'll watch Detective Chinatown 2 soon) and it makes the film a little bit boring to be watched. There's also some scene that is unnecessary.But overall its fine. You won't be disappointed in watching this film. It's a happy ending I guess? Idk.I recommend watch this film when you have 2 hour free time."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,A jobless young boy went to america for met his Uncle for some job..but his uncle got into a problem in murder and he try to save his uncle..Nice story screenplay and comedy and finally good twist in climax..Must watch movie..!!
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"Little fresh meat can't keep up with Wang Baoqiang's rhythm. It's simply a feeling of narration. Qualified playful movies, the finishing touch is the last girl's amazing laugh."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"...i think this movie is OK for teenagers and people with low i.q. for once i agree with reviewer ""basiclogic"". this reviewer just kills all Chinese movies just-about. but....yah...this movie was that bad, i tried to stick it out but had to turn it off after 20 minutes. i was hoping it would be a really good comedy..but in the first 20 minutes i didn't get 1 laugh out of it. the movie is also stereotyping Chinese people but its a Chinese movie...thats low. this movie tries to be a gag a minute but after 20 minutes it wasn't working for me. its good for people who are racist against the Chinese. for all the good movies coming out of China you're going to get some bad ones too. its a shame really..Chinese making fun of Chinese..would be OK if it was funny, but it's not. watch at own risk...be warned."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I just dont know why some places nominated this lousy movie. Is it influenced by bribery which is well known in China. This movie tried to be comedy but only average, nothing big deal. The story is average and the stunts are lousy. The only big in this movie is they employed more medium stars and many low grades extras actors. But however overall is still an average quality movie among China movies. Not recommended to watch because there are too much better movies and dramas than wasting precious time even if you have too much time."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"Its definitely a fun movie, tons of comedic moments and glad that it didnt stuck in a one tone formula like other chinese movies. Leaning towards adventurous, mystery and actions, which reminds me of sherlock holmes and detective conan. Very enthusiastic casts and great use of landscapes and other cultures. The storyline was kinda basic and very predictable moments. Had a lgbt representation but not sure on how it was executed since china government arent lgbtq+ friendly. So yes, recommended."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"It's enough that all the actors of a movie are online, the plot is reasonable and coherent, and the director's shooting techniques are becoming more and more mature, bringing laughter and stories to the audience."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"Logic, the combination of suspense and comedy have no sense of harmony, the laugh point is reasonable and interesting, in line with the plot direction, even some seemingly a little deliberately laugh point actually turned out to be foible. The structure and integrity of the story, as well as the sense of rhythm, are well controlled. As the story crescendo, one link after another, a lot of doubts seem to be complicated and confusing, but layer upon layer, people can not understand."
唐人街探案2,Detective Chinatown (2015),,2015,2018.02.16,"I heard that the third film in the series was massive in china at launch so i fancied getting a taste of what another country loved.After seeing the second i can say that the first film spends a lot of time building the character relationships, but by the end they feel like old friends.It's a serious murder mystery that happens to be being investigated by a genius and a clown, i loved it.It has dark moments, shocks, silly chases, laugh outloud moments and a gunfight in a hospital corridor that's a whole new level of ""what the hell am i watching?!"" But i loved it.See this, then you'll love the second even more."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"How Long Will I Love U is a romantic comedy movie with supernatural elements and a few gloomy sequences. It tells the story of a real estate shark who plans on traveling nineteen years into the future to use this knowledge in order to expand his empire. However, the shift in the space-time continuum fails and opens a portal nineteen years in the past instead. It turns out that this portal is in the small apartment where the loan shark lived when he didn't have any investors and was about to lose his job. In present-day, a young woman who works in a jewelry store and dreams of getting married to a rich man lives in the same flat. One morning, she wakes up and is shocked to realize she shares her apartment with the unsuccessful property designer. In the beginning, she is distant to him and wants to get rid of him but their curiosity makes them bond as friendship soon becomes love interest. The young woman realizes she can't alter the past and the young man can't alter the future and attempting to meet their former or futures selves would lead to chaos. The young woman still travels back to the past to see herself as a child playing with her rich father who would soon die in a traffic accident. The property designer is curious about his future and stunned to see he has become a rich real estate shark. In present-day, the pitiless real estate shark realizes the past is about to shift and tries to convince the young woman to leave his former self and offers her the life she has always dreamed of. However, the young woman realizes the emotionless real estate shark is nothing like the sympathetic property designer but she has to make a choice that could alter past, present and future.Let's start with the few negative elements about this good movie. First of all, the background story about time travelling is poorly explained as the script is lacking details in this part. The introduction of the young woman is somewhat confusing as one isn't quite sure what her real job is as she is mostly about to scam older men into marrying her in the beginning. Some parts of the movie are unnecessarily overacted, especially by lead actress Tong Liya who offers too many fake smiles and tears.On the other side, the story is quite original and every loose end is solved and every question answered in the end. The movie's romantic side isn't too exaggerated and has a clumsy, juvenile, and sympathetic note. The film offers lots of situation comedy, especially when the property designer discovers the future and is amazed by food delivery services, mobile phones and virtual reality. The movie also has a gloomy touch related to corruption, greed and murder which obviously involves the mysterious death of the young woman's father. The film also has the message that money doesn't make you happy and shows how people in China are obsessed with fame, influence and money and leaving their communist culture behind for a world of steel, plastic and glass.In the end, How Long Will I Love U is an entertaining movie that mixes romantic, humorous and dark elements in a balanced and unique way. Younger audiences in a relationship might even find this film even better than just good. If you can catch the film at a local cinema, don't hesitate to go for it."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"Not only the nearly perfect performances of the two main characters in this film attrated me, but also the very ""spirit beauty"" of actress Tong truly fascinated me! Support them and try to watch ASAP!!!"
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"I don't speak or read Chinese, only fluent English, it was great movie and I had to read subtitles. Maybe one reason is its refreshing to see a movie not made by US Hollywood and roles you wouldn't see an Asian character have but its made by a country that doesn't have that issue :^)Really though very touching and moving at times, dramatic, charming, romantic comedy, as good if not better than anything US Hollywood makes in this genre. Chinese movies are getting pretty good these days and only getting better, hope to be able to see more movies and not the same ole that is US Hollywood."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"I have to start off by saying that writer and director Lun Su was definitely on to something good and interesting here with this 2018 movie titled ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"" (aka ""How Long Will I Love U"").When I sat down to watch ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"", it was without ever having heard about the movie. I happened to stumble upon it by sheer luck, and my fascination with Asian cinema prompted me to pick it up and give it a go without ever having heard about it.And I was in for quite an interesting and enjoyable story from writer and director Lun Su. Well, right up to the point in the storyline where the future timeline Lu Ming character entered the storyline. Then everything just crumbled and the storyline lost all forward momentum. I have to say that the movie totally fell apart here, and I lost all interest in the events that transpired on the screen from that point. A shame, really, because ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"" had so much potential.The acting performances in ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"" were good. I wasn't familiar with the cast here, but they definitely put on good performances in bringing the characters to life on the screen.If you enjoy Asian cinema, then perhaps give ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"" a chance, should you have the opportunity. Just because the storyline died on me, doesn't mean it will do so for you. And trust me, there is definitely something good to the storyline and script.Ultimately, I have to settle my rating of ""Chao Shi Kong Tong Ju"" on a four out of ten stars, based on the fact that the movie just simple fell apart and turned to rubbish."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"First of all, the actual English title should be ""How long will I love you"", other than the weird pingying stuff ...A really heart touching love story on top of a brilliant time-travel setting, even the ""scientific"" part is not rigorous enough (but at least make sense) ... Apart from that, the story telling is neat, and the performance of the leading actor and actress are impressive. They did very well on picturing the struggling of the two grass root youth from two different generations, and how the chemistry grows between them. And the whole movie is quite entertaining (it's a comedy anyway), and I really enjoyed the part they ordered the shabushabu takeway, very funny.I really wish they can make more films like this one in the future!"
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"Clearly, the writer-director Su Lun knows nothing about filmmaking, and just contrives this coincidental nobody-knows-what chaos. You can hardly distinguish the real and the fantastical, or tell whether fantasy changes reality. The viewers are completely wrung out by the end of the movie. The storytelling is just horrible, if there is a story."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"How Long Will I Love U is a solid foreign film, with some laughs and an alluring Liya Tong.The personality of the successful and future version of Lu Ming's very different, so does it matter that it's him. She wants to be with the unsuccessful version, but continues seeing the successful one, questionable. When they meet at the end, is she the same though, as her life would of changed drastically."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"The two leading actors were fine, but the whole movie was just terrible, especially the horrible childish soundtrack that further ridiculed the lame screenplay. Most of the actors in this movie also got a serious problem: I think they all needed retraining to learn how to speak clearly, when they spoke fast, all the dialog out of their mouths were unclear.I think the Chinese, especially the people who live in China, still don't know what are the differences between the 26 English alphabets and the English words. You can't combine those those English alphabets to translate Chinese word by word to pronounce the Chinese original title ""Chao shi kong tong ju"" into completely meaningless English. ""Chao"" is not an English word, nor ""shi"", ""kong"", ""tong"" and ""ju"", they are just totally meaningless pronunciations invented by the stupid Chinese who didn't know putting English alphabets together to pronounce Chinese words meant nothing, the original Chinese title is more than enough to allow their own people understand the meaning of the movie title, but if you want other countries' people to understand what the meaning of this movie title, you must find, translate and put together the movie title in Chinese into a certain meaningful foreign languages. If you just so illiterately put English alphabets to directly match the exact or somehow closer pronunciations word by word, nobody in the non-Mandarin speaking countries will understand WTF they mean, even lot of the Chinese themselves may not understand those words in English alphabets. ""PingYing"" is not English, ""Chao shi kong tong ju"" is NOT ENGLISH, if you want to translate these Chinese words into meaningful English, you have to find English words which could somewhat match the meanings of these Chinese words, so ""Chao"" would be, might be, may be ""Surpass, Bypass, Transcend, Cross over..."", ""shi"" means ""Time"", ""kong"" means ""Space"", ""tong"" means ""Together"", ""ju"" means ""Reside, Stay, Live...""; these are the English words instead of English pronunciations; so if you translate this Chinese original title into English in a broader literary meaningful English ""How Long will I love U"" or just rigid word by word translation in English, such as ""Surpass the Time and Space to Live Together"" is at least understandable to non-Mandarin speaking people; to them, ""Chao shi kong tong ju"" doesn't mean anything.As to this movie itself, I could clearly track how many movies in such genre had been copycatted, pilfered, mixed together, patched together by its screenplay writers, adapted and transformed them in Chinese version."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"The film is really good, in the genre of romantic fantasy and about time travelers. This film doesn't really show a very romantic side. The essence of the story is that these two are met in the same place but at different times, after going through the twists of love & life they finally unite, and finally happy. My advice, if you watch it, just relax but still concentrate on the film, if you don't, you will get dizzy."
超时空同居,How Long Will I Love U (2018),,2018,2018.05.25,"I really enjoyed the movie and the actors in it, and it was great how they integrated two different eras in time and how the house looked from two different time zones."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"A Cool Fish is an action-comedy movie with a dramatic twist. It tells several different stories that are all linked. We follow two friends and thugs who want to rob a bank but end up taking cell phone models from a cheap store and hide in the apartment of a suicidal woman in a wheelchair. The brother of said woman is a security guard and former police officer who now works for a businessman who betrayed his own clients and the security guard tries to retrieve a gun that was stolen from him. His former colleagues don't care about the gun however and are busy chasing the two thieves. The security officer's daughter is friends with the businessman's son who tries to clear his father's name. His father's clients and partners organize daily funerals in the city to put pressure on the businessman who has fled the city with his emotive girlfriend. All these characters will end up at the same spot for an explosive showdown.Does the plot sound confusing to you? It actually is and that is one of the few flaws of the film. It includes too many characters, locations and side stories. Some elements of the plot are also quite hard to believe. Another flaw is the dragging ending that certainly overstays its welcome. This film would be much more efficient if it were fifteen minutes shorter.Apart of the stretched ending, A Cool Fish is a dynamic, entertaining and funny movie. The action scenes have hilarious slapstick elements. The dialogues often have dark and dry humour. The actresses and actors are rather convincing with the suicidal woman in the wheelchair being the greatest of them all.If you are looking for an entertaining action-comedy movie with a few profound touches towards the end, you will certainly enjoy this dynamic film. It's not a particularly memorable movie but an enthusiastic one that is best enjoyed at your local cinema with a few friends. It's certainly more creative, vivid and surprising than another Hollywood reboot of an old action-comedy franchise."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"I chose this movie to see only because I want to find some fun to kill time in a bored afternoon. At first, I really did laugh a lot. Then I couldn't help crying for many times while watching the rest of the movie. Every characters were funny. But I could not laugh at them. Instead, I felt deep sympathy about them. In Chinese, ""wu ming zhi bei"" means a person lives in the bottom of the society. Such a person isn't worthy a penny for his name. In this movie, the security guard, the two thieves, and the lady on the wheelchair, they were all small persons. But they still fought and struggled against the destiny.In addition, the episode song sang by the guitar player was very very fair-sounding. I chose this song as my cellphone's bell for a long time."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"Well, sure I hadn't even heard about the 2018 movie titled ""A Cool Fish"" (aka ""Wu ming zhi bei"") prior to sitting down in 2021 to watch it. But with it being a Chinese movie that I hadn't already seen, I needed no persuasion to sit down to watch it.And while ""A Cool Fish"" was watchable, it was by no means an outstanding movie. For me, the storyline was just too much of a scrambled and random mess, so I don't really grasp what writers Zhilong Lei and Xiaozhi Rao were trying to accomplish with the different storylines that they tried to tie together for a unified movie. It just felt out of sync with each other.I will say, though, that the acting in the movie was good, despite of the storyline being such a scrambled mess. But the acting performances were definitely good throughout the course of the story, and I was in particularly impressed with actress Suxi Ren and her performance, especially since she virtually had no body language to use in her acting, given her role in the movie.While I managed to sit through the entire course of the movie, I must admit that I was starting to drift off once or twice along the way. For me the movie was just not really delivering a wholehearted and coherent storyline. So I am not giving any praise to director Xiaozhi Rao for this 2018 movie.My rating of ""A Cool Fish"" lands on a four out of ten stars. If you enjoy Chinese cinema, this is hardly a noteworthy movie, nor is it one that I will recommend that you rush out to watch. ""A Cool Fish"" was good enough for a single viewing, albeit not an overly impressive viewing, but it is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"Another rare dark comedy, this A Cool Fish has a really fantastic cast. In particular, the performances of Binlong Pan and Yu Zhang are just stunning and memorable. However, the screenplay and editing falls short compared to those of Crazy Stone. There are too many coincidences and the plot lacks credibility. The editing is also somehow artificial and contrived."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"""A Cool Fish"" is the tale of two would-be criminals and an ex-cop trying to prove themselves in order to change their unfortunate lots in life with no idea how interconnected the lives of everyone they know have become. With the exception of a single dumb gag near the beginning, the rest of the movie treats the audience respectfully using believable and relatable characters who find themselves in both touching and humorous situations, ultimately leading to a refreshingly unpredictable ending. A bonus ""what happened next"" during the credits gives a sense of conclusion for anyone who prefer stories which end a bit more definitively."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"The script is better, but there are good movies made in China. Garrich's multi-line narrative is still useful in comedy, especially in domestic comedy. As long as the plot is reasonable and the conflict points are delicate, the plot can be relieved. This film should be classified as the plot, the farce to female incontinence is basically over, the latter is more about the pursuit of the lower class of society and its realization of the hardship. Movies can be used to give a happy ending, but in reality life is not so simple. So, the drama is awkward, do not want to make a scene in the end but did not go deep."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"Two wanna be hoods rob a mobile phone store, end up trapped in an apartment with a very strong headed woman. in the mean time a wanna be cop tries to find the person who stole a gun he found. there's a lot more of course. the film is rapid fire. it's also funny. with drama. and pretty good."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"Beneath the surface of absurd comedy, film is the bitter core. The little people who are struggling at the bottom of society are crushed by fate, their hopes and dignity broken, their inner desires crumpled and discarded at will. In this gray world, the heart's desire is insignificant. Unknown men who live in the depths of the ocean struggle to swim to the light of the sea."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"I will tell u a joke ,please do not cry.(sorry,ur review is too short)"
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"In the lazy afternoon, I watched the film with tears and laughter. Especially at the end of the film, when the brilliant fireworks set off the black and white confession, the tears are hard to control.I was moved by ordinary people or people struggling on the edge of ruin. Several people with different fates had been misunderstood, ridiculed and banished in order to prove themselves in reality. But they were pulled together by ""love"" and aroused their desire and courage to live. It is worth seeing ..."
无名之辈,A Cool Fish (2018),,2018,2018.11.16,"The actors and actresses performed really well in this movie, the leading lady part showed us how to act without body language."

黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"Golden Job is a fast-paced Hong Kong action movie reminding of the genre's golden era between the late eighties and mid-nineties. The film is similar to other contemporary genre flicks like The Adventurers and Europe Raiders. The movie convinces with a steady pace from start to finish. The action sequences are fluid and spectacular. The car chases towards the movie's climax and the infiltration of the fortress during the falling action and resolution are particularly memorable. The settings are also interesting as the film takes places in an African refugee camp, in the beautiful city of Budapest, in a traditional Japanese village, in the flashy city of Fukuoka and on the stunning coast of Montenegro.On the negative side, the plot is predictable and almost shallow as one has seen similar movies on numerous occasions. A group of five orphans are adopted by a caring father and become mercenaries for a good cause. One of them gets corrupted by greed and turns against them. The remaining four brothers try to save him but things soon get too far. The fact that an intense action movie tries to be moralizing and attempts to teach lessons about family values is somehow misplaced and even cheesy. The film also features uninteresting side stories such as the eldest orphan and his love interest from a refugee camp or the adoptive father and his immersive experience in a Japanese village. The special effects look somewhat artificial at times, contrasting the almost philosphical content oddly.If you like Hong Kong action cinema, you can't go wrong with the intense Golden Job. If you expect anything creative, profound or unique being added to the traditional genre, you will end up being disappointed. Golden Job is a good average genre movie that will grab your attention for one hour and a half but quickly be forgotten soon after. At the end of the day, I would only recommend this movie to genre fans."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"So overall the movie is good,, it has a nice plot , maybe i got a bit confused at first , because i was trying to know exactly which language they speak , Mandarin or Cantonese then they spoke Japanese somewhere mixed with English here and there so i think it confused me a bit but nonetheless the Action and explosions were extreme but good ,, the script was okay digestible and somewhat easily followable .. the CGI and visual effects were spot on for once ,,The cast did good engaged well ,,, and at the end when things got emotional the did well too.as i said at the beginning it might get a bit too extreme for you with all the overdosed action and explosions but the story is worth it.. Recommended."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"A peculiar brotherhood of thieves,doing heists in hungary,japan,and montenegro,so there are lots of different spice to boost an action thriller.the filming and sound are great,acting impeccible,the editing and directing are smart and the special effects are good.some of the car driving scenes are spectacular.. there are 0.001% romance in this flick,the rest is pure speedthough i felt the blood spatter meter went over the top,i can recommend this film,its good."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"The 2018 Hong Kong movie ""Golden Job"" (aka ""Huang jin xiong di"") from director Kar Lok Chin is definitely a trip down to the glorious 1990s, where the Hong Kong cinema was flooded with an abundance of action movies that were not so heavy on the script and storyline but crammed with an orgy of action, shooting and car chases.""Golden Job"" stars a handful of well-established and famous actors in the Hong Kong cinema. So it was definitely a nice treat to sit down and watch the movie, for a long-time fan of the Hong Kong cinema such as myself. The cast list includes the likes of Ekin Cheng, Jordan Chan, Kar Lok Chin, Michael Tse and of course Eric Tsang.The storyline in ""Golden Job"" was entertaining for what it was, but don't expect this to be an intricate plot of twists and surprises. It was pretty straightforward, but also predictable and simplistic. But it worked out well in the charm of the feel of the golden age of Hong Kong action cinema.The action sequences were nicely choreographed and executed, and they did carry the movie a long way. But needless to say that the collective acting efforts of the established cast also did its share to bring enjoyment to the movie.All in all, ""Golden Job"" is an entertaining and enjoyable action movie, definitely watchable for what it was. I am rating the movie six out of ten stars. However, this is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing, because the storyline doesn't really have that much contents to offer - let's just be honest about that.If you are a fan of the Hong Kong cinema, then you should take the time to sit down and watch ""Golden Job"". However, if you are new to the Hong Kong cinema, then there are far better movies to sit down and watch."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"Golden Job from director, action choreographer and stunt man Chin Kar Lok is somewhat a homage to the HK action flicks of the golden years while at the same time suffering from a basic storyline, silly script and typical Chinese film CG - that could have worked so much better in real life!That said - flaws and all - I was quite entertained with it all. It was great seeing the now mature cast of Young And Dangerous back together again alongside director and star Chin, with the wonderful Eric Tsang and surprise supporting roles from the great Yasuaki Kurata and Billy Chow...While the story itself was typical of a late 80s/early 90s HK flick, it did lend itself to some fantastic set pieces with nicely choreographed action and gunplay - particularly the last action scene which I found to be great fun!While far from perfect - with one big let down for me being the lack of martial arts fighting Kurata had, and the same for Billy Chow. I hadn't seen him in anything recent for many years and most of his action scenes were done as gunplay...I did like Golden Job. Although I caught it on my plane journey to Hong Kong, I'd be quite happy to watch it again on a bigger screen and hopefully appreciate it a bit more.Hopeful next time, director Chin Kar Lol will lay off the CG and guns and give us some good old 80s style HK martial arts we all really miss!"
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"I gather Golden Job is some sort of sequel to an earlier series of Hong Kong action pictures. It's glossy, well-produced and like the very similar The Adventurers, was mainly filmed in a variety of European locations. It's like an oriental blend of Ocean's 11, with the more recent remake of The Italian Job, with a lot less plot and far more, (predictable) seen before, highly choreographed action scenes.The acting from the very much male dominated cast is strictly cardboard, run of the mill. The women folk are very much shuffled to the sidelines to get out of the way of the boys having fun and creating much chaos with their big, fancy toys. I think there are only 2 tiny roles. One is of a rather silly girl, who later becomes your regulation damsel in distress and the other is a do-gooder of a doctor working in an African village.The narrative tries to be multi-layered but is clearly faking it and simply exists to allow us to move between action scenes. All I can further add, is that I really hope the calibre of Golden Job isn't indicative of the quality of the earlier films. I think I'd prefer a dose of John Woo's 80's and 90's material any day to this derivative, generic product."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,I tried watching this tongue in cheek action movie but it was so silly that I gave up.Give it a miss.
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"Same old retread of a band of ""get-to-gether-ever-so-often"" crooks w/usual theft of gold bars from truck. Lots of moronic seen before shoot outs, then car chases, then more shoot outs, then more car chases - all formula looks like every other of dozens of movies with the same hooks. Usual double crossing member; usual organized crime characters. What makes it stand out amongst the aforementioned is the disorganized script & poor acting."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"When it comes to action scenes (shootouts, car chases) this more than delivers. On the drama part it will depend on how you perceive certain things. Melodrama and family drama and friendship drama ... things get muddled a little to, as is the tone of the movie. Again it will depend on your view and sensibility on certain issues.So while I would say it lacks or is very much flawed on certain aspects, the movie is more than entertaining (with a small dose of social criticism thrown in there for good measure). If that is something that might float your boat and you generally are a fan of these types of action movies, you won't need convincing anyway. Just don't expect this to be another copy of a Hollywood Blockbuster."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"These Hong Kong actors are like Hollywood's Rat Pack, a group likes to stay together not just on the screen but also off it. These guys are the mid older generation actors, but none of them is actually talented enough to be called ""great actor"". Now, they are becoming older, even past their prime, but together, they have the powerful influence in Hong Kong's movie business.By the over-the-top settings covering Europe and Japan, lot of exotic cars smashing, crashing lot of buildings, interrupting the traffic wherever they shot those car chasing and gun fighting scenes, the production budget obviously was so big, but sadly, it was developed on a weak, loose, and ridiculous messy screenplay, scenarios and plots, extremely cliche'd. Typical Hong Kong style but like these actors, it's not a good enough, matured enough movie, so formulaic and one-way predictable, no matter how much they spent on the special effects, CGI graphic and stunt coordination.The worst part in this movie is their Cantonese dialog, a quite ugly dialect that simply lack the seriousness what a suspenseful action thriller should be even with the good English or Chinese subtitles."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"Pipeline routine works, the whole film rhythm is a little too fast, the plot is thin, the characters face makeup. In fact, depending on these old faces, slowly ponder the plot, and break it into three pieces, maybe it can be seen."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,Not a satisfying movie. The story line was rushed it was all over the place.. Action was good.
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,Nice movie after 20 years reunion of Young and dangerous love it.
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"Bad movies can always be spotted if you can figure out what the pitch given to studio execs was. 'Golden Job' was pitched as 'Ocean's Eleven' meets a great big barrel of Chinese crap.'Golden Job' has lots of familiar faces. Unfortunately, none of those faces seem to spend any time in acting class. The only thing worse than the player's is the writing.What is the point of even making moves like this? Some one please tell me!"
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,"A great action movie performed by Chinese actors Asian movie is at a high level. Only artificial cars explosions are offended, you can see it with the naked eye. Shooting and fighting look more truly. I highly recommend it! Worth watching."
黄金兄弟,Golden Job (2018),,2018,2018.09.28,I don't like this movie. Not good story and script.
南极之恋,Till The End Of The World (2018),,2018,2018.02.02,"Some mistakes were made in making this moving, but it is the story, the talented actors that holds you until the end. The landscape is stunning; beautiful cinematography. The tale is so emotional, so incredibly sad that I kept crying, and I never do that. I gave it 10 stars because of the amount of emotion these two actors were able to pour into the film and bring out in the audience (me). Well done and well worth watching."
南极之恋,Till The End Of The World (2018),,2018,2018.02.02,Till the end if World invites you into the chambers of Antartica where love and nature is only hope for hold. Hodl! To the whale in the clouds. It is a true classic Where you find true bless your tears.
南极之恋,Till The End Of The World (2018),,2018,2018.02.02,"Amazing! I love Mark Chao's movies. He is picky with his projects and they are all worth watching. He puts his heart to every role he plays. In this movie, his transformation from a materialistic, enterprising nouveau riche to a gritty, caring survivor is tantalizing to watch. The cinematography is awesome, giving the audience a glimpse not only of the breathtaking view of Antarctic wilderness but also its ferocity and terrifying feeling of isolation. The love story is a heartwarming bonus."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"First I just want to get this out of the way. This is the BEST representation of Jeter. Bravo to the director who DJ trusted and for great reason.Not many people know the real Jeter i.e best sense of humor and always made his teammates laugh. Also too many people misconstrue Jeter as being overrated. The latter makes absolutely no sense and isn't logical.Finally this brilliant docu series shows how fundamentally important Jeter was in playing a role as a Captain. He led by example. Non Yanks fans know he hit over 3,000 hits but aren't aware that he could have had many many more hits but he ALWAYS ALWAYS put the team first that's why he always bunted to get the player over rather then go for the hit. He sacrificed a lot and put a lot on the line.He's not the best player. However he is one of the best players that demonstrates what it is to be a leader and be the anchor to their championships. Mo, Posada, Bernie, and Andy would be the first to admit that.When he retired I felt so detached from the Yankees without the players i grew up watching had all moved on and especially Jeter. His career is a storybook ending. Whether hitting his 3k hit as a homerun,, his final game at the stadium and his final game. He left it all on the field. You can't gage Jeter by his career numbers but by the context in which he played.As for this incredible series, I'm so glad Jeter revealed a side of his personality while showing his sense of humor. Awesome behind the scenes details that I've never knew about as a Yanks fan.The first two episodes are significant because it shows that you need to face adversity to shape and mold your character. It should be a lesson and inspiration to other aspiring athletes. If you want it enough NEVER GIVE UP ON YOURSELF. Just believe in yourselves.This is a doozy 10 out of 10.Bravo DJ and the whole production team involved that helped create such a masterpiece and I'm 100% confident that it will only get better."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,Love the content and background info this gives us on Jeter. Really cool to learn more about a player that already has books written about him. Excited to see where it progresses from here.
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"The life of Derek Jeter, former shortstop for the New York Yankees and member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.Superb documentary on an extremely talented baseball player. Takes you through his life and baseball career, from younger years to Minor Leagues to the Majors and success with the Yankees. Also covers his post-playing career and his personal life.Not just a linear event-by-event account of his career, but through interviews with himself, his family, former teammates, opposition players and staff, baseball reporters and baseball experts we get to see what made him so great, not just on the field but off it, e.g. Handling the media, PR in general, avoiding the trappings of fame.Very interesting and illuminating and a blueprint for other aspiring sportspeople."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,Amazing documentary that covers everything you knew and didn't know about Jeter. It is so well made and captivating. Growing up a Yankee fan this struck home. I remember sitting on my couch as a kid watching Derek win 3 World Series in a row and this brought back all my childhood memories. Phenomenal.
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"Derek Jeter's parents did something many baseball fans cannot. They spoke to their child through a filter that suggests he was their equal and they did this with the wherewithal to understand timing, tone and language, as all parents should. The heroism here is not the thing that made Yankee fans pump their fists. It's in Derek's good fortune to be born to respectful love, where Dad isn't in competition with his gifted son but becomes a part of the flow, the unique river that is Derek Jeter- so poised, especially in NYC, and so intuitive in his confidence to wait to have kids so he could love them and his wife in ways a constantly traveling person cannot. The influential story here is in how his parents loved him and were able to hear him, help him and guide him with only calm and intelligence and peaceful decisions, day in, day out. They taught him how to be the amazing father and husband he is. No small feat - people are ""striking out"" at this all day today, tomorrow - they don't teach this in school - there'd be no time in the schedule for ""American history"" haNow it's your turn. Really lay into me.Happy Friday from a true baseball fan."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"There's only enough interesting content about Derek Jeter for one, maybe two episodes. They instead fill the rest of the time just showing like a thousand photos of Derek Jeter. Once you've seen a dozen, you've seen them all. This documentary does NOT help the stereotype of baseball being boring, because this was too boring to even just have on in the background while I'm on the internet."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"Derek Jeter was always an enigma. Some fans practically worshipped him (and what he represented to the Yankees and baseball in general), while others found reasons to pick him apart both on-field and off it. Jeter, being notoriously tight-lipped, never really contributed to those opinions one way or another. Until now--perhaps the first time ever Jeter has been so forthright about his life/career. In truth, his honesty and straightforwardness ends up being the hallmark of the entire experience in ""The Captain"".Covering Derek's life from childhood to Miami Marlins ownership (and a little beyond), series producer Kevin Carey does a remarkable job stitching it all together. He is helped by two main factors:First, Jeter's brutal honesty about all manner of topics. One may not like #2's opinions on all things, but there is absolutely no doubt that he has a discipline and conviction that is unmatched by most. I actually gained a lot of respect for him from watching this, or at very least understand why his career was perceived how it was.Secondly, there is the nostalgia factor of Jeter having played in what I consider the last era in which the general American sporting public still really cared about baseball (especially the postseason variety). It probably helps that his career started just as I was beginning to fall in love with the sport. Though I of course pseudo-""hated"" him at the time (as a Twins fan), I eventually gained the utmost respect for his on-field play. So, seeing all the roughly 1996-2004 material was pure nostalgia for me.Also, I enjoyed the focus on family throughout the doc. Jeter's parents and sister play a major role, as does wife Hannah in the final few episodes. It was very interesting to see ""family man Jeter"" and I found that material quite compelling for the way it portrayed a change (if slight and ongoing) in his overall character post-baseball career.The only two reasons I can't give ""The Captain"" a full 10/10 stars:-One episode unnecessarily (and somewhat embarrassingly) skewers a sportswriter for his opinion/comment on Jeter's biracial status. It would have been enough to just hear the guy out and present Jeter's comments on the matter, but the filmmakers here make it a point to absolutely hammer this individual into the ground. The one blip of overly PC-nature in the whole doc.-There are, on occasion, some blatantly cooked-up adverserial moments. With ""The Captain"" being modeled after ""The Last Dance"" (Jordan/Bulls doc that became highly acclaimed), it was as if the filmmakers had to shoe-horn in some ""Jordan reacts to a comment"" moments with Jeter, and it often feels odd or forced. Fortunately, Jeter handles those with his usual blunt honesty and comes away looking better than anyone.Overall, though, I found ""The Captain"" to be a riveting doc that held my interest all the way through. I can't say I agree with or share the same opinions as Jeter on certain things, but his honesty on all matters impressed me and worked well in shaping how this doc played out."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"The score is awful, plodding super serious strings sawing away, making it sound like the story will climax in the arrest of a serial killer. The story of Derek Jeter is just not interesting- incredibly paint by the numbers dull. Just dreadful."
中国机长,The Captain (2022– ),,2022,2019.10.18,"I watched it and it was interesting but not great. The Michael Jordan one was great, this one not so much. Very much like Jeter always felt calculated as a player in how his ""public persona"" was handled this documentary seemed very manufactured into ""what Jeter wanted you to take from it, as opposed to a real behind the scenes look"". Jordan's documentary was much better at getting to see the real Michael Jordan. Not that Jeter owes it to any of us to show the ""real Derek Jeter"" but if you put a documentary out there then don't script it. If you want privacy, go for it. If you want fame, go for it. But to me this felt like Jeter riding the yellow line and pushing a story that he wanted you to believe about him instead of a behind the scenes look of transparency. I didn't love this one. Would not be high on my list of recommendations. Felt very manufactured to me."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"A few years ago, South Korea brought us 'The Tower', which I absolutely loved. Hollywood brought us 'Only the Brave' in 2017, which I absolutely hated, and 'Backdraft 2' in 2019, which received such bad reviews that I have no interest in seeing it. Now China brings us 'The Bravest', which I absolutely loved.I've been in the mood for a disaster film of this caliber for a while now, and 'The Bravest' satisfied that need. The horror of a fire is so well demonstrated here, as well as the unpredictability of any fire. The visuals are impressive and the photography stunning, as well as very good cinematography.The film grabs you from the opening scene. Thereafter, there literally never is a dull moment, with action and suspense from beginning to end. Most firefighting films have a good climatic fire scene - here the scene lasts the duration of the entire film. Awesome! Apart from the action, the film also deals with chaos and panic that ensues in the face of disaster."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"Disaster movies - while technically not a genre, it is something that a lot of people enjoy. Well that may not be the right way to describe it. It is I guess about the trill, about the will to survive, about what humans are able to do and overcome to survive. And living through something exciting, without actually having to do it one self ... the characters on screen go through it all. Succesfully or not is a different story and may lead you to like this more or less, depending on your inclinations/expectations.Having said all that, the drama is high in this, but it does look amazing! The effects are great, the cinematography is as good as it can get and the soundtrack elevates it even a bit further. So if you are into these dramas, there is no way around this (and you probably will like this even more than what I rated it). Having said all that, it is up to you to decide if it floats your boat ... burns down your house? Well you know what I mean ..."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"Cringe worthy, some bad effects, horrible acting. Only China giving it good reviews. Truly appalling."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"This is far away a theatrial melodrama of dimensions, that gives you a pampered roller coaster ride of heroism and grief.its based on true happenings back in august 2015, and the film didnt mention that 170+ fatalities and 700 + injuries batteling the fire. far to little has leaked out on this incidenjt so we must embrace the film that has been made, because the fire and the action inbetween the saluting and words of wisdome are very well made.if you like firebattling in the danger zone, do watch this , the grumpy old man did. by all means recommended"
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,I loved the movie even more. Even with reading the subtitles I couldn't help but get engrossed in it. I definitely have to watch this again. I know I missed somethings due to my reading. Definitely a much watch movie.
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"The rigid propaganda film fully embodies the reality of the current system that only contends for contempt and only calls for rigid slogans, regardless of whether it is black and white. From the beginning, it shows a logical black hole. The firefighting needs to take the bridge. The fire brigade is set up unreasonably. The hot pot restaurant is on fire, which means that a lot of oil and water are fired."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,An amazing film based on real events. This is another Chinese movie in which I really cried! Every emotion in the movie captures my heart.
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"A great firefighting action movie. Ignore the negative nellies and watch it, you won't regret it."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"From the same producer that brought you Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, there is great cinematography and lots of action to keep you on the edge of your seat.Based on the real events in Tianjin 2015, a tribute to the heroic Firefighters who gave their lives.In a race against time, firefighters risk their lives to control the catastrophic oil pipeline fire that can escalate into a destructive magnitude greater than an atomic bomb. With the city in total chaos, people are fighting to leave the city in order to save their own lives. Jiang Liwei's wife and son prepare to leave the city, but in the chaos, his son is separated from his wife.At the same time, Jiang Liwei is struggling to erase the past where everyone blames him for another's death. He just wants to be a hero in everyone's eyes, especially in the eyes of his son. In his efforts to save the city from destruction, he risks life and limb to save everyone and loses his own life.'Although the film was in Mandarin, it provided accurate English subtitles as well as Chinese subs. I read the English subs the entire movie, but never missed any of the those great explosions or other action packed scenes.Bring tissues."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"THE BRAVEST accomplishes the extremely difficult feat of delivering stunning, edge-of-your-seat action along with intimate emotional moments and very appealing characters you can feel for and root for. Even though it's set in China and subtitled it feels absolutely universal, so you can lose yourself entirely in the story no matter where you're from. And it's not afraid to make you cry. First rate, eye-popping summer entertainment about real heroes rather than superheroes. A great time at the movies!"
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"This film was based on true events and shows that heroism exists no matter what country or color you are from. Those who deride this as ""propaganda"" need to open their minds instead of letting their ethnic prejudices pollute their thinking."
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,"Made in China, this film felt as big and action-packed and stylish as any Roland Emmerich (DAY AFTER TOMORROW) or Michael Bay (ARMAGEDDON) movie. Every scene had firefighters surrounded by walls of fire, explosions, collapsing buildings, flaming oil spills. It was really an amazing piece of movie making, I have no idea how they pulled off all the stunts and action. Everything looked VERY REAL that I was afraid for the actors, the scenes were that intense. The concept was cool and simple (slight spoiler here)--a fire starts at a port area in China, loaded with tanks of oil and chemicals. If some of the larger tanks explode, the blast and chemicals can wipe out the city--sending millions of people into a panic. We follow several main characters and one fire fighting squad trying to battle the blaze and cut off the flow of oil. A series of dramatic relationships get played out and kept my interest, but I was really just captivated by the stylish action and the smart way the stakes and danger kept increasing. It's a great example of what's going on outside the USA, the scope of the films and the great directors able to deliver mind blowing scenes and stunts.Not to spoil too much, the story follows a massive fire that starts"
烈火英雄,The Bravest (2019),,2019,2019.08.09,Movie was grt and very sad takes courage to serve likethis no matter what country
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"Ice snow and water make up the livibg room in this one. Seen in buck trousers, santino lifts the bajupers out some weights set over his neck. Its the triangle trussed rope that keeps puling him from the neck and into an unwanted day in the city."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"I don't know where the low ratings come from. This movie had excitement,tension, action,romance,great cinematography and was well edited. If you enjoy movies like Vertical Limit and Everest then you will love this. I had to write this review because I did not see how the rating was so low and it should be seen."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"The movie itself really shows strong determination of conquering not only the greatest odds of mountaineering on Everest but also the sacrifices that have to be made for the sake of achieving the ultimate goal for any mountaineer and so as for their country. This is where the movie shines by a lot. You'll it good flowing down your skin as you watch it.Where the movie doesn't shine? It's too unrealistic to be honest. The CGI made the location look odd compared to Western's Everest movies. The visual at the Everest are totally lacking realism to be honest. And also they made it way too dramatic and kinda long too to be honest.Nonetheless, it's still an okay movie to watch but I've seen better. Even so it's not bad nor best but rather mediocre movie that is still worth your spare time."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"Wait, there is another action movie about mountain climbing. Move over, Vertical limit. Although this movie was far to overdramatized I must admit it made the action scenes far more suspenseful and exciting. They were done well, not well enough to truly justify the IMAX ticket, but it still kept me on the edge of my seat so that's good.Plus, having Jackie Chan do a cameo is almost like an action film's seal of approval.It's a wining score for me"
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"Over 2 Hours of my life that I will not get back, waste of my movie ticket money and fuel to get there!!!.By far the most boring movie on Earth that I have ever watched. Did they really have to keep going up and down the mountain so many times and killing so many innocent lives in the process... Cheaply made.I booked this movie because I saw Jackie Chans name on it and he only appears there for 2 minutes at the end...he should really think about his reputation before putting his name onto a silly movie like this.Really really disappointed!!!"
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"You wasted 1 hour of screen time talking about love and romance, I never felt any kind of connection of the characters because there was no build up. So when they died, I felt nothing, even the love scenes were so cringy to watch. Jackie Chan was also a rip off, putting him in the movie trailer, but he only appeared less than 3 minutes is a cheap con to make people go watch it. I'd recommend watching Everest 2015 instead... now that's a realistic movie done well."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"The biggest discomfort of the film is the split of emotions, the paleness of the narrative, the frivolous emotions, and the strong sense of disappointment after the high expectations are lost. Not good enough. For a film of such a size and level as ""Climber"", it means ""bad"" by itself.After repeated reflection, the board should play on the play itself. From theme selection to character design to plot structure, and even logic, there are many problems.""Climber"" is undoubtedly the main theme, what to promote, what to sing, has already been set, and there is no need to create a team to work out.Two abrupt loves further blur the theme. The seemingly rich emotional expression did not separate the primary and secondary, so that the motivation of the protagonist in the film has been swinging between national honor, adventure enthusiasm and love.The most terrible thing is that the climax of the movie actually put the emotional outlet above ""love"". The final radio wave confession of Wu Jing and Zhang Ziyi completely diluted the sublimation of the summit. The grand propositions that had been accumulated before and after suddenly became a wood without roots In the end, one can only accumulate in the audience's heart, which is difficult to release."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"Pan Deng Zhe or The Climbers is a Chinese action-adventure movie inspired by historic events. The movie explores how a group of Chinese mountaineers attempts to ascend Mount Everest from the perilous north side. The film exposes the intense relationships between the mountaineers and the challenges related to the expedition.The movie has been shot on location in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The settings are therefore quite authentic and the landscapes are absolutely breathtaking. Lead actor Wu Jing conducted a cold tolerance training before the shooting and his dedication shows off in a convincing performance. The intense scenes on the mountain have been filmed with great care in form of emotional acting skills and impressive special effects.The movie also has a few downsides. The numerous highly emotional relationships between the members of the expedition feel somewhat exaggerated and only distract from the already fascinating main plot and the stunning mountaineering scenes. As many other Chinese productions, this film has also an extremely strong patriotic side as it's constantly claimed that Mount Everest is a Chinese mountain that must be climed by Chinese mountaineers which has to be proven and shown to the entire world.If you are willing to ignore the overtly emotional side stories and the strong propaganda, you will discover a good mountaineering film that should please fans of movies such as Vertical Limit. The settings and special effects alone are worth watching this movie as its high budget shows off quite impressively. To leave an even better mark, this movie should have had less dramatic side stories, less propaganda and more skilled actresses and actors."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"I love climbing movies and I saw Jackie Chan somewhere in the credits, so I sat down with a bottle of beer looking forward to enjoy this flick. What a waste of time!!!First of all, this movie looks like it's been made by a trashy filmmaker, if you can call them so, a filmmaker. Every technical detail is dreadful - the CGI is lousy, some shots look like they were taken with a low quality camera (such as a GoPro) so they stand out against the rest of the movie, the cast is painful to see because the director did not know how to make them perform well... There are many sensitive secuences that end up being sappy and cheaply overemotional because of the poor directing. The epic feat did not receive equal justice in the film as the over-the-top tone of the film becomes too propagandist and shallow. And using Jackie Chan as a bait, when he only performs a few minutes at the end of the movie, right after the first end credits, it's deceitful and sad.This is definitely a wasted opportunity. I haven't yet seen a great climbing movie (Everest and Werner Herzog's Scream of Stone, both fine flicks, could be the best ones I've seen so far), but The Climbers is such a bad movie I felt compelled to write this review.If you don't mind about climbing, don't waste your time, but if you do like climbing movies and you'll see it anyways, it's not going to be a pleasant watch. You've been warned."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"Not a bad movie. Not great either. As a climber myself I took into consideration that in those days the gear was nowhere near as advanced and strong as the gear these days. Though on a couple of thigs I was laughing as the way the gear failure was portrayed was laughable. A good excuse for a bit of Kung Fu type gymnastics and action to be thrown in. The acting was wooden and we didn't really care about any particular character because they all blended into a mess of ""Try your best to keep up"". I think I fell asleep for 20 minutes but didn't miss anything when I rewound it. I give it a 5 because the action scenes were well done (though unbelievable). If it was a Hollywood film I'd give it 3 or 4."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,It thought it was pretty entertaining. Great story and well acted. The filmography was very realistic.
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"I thought it was a good movie.I do like these kind of movies.The lead star was like a superhero climber.He was too good. It had action drama, romance if you can call it that. The movie is subtitled and they speak Mandarin Chinese."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"""The Climbers"" is an unashamedly nationalistic film. Indeed, I don't recall ever seeing so many flags in one feature.Its focused on China's efforts to climb Mt Everest, conquering the North face.In terms of watch-ability its entertaining but hardly factual. A lot of the action is over the top, by any standards. That said, the cinematography is decent and the scenes, well choreographed.In terms of story its once again, unsurprisingly, a patriotic affair. Lots of self sacrifice in the name of China's greater glory. Nothing too offensive but one I suspect, that was scripted predominantly with local audiences, in mind.6/10."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"He can fly through the air over a vast crevasse and save his entire climbing team from surefire icy death, he can save the damsel in distress by using his manly back to block a ten ton ice shard from falling on his beloved princess, he can run the 3 minute assault course in 2 min 30 secs - Yes Fang Wuzhou is the Chinese superman - Fang Wuzhou is the man!!!Ok so the film is more fantastical in some respects than one would expect in the West but I think that adds to the enjoyment of the movie and makes it more fantasy and fun and reminiscent of the days of movies like Sinbad & The Eye Of The Tiger and other gloriously over the top fantasy movies. Yes it is of course political and patriotic but that seems to be the Chinese way and to be honest as long as the movie entertains I am not too bothered with that.The acting to me seems well over the top but I am not Chinese so can only judge from a western viewpoint; I am sure the Chinese viewers think it is perfectly a cinematic normal for them. I did find the romance angle very well done and even had a tear in my eye at the end but then again I am a bit of a big Jessie when it comes to these things. It is very different from what westerners perceive as romance ie The Chinese seem to veer more to the ""treat em mean, keep em keen"" and that is probably more realistic than our view of romance to be fair but it did still have me in Big Girls Blouse mode lol.Poor old Fang Wuzhou I did feel for him in the end and if a movie can elicit some emotion from the viewer then it cannot be half bad!Unlike the recent Scifi disasters from China I actually did quite enjoy this.The special effects and CGI are quite realistic and thrilling in a different way than Vertical Limit was; I still prefer Vertical Limit, Cliffhanger or Everest but it is a decent nights viewing and certainly does not deserve less than an average 5/10. It almost gets an extra star for the Chinese Superman Fang Wuzhou! Long live Fang Wuzhou!!!!"
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"This is a good movie based on historical events with lots of good drama, romance and action, even though sometimes it feels like you´re watching Stallone´s Cliffhanger because a lot of the action sequences are Over the top. Good acting, score and cinematography, too."
攀登者,The Climbers (2019),,2019,2019.09.30,"This was a decent mountaineering movie with thorough scientific and meteorological research to make it believable. And most of the events are based on actual people and events.The movie has a beautiful blend of CGI and actual mountain scenery.I love how they used actual Tibetan actors to add in the diversity and realism of the movie.Wu Jing is believable as an experienced mountaineer. And as a action star himself, I am glad there were added Hollywood-esque type of action sequences that didn't felt off and was exciting to watch.I like how they not call it Mount Everest, but the original Tibetan name, Qomolangma. As a sign of not whitewashing the history of the mountain.As for criticism that the movie has a propaganda tone to it. You have to understand the movie is a period piece, and at that time many projects were ordered and endorsed by the central chinese government. So the nationalistic feel to the operation is somewhat realistic for the time and should be protrayed as such.Fun Fact: Xia Boyu who got both of its legs amputated as shown in the movie, actually did got to climbed the mount everest again for at lest 5 times with artifical limbsChinese mountaineering has been left under the radar and have not gotten enough exposure as it deserves over the years. With this movie they bring honor to those who have fallen conquering the mountain.The protagonist Wang Fuzhou died in 2015 but left an impression as a chinese mountaineering pioneer."

银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"The movie is extremely relatable for Chinese, both raised in the Western world and those raised in Asia. I highly highly recommend it.Expectations of parents, role of father figure, what it means to grow up and pursue our own dreams... this movie is easily the best movie of 2019. Throughout the film, the director inspires, relates, and motivates the audience to become better a better Chinese, and shows the work in China towards making Chinese peolp"
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,Such a pleasure to watch a film about a young boy being inspired by his hard-working Father who was challenged many times without giving up and taught this valuable lesson to his son! Loved it!!
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"I think if you saw this movie on a plane, it would be far more emotional, but I saw it in my lounge. Anyway, Looking Up is ambitious but also has some repetitious and lagging parts. Still, its heart is in the right place for sure. The usual plot devices are there, with the inspiring ending that will restore your faith in home-school education combined with state schooling.If Americans remade this movie, I'd imagine Will Ferrell would play the father."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"It want to criticize the exam-oriented education, but It can't get the truthful evidence; It want to render the father and son love, but it is shaped into a broken family poison record; It want to use the space special effects to improve the grade, but tear the plot and lick the lips. The traditional old-fashioned mother, the step-father who is busy making money, the father who is eager to compensate, the child who is rebellious against the heart, this combination can enter the top 10 according to the way in the photo. It is really a god-given opportunity, and it is recommended to hurry into the mountain to practice."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"Watched it on the airplane. Well exceeded my expectation. Asians, especially Chinese may relate better due to similar culture and social background. The love between father and son is very touching. The purpose or the choosing of life or career is proposed well which is also inspiring."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"I cried like a baby on the plane while watching this because it was so powerful! Incredible film, SO well done. I will recommend this film to anyone I know. So SO SO heartwarming and inspiring"

银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"We really enjoyed the movie. It is touching, and exciting. I have never felt that I'm bored during the movie. There was always some emotions or excitement. It does not feel like classic space movies, this one has very good emotional connection. I believe this movie deserves at least a solid 7. If you are interested in this type, it might be higher than 7/10."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"It was a bit disjointed and the story went from here to there without much in the way of explanation. Out of all the Chinese films I have watched, this is probably my least favourite.It isn't a bad film and I wouldn't not recommend giving this a go, it isn't my cup of tea - you might just like thisn and relate to it but I think 5/10 is a reasonable mark for me."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"The title of the film ""brainwashing dad"" may be more appropriate. As Ren Suxi said in the film, Ma Haowen exudes a temperament of brainwashing organization from beginning to end. This is not about Deng Chao's performance, but the problems that arise in the script and character design stage. He taught his son that he could do everything on earth and live up to his expectations. His son became the successor of ""space wolf"" Liu Peiqiang, but he almost selfishly sacrificed his father's wish for his dream. Is this education really successful? Maybe the screenwriter himself has no answer, so he can only rely on ""being a father for the first time in this life"" in ""please answer 1988"" to force a happy ending. Deng Chao and Yu Baimei held their breath this time and wanted to be ashamed before the snow, so they piled up countless emotional points and themes, combined with the embarrassing nostalgic Golden Melody string burning, and finally presented a hodgepodge. Director Yan is the best in the audience. Unfortunately, this character is too Facebook, and Deng Chao is too hard. It's not easy to copy Xu Zheng's success and win the movie emperor. We can see that Deng Yu and Yu have corrected their creative attitude. No way to black is the premise of making a good film."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"The movie confuses me. It is alternating between reality and fairy tale throughout, without convincing me with either. I agree with the other reviewers, the father character, with all good intentions both from the film maker and in the story, is not real, at all, almost felt as if he had multiple personality. He promised things clearly impossible, which was the tale; while his story with the jail and all, was reality. I am not saying this cannot work, but the film did not pull it off. The son character was rather bland, yet making strange moves that did not fit the character. The story is weak with non-impressive acting."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,A lot of important Quotes can be taken and it includes life lessons. Show the importance of good parenting (to have hope in your kids). It is a bitter sweet movie! 😭
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"Some stereotypical characterisations - the stepfather and the headmaster being obvious ones. One dreadful scene with the headmaster breaking down and seemingly undergoing a transformation subsequently, that was truly laughable. The bridge collapse likewise.A major theme of the movie is the education system and the pressure and joyless rote learning of subjects - learning of facts without understanding or creativity - and promoting learning by challenge and discovery. It was heavy handed in the psychology, and pretty naive overall.6 stars is tops for this - I enjoyed it overall, basically because I study China and Mandarin, but occasionally cringed."
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"Best movie I've ever SEEN! So far in the movie industry, more movies like this and I will slowly heartily fall dead, it is so amazing! It is specially done for young viewers, teenagers and adults who want some good inspiration. I Rate 10/10 !! Thanks IMDb!"
银河补习班,Looking Up (2019),,2019,2019.07.19,"This movie had great relationship themes between a father and sonThe extremes of the child being young and beholden to his talented father to becoming a mission saving hero and the father being a talented but flawed engineer trying to recover was excellentSure there were probably some big flaws and stereotypes but it was a story of love and devotion and growing up and giving hope.The scene of Chinese nationalism, portraying the different parts of the country as one, were grating but lasted for a couple of minutes, certainly not enough to spoil the tale being toldLoved it"
反贪风暴,P Storm (2019),,2019,2019.04.04,"This one is far much better than the first one (Z Storm). I gave Z 5 points, and this one 7 points."
反贪风暴,P Storm (2019),,2019,2019.04.04,The story is so lame that it's like watching a really really fake movie. Looks like they didn't have anything to do and just decided to make up a story and make a movie out of it. The acting was good though.
反贪风暴,P Storm (2019),,2019,2019.04.04,"It is tedious to see Koo in every of the HK film. Not that he has default in his acting, but we need some new faces to refresh our interest. Having said that I do appreciate what Koo has done to our society and in entertainment circle. He is the chairman of actors' union. He helps a lot of actors in need and in sickness. His contribution to society is beyond doubt.Come back to the movie, its plot is ok. Acting of supporting lead is satisfactory. Not a bad time killer."
反贪风暴,P Storm (2019),,2019,2019.04.04,"Well, I just finished watching all 4 movies in the ""Storm"" franchise that have come out so far, in one go, in chronological order. In my opinion, Z Storm was boring, S Storm was passable, L Storm was good, and this one was decent. The plot in this one is probably the less elaborate plot out of all the plots in the 4 movies, but the characters and acting in this one is on point (for once), and there's plenty of action. It was also fun to see one of the minor bad guys from the first movie, Z Storm, return in this one. L Storm is still my favourite in the franchise so far, but I liked this one as well. Strangely enough, this franchise doesn't seem to follow the cliche of the sequels being worse than the originals. I'd say L Storm and P storm are both much better than S Storm, and especially, Z Storm, so in this case the later movies are the better ones. In my opinion that is. Now to wait for the fifth movie, G Storm, whenever that comes out. I wonder just how many of these they intend to make, lol. :-P"
反贪风暴,P Storm (2019),,2019,2019.04.04,"After the sad mess that was L Storm, P Storm surprisingly arrived in theatres barely a year later. And they brought back nearly everyone from L Storm, which might have been a shame. Thankfully, the plot holes aren't as bad, since this instalment literally takes place in a jail.Raymond Lam is the TVB bad guy of the show, and in a movie chock full of every police cliche ever, manages to surprise with the amount of effort he puts in to make his character despicable and utterly mean from his first scene, a feat no villain in the Storm series certainly achieved. Gordon Lam's arrested cop returns from Z Storm in a rare bit of continuity, and showcases cliched attempts at revenge. While he does turn good at the end, I would have liked it if he had learnt better while in there. Adam Pak returns fresh from his Hong Kong Film Awards nomination for L Storm as a newbie police officer, and he is servicable for the little amount of screen time. Poor Liu Kai-chi returns once again, which is sad considering how good he was in ""Project Gutenberg"". Louis Cheung also returns to provide welcome warmth and comic relief in the cold prison cell, and demonstrates surprising dramatic ability that might be considered wasted in these cliched shows. What do I know, since this movie made over 700 million yuan in China? I know there's going to be a G Storm coming next year, and I sincerely hope it won't take us back to L Storm levels of bad."
追龙2：追缉大富豪,Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch (2019),,2019,2019.06.07,An ok distraction. Over the top melodramatic Hong Kong cop flick. A bit of fun.
追龙2：追缉大富豪,Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch (2019),,2019,2019.06.07,"Dont ask the acting, hongkong veteran actor here.. nice plot fun action, dont know why so many hated this movie.. Underrated movies.. much better than any latest hongkong movie i watched.."
追龙2：追缉大富豪,Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch (2019),,2019,2019.06.07,"Two years ago, Chasing the Dragon, starring Hong Kong stars Andy Lau and Donnie Yen, was a gritty crime movie of epic proportions. This sequel, entitled Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch, features none of these famous actors, is about half an hour shorter and only an above average thriller that is loosely connected to the first part. The movie revolves around undercover cop Sky who inflitrates the gang of criminal mastermind Logan. The veteran attempts to kidnap an influential millionaire in Macao before retiring to Hawaii. Sky has to gain the mastermind's trust step by step but soon becomes a pawn in his game. Things get even more complicated when Sky realizes that some gang members have their own secret ambitions.Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch convinces with gripping action scenes leading to an intense finale. The three main characters consisting of the protagonist undercover cop, the antagonist criminal mastermind and the gang member with his own ambitions are fleshed out very well and complement one another perfectly. The story comes around with a few minor turns to keep things entertaining throughout. The film's rock soundtrack is catchy, contemporary and energetic as it even made me discover great new music. Sabrina Qiu and Lukian Wang look particularly stylish, elegant and beautiful as the movie's only relevant actresses.The movie however lacks the charismatic presence of Andy Lau and Donnie Yen that made the first movie stand out. The actors and actresses in this film only deliver good average performances at best and lack energy and charisma. The film's pace is at times quite slow in the introduction and especially the middle section at the criminals' hideout is rather dragging. Occasional flashbacks further harm the pace. Despite a few minor twists, the plot is overall rather unspectacular and can be decsribed as Hong Kong action-thriller by the numbers. The locations are also tedious and mostly consist of the hideout and random highways.In the end, Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch is a classic Hong Kong action-thriller that will keep you entertained for just above one hour and a half. It however fails to leave a deeper impression due to a lack of charismatic actors, interesting locations and gripping plot. This film never equals the first movie and is only recommended to faithful genre fans."
追龙2：追缉大富豪,Chasing the Dragon II: Wild Wild Bunch (2019),,2019,2019.06.07,"With 4 Hong Kong Oscar winners, the acting of male leads are beyond doubt captivating. Its story is not bad. The plot is sensible. I particularly like the look of tycoon Lee and his son, which resembles the real figures.It is a film worth watching, only that it is a bit boring when you see Koo appears in every Hong Kong film."
受益人,My Dear Liar (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"The story of the little person is really easy to touch. The story is straight and flawless. But the critique of reality has been completely abandoned. In the film, in fact, both male characters are floating in the air, but the heroine slowly falls to the audience."
受益人,My Dear Liar (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"My Dear Liar is definitely not Da Peng's finest work, but it is still distinctively his. A not so funny comedy but a heartfelt love story that is elevated by the brilliant work by Liu Yan. Never would I thought that she is able to deliver such a tantalizing performance, morphing herself into a character that is so believable."
受益人,My Dear Liar (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"Absurdity of black humor comedy obsessive, think the punchline is higher sense of these were no acosmia joke amused don't don't of, the scene plot and sometimes warm and sometimes dark, the mood also follow ups and downs, naturally compact plot let you call, close range shots and chongqing dialect is undoubtedly a major highlight of the film, when the actors online + score was just right, the subject has a realistic meaning, you will sigh is more than two hours of visual feast. This is a heavy topic, through the packaging of black humor, the life of the little people forced to the last lamenting the real meaning of true love than money jumped on the paper."
受益人,My Dear Liar (2019),,2019,2019.11.08,"This is the one which combined with the evilest thinking and the most heart-touched spirit. I have to commit there are still some flaws in the film, but it is an undoubted good movie."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"The movie obviously plays into the patriotic sentiment of the chinese people. For me personally, it was especially beautiful when it showed the difference in thinking of 2 generations of Chinese volleyball players. One was all about patriotic emotion backed hard training, limited resources and technology, the other one was about love for volleyball, personal pursuit and reaching dreams. Both teams were winners. The transformation in 30 years echoes with the changing lifestyle and thinking's of the chinese people. Well done!"
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"China women national team always be my first watch team when I'm a teenage, being watching vb for 30 years make me irresistible to watch this movie in theater for sure.The storyline is focus on Jenny Lang Ping and Chen Zhonghe for the past 40 years. The first hour is amazing lead by 2 non actors, one is Lang Ping real daughter, Lydia Bai, and another is a volleyball player Chen Zhan. On some level their acting is very natural and very moving for how the team got the first championship in history. In terms of the real-ness including the training environment and method of the coach, even the scene of tournament, it's close enough to the reality. For the first hour of story, I rate indeed an 8.When time move to 2008, story turns to Chen Zhonghe head coach era. The disappointment then begins. It totally describes wrongly and act differently in the movie about Chen. The character is totally different from the real person. Chen is nothing like that and I believe all vb fans agreed on this. Even the real Chen complained on this that ""dirty-ify"" his image, I agree no more.The post 2013 era becomes the players focus. It's little dramatic and that part also act by many non actors but real vb players. I would say it's hard to fit but can see players acting is something rare to see. I won't expect much but only enjoy watching real vb players act.Overall speaking, the wrong description on Chen is the biggest failure on this movie. That part I only rate 4. Thus I give a 6 at the end. Some details may not be accurate but many are good enough especially the match scene and many well known retired players were seen, this part already priceless."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,The volleyball player is real in film without any acting experience.Peter Ho-sun Chan Director really a genius in catching each character real emotion on screen. Great tempo keep u awake till the end of film. Great edit between colour present and grey past time.Great performance by Gongli to portray the coach by following the real Lang Ping for weeks to observe and copy her every emotion and gesture..
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"Deserve higher rating and perfectly directed and portrayed by talented actors and professional athletes.Highly recommended for all to watch.But for a Chinese, it's simply a must as it presents an era and national spirit!"
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"This was a wonderful sports movie for anybody who appreciates volleyball or appreciate sports in general. This was quite an excellent film, granted it was sponsored by the CCP and it was very obvious that it was a patriotic film about the greatness of China, but from a purely objective point of view who can argue with what China has achieved in the past 30 years? Toxic government or not.As an non partisan American I can stand back and appreciate what they've done and for me this movie was more about characters and strategy and individuals, than it was about the state. This film was very good, it packed a lot of emotion and the magnificent Gong Li was her amazing self. What a presence she is.The entire cast was great, I recommend this film. Uplifting for sure."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,It is actually a movie depicting the life of our greatest Chinese volleyball heroin
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,Better than expected. Really amazed that the real volleyball players are involved.
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"It took a lot of research to re-enact the 1980's training ground.The games, Bai Lang's acting, the volleyball players ex and current all acted well.But perhaps it is difficult to portrait coach Lang Ping. Even without her professional ball skills and built, her charisma and focus is hard to duplicate.Gong can only try stare hard but well attempts.Her hair styling is also a joke.If Chen Kexin is willing to cast wife Wu Junru as lead. I am sure Wu will study Lang Ping's character well.Next to nothing, Gong Li is the only middle age known actress in China. Just wondering if Wu or Michelle Yeoh could have done a better job.Or if coach Lang Ping could act as her older self.Touching movie, great scene setup, great movie angle n wonderful cast."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"""Take great care of your knees and legs.""This was a memorable piece of advice I read from a top ten list of most common advice from old people. This tip was constantly on my mind throughout Leap, a film about the Chinese Women's Volleyball team, where the female players continually jump, dive, and slam their joints on the gym floor in its unrelentingly grueling training sequences.Director Peter Chan, who is a master of telling intimate stories using the little details, captures the generational spirit of the Chinese Women's Volleyball starting from Deng Xiaoping's China going through economic reform in the 1980s onto the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Leap functions like a mosaic, using both the macro and the micro to show the 30-year history of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team. This rule-bending approach was executed superbly as it retains both the epic and the intimate qualities of the narrative. A screenwriting teacher would teach that it's essential to have a clear protagonist and the film ticks that box loosely with Lang Ping and Chen Zhonghe, the current and former head coach of Women's Volleyball. Ultimately, the main character in Leap is the team itself.The stakes are high in these matches. The volleyball matches featured in Leap recreate the exact Olympic matches, with the help of the current Chinese Women's National Volleyball Team. The matches are thrilling and executed with a historic accuracy down to the very last detail, as if the film was a historical re-enactment itself.Along with all the best sports movies out there, Peter Chan lets the audience viscerally experience the infectious power of sports and how a victory really can bring up a nation's spirit, as we've seen in Dangal for India, or Invictus for South Africa or Rocky IV for the US.Gong Li plays Lang Ping in a straight non-showy way with a full awareness that she is just one small cog in a larger machine. She has the easier job actually. Lydia Bai, the actress who plays the young version of Lang Ping, actually does more of the physical heavy lifting in the first half establishing the Lang Ping character in her athletic years.When Huang Bo showed up as the head coach Cheng Zhonghe, I was a bit worried he may have been miscast because of his natural comic sensibilities. Any line that comes out of Huang Bo's mouth naturally transforms into a punchline. Thankfully, that didn't happen too often. Huang Bo adds warmth and tenderness that helps ground the movie. Whenever the story starts to be about the country for too long and starts forgetting about its characters, Huang Bo and Gong Li helped snap it back into place.Like a history teacher speeding through a lesson, Leap is busy-minded and rapidly edited. It helps to sit in the back row, which I didn't. Often, it's blink and you'll miss it. If you're watching at home, the pause button may be your friend.The pace of how subtitles and title cards live and die within a blink of an eye in Chinese films and I wish they were given more time to breathe. The general rule is you should be able to read the card twice.Leap is well done. It's ambitious and yet it hits its mark as both a thrilling sports film and also an inspiring historical biopic that captures an era."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"As usual, it's not for humanity but for a nationalism pride.It'd be a normal movie if it's about a school team, a special group, or any leagues. However, it's a state-supported exertion without considering budget, any pains, sacrifice of families, and/or personal traumas afterwards.Different from other China pride genus, though, this movie subtly used a lot of tricks to hide its real purposes instead of directly speaking loud of the patriotism, by copying some know-hows from western counterparts seeing from similar ones like ""The Way Back"", etc."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"Great historical sports drama providing some interesting insights into Chinese society - as well as competitive sports in the International Community at large - exploring sensitive and delicate personal and national issues.As depicted in this pretty intense biographical sports drama, competitive sports in China - such as volleyball - is not entirely unpolitical; the film highlighting the terrific volleyball clash between China and Japan in 1980; and between China and the US at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, in my opinion, the human aspects - such as the trials and tribulations of human existence and the triumph of the human spirit - certainly outweigh the petty political rivalries between nations; which are often regrettably epitomised in competitive sports.As emphasized in this great historical film, winning should not be most important thing, but rather the love for the game - as well as the adventure, friendship and learning process when engaging in competition and friendly rivalry with another nation."
夺冠,Leap (2020),,2020,2020.09.25,"Amazing movie that really showcases the grit and determination of a beloved national sports hero. It's Ana amazing story and an amazing movie made so because it's a true story. Definitely one to watch, you won't regret it."

长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"In China, anyone insulting martyr is likely to be put into prison. But this one has priviledge not to do so.This one's too illogical double-standarded and ridiculous illogical."
长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"This movie and its prequel, both are for the purpose to inspire the Chinese patriotism for the 1.4 billion subjects under the tight control of the CCP regime. The Chinese Communist Party has found their reign over its people has dwindled by several foreign influences:1) The internet. All the lies, all the rewritten historical facts by them are exposed on the internet. They are losing control over their once obedient slave-like citizens. The internet has bad influence that endangered the stability of its once tamed subjects who begin to open their eyes and can think by themselves more freely.2) The overlooked impact to allow their once brainwashed people to travel abroad. The open-gate policy allowing the Chinese people witnessed the democratic systems, the freedom of speech, freedom to think logically.3) The influences by joined the WTO. Trading with the free world, not just with goods, but also thoughts.There are more reasons to alarm the CCP to take emergent measures to retract and refrain its subjects back to the iron cage to be re-brainwashed and re-educated with their lies. How? The easiest and most effective method is through media propaganda, i.e., the movie industry.Thus came with the new wave of patriotic movie productions one after another. To make their people re-ignite their blind, blood-boiled patriotism and the hatred to all the democratic countries, especially the United States and Japan. ""The Battle at Lake ChangJin (2021)"" and its sequel, ""Water Gate Bridge (2022) movies were churned out with several other supporting ones, such as ""Snipers (2021)"", ""My Country, My Parents (2021)"", ""My People, My Homeland (2020)"", ""The Sacrifice (2020)"", ""The Eight Hundred (2020)"", ""Hi, Mom (2021)"" and so on. All of these movies are produced with one goal: To rekindle the dying and waning patriotism and loyalty to CCP and stabilize the infrastructure of Communist China. All of the above listed movies were enjoy fantastic success in box office. Record tickets selling were kept breaking, simply in China. Patriotism is always a good sale in China and only in China. High 5 to CCP, you did it and did it again, and again. Long live the CCP, long live the Communism in Chinese Style!"
长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"This war movie bounces between action scenes and emotional scenes. Much like other movies in the ww2 era, guns, grenades, bloods, and tears.It might sound dull for an artwork. However, for front line soldiers in a war, the battleground might not be much different. Fight, mourn, fight more, mourn more, ... If this movie manages to show that two hours of that is already kind of boring, how about two weeks, two months, two years, or two decades in real life and in fear?Disclosure: I am a pacifist who has spent an equal amount of adult life in both of the throat-cutting states in this movie."
长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"Almost as engaging as the first movie. The action is as good, if not better than the previous movie. The characters that the audience knows and loves from the previous movie return.This time, however, they won't stay, so to speak. That is also why for me personally this movie was less enjoyable than the previous one. The previous one ended on a more optimistic note, which is rare in Chinese entertainment (especially Chinese war movies), so I enjoyed that divergence immensely, but this movie is threading the well-known path towards the bittersweet ending. It's still good, but more by the books."
长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"Given the cultural bias imposed by the English language in Singapore, most Chinese Singaporeans who know about the Korean War have formed their views reading Western sources. If you ever want to break out of just being a footnote to global Western cultural dominance, and acquire a sense of self, it is very important to expand your horizons by connecting with the non-Western viewpoint, be that Chinese, Iranian, Russian, Korean etc Watch this movie (Parts 1 & 2) not just for the action and stories of sacrifice of the CPV, but also for a non-Western perspective."
长津湖之水门桥,Water Gate Bridge (2022),,2022,2022.02.11,"It's Steven John Venn, being in the film itself i must say they did a really good job on editing and special effects. For a 2D film it really made it seem like it was a 3D film with the effects."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,I almost knew nothing going into this movie. Didn't even watch the trailer just read a little about the synopsis and damn was I surprised. This movie was a helluva roller coaster of emotions!This movie is mostly set in 2013 and tells the harrowing story of an orphaned older brother and sister trying to find their way and survive in the bustling cut throat concrete jungle of Shenzhen... One of China's busiest cities.Not going to lie was not expecting the emotional punch or journey this movie took me thru. I actually cried a couple times and the less I say about that the better. One thing I WILL say tho is this movie had a TON of heart.The love btwn the characters absolutely shines thru. Some of the situations may seem hard to believe but I've been to China multiple times and know they are ALL very plausible. Def an under appreciated gem and I hope it gets more buzz at is a movie worth watching 🙏
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"One of the best movies I have watched this year. It reminds the movie Pursuit Of Happiness starring Will Smith, but the life difficulties he goes through and story feels much more alive. English language wasn't available nevertheless it was worth watching even with the subtitles."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"Yeah this movie has it all. If you just want a movie to get you to laugh and cry, feel inspired and feel helpless, then this is for youGreat acting, visuals were decent, overall just a good movie."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"This kind of movie is like listening to a successful speech. When you listen to it, the blood is boiling, but after listening to it, it is too smooth to think about it. The protagonist met so many employees who worked wholeheartedly for him, and in the end, everyone succeeded. It was really a miracle like the title of the film. Douban can't open up the discussion and reduce it by another star."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"It's no surprised that this Chinese theme film is nonrealistic. And it's hard to let audiences believe what cured the little sister's illness, especially there is no scene filming about the relationships between the doctor and the patient's family people. It is absolutly lack the real life experience.But the beauty of the buildings and the hard work of the cleaners formed a very strong contrast. In the film language that could not be clearly stated, the director gave us a real China image."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"The storyline is pretty predictable, we can make a guess that it will be HE with a guaranteed success but the casts actually did a good job telling the story."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"Cheap rip off of ""the pursuit of happyness"" , predicable, and definitely not based on true story, trying too hard to make viewers believe that is a based on true inspiring story. 4 stars for the ""nice views"" of the city and landscape. Unnecessary action scenes ruining the immersion."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"When their mother passed away, 20-year-old Jing Hao swore that he would take care of his young sister. Tongtong (Chen Halin) had congenital heart disease, and for the past six years, her doctor had been advising Jing Hao that she needed to have corrective surgery done before she reached eight years old, or else her condition will be more difficult for her.However, between his cellphone repair shop and various other odd jobs, Jing Hao simply could not earn the needed money. He needed to think outside the box, gambling on crazy ideas that no one had tried before. He relied on his meticulous technical skill, never say die attitude and good relations with his neighbors to make his bold plan materialize.Lead actor Jackson Yee is a multimedia superstar in Taiwan. His first big international movie break happened in 2019 when his film ""Better Days"" was nominated for an Oscar award. This year, he starred in two of the biggest box-office hits in China, ""The Battle at Lake Changjin II"" (currently #5 in the worldwide list) and ""Nice View"". Yee's portrayal of Jing Hao is sincere and earnest, inspirational to watch without being melodramatic."
奇迹笨小孩,Nice View (2022),,2022,2022.03.18,"In Chinese, we have ""Li(Li can be written in Shi Li or Shi Le) Zhi"" in another way: losing your mind(Shi Le Zhi). I think this best describing the movie.I have a Christian relative with CHD(The disease of the mother in the movie), who is prevented from giving birth to any children due to such birth defect, but it has been shown that the CHD mother died years after giving birth to two children(the elder is 20 while the younger 8), it's too illogical to believe that it were a documentary film describing the struggles of ordinary people.The fatal defect stopped the idiot to be the best instead of the worst."
这个杀手不太冷静,Too Cool to Kill (2022),,2022,2022.02.28,"Everyone has a dream, and some people are willing to be humble for their dreams. I admire such people. The downside is that the spark between the leading actor and actress is not credibly portrayed in order to avoid clichés, which makes the leading actor's final decision to risk his life to save people a little unconvincing."
这个杀手不太冷静,Too Cool to Kill (2022),,2022,2022.02.28,"The movie theater was filled with laughter due to the skillful performance of Ma Li and Wei Xiang. We can always believe in their acting. It seems that the script was adapted from a Japanese movie, thus the production crew had enough time to refine the setting and plot to make them attractive. The only goal of the movie is to make you laugh and obviously it succeeded. But the jokes are simple and direct so that you will not want to watch it for a second time. Anyway, congratulations to Wei Xiang on his first leading role in a movie. He is a good actor and deserves more attention and praise."
这个杀手不太冷静,Too Cool to Kill (2022),,2022,2022.02.28,This movie is good and it's really funny. It has some really original ideas and gags and the actors (the protagonist here has is first role as protagonist) are all good.I think that it could inspire a remake in Hollywood and other countires.

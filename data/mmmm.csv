英雄,hero,,2004,2004," One of the most beautiful and cinematically flooring movies you will ever see.  The director and fight choreographer produced perfection, and I feel this is Jet Li's best movie.            "

Through this film, Zhang Yimou not only creates a terrifically entertaining martial arts action film, but he also creates a film that is a moving and stirring look at the unification of China and the sacrifices that went into that monumental step.With beautiful cinematography to soak up every inch of the screen, Hero shows an adept use of shot composition and construction to go along with the cinematography. Used in conjunction, the significant moving pieces of each shot and the capturing of those moves creates a truly gorgeous film that is breathtaking to view. From beginning to end, Zhang's film presents a unique and melodic look at its action. Personally, my favorite shot comes when our nameless warrior (Jet Li) enters the palace of the King of Qin (Chen Daoming). The long shots in this sequence are incredible and truly soak up the entirety of the beauty of the location.Additionally, Zhang's constant use of color in the film is incredible, namely in the battle between Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Moon (Zhang Ziyi). The changing color of the leaves is an incredible site and the significance unashamedly escapes me, but is a beautiful use of color all the same. When it comes to the battles, the Zhang's use of color emerges continuously and it is always incredible to view.Now, of course, the main focus of these types of films are the battle sequences. As the film progresses, each battle sequence takes on new meaning, but is always steeped in Chinese culture and the Chinese concept of honor. These ideals, along with the ideals of a warrior, blend perfectly into terrific choreography of each fight with good special effects throughout. For those unfamiliar with wuxia films, seeing people flying can be a bit much. However, Zhang keeps this supernatural element restrained with a deeply human story and deeply human battles. Though they have unusual abilities, their hearts and souls and apparent for all to see.(SPOILERS) Thematically, Hero's beauty is continued with a terrific take on the power of hatred. Driven to assassinate the King of Qin due to the King's killing of his family, the nameless warrior manages to overcome his hatred due to Broken Sword (Tony Leung). Moved by his words, ""Our Land"", the warrior is unable to kill the King because he now understands the motives behind his attempts to unify China. Though he is killed for this, the scene of their mutual understanding is beautiful and wonderfully scripted. However, the film continues on this theme as it shows Flying Snow kill Broken Sword due to his refusal to kill the King. Upon killing her love, she realizes just what her hate brought her: personal anguish. Zhang's execution of this theme is wonderful to watch and underscores the brilliance of Hero, which transcends borders and is a deeply human film, not just one aimed at Chinese audiences.Overall, Hero is a beautifully crafted film that really shows its beauty in its cinematography, color, choreography, and in its themes. This is a masterful film from director Zhang Yimou that showcases all of the best qualities of wuxia genre, while also balancing the more unnatural elements with a deeply human story that is relatable for all.… Expand            "

Because its aI was very impressed by HERO, the movie runs in a way like Rashomon (Kurosawa's famous masterpiece that came out in 1950) (although under a completely different concept) - almost entirely through flashbacks during narration. Because its a period film about a very much fantastic and romanticized time, the dreamy quality of the photography is brilliantly suited. The look of the film is fabulous, although it sometimes indulges in video game beauty (the fight scene on the lake, the waterfall fight, and the calligraphy sequence that could be a shampoo commercial), just as Zhang the director indulges in melodrama, especially in the second half of the film, which is filled with slow-motion shots of people running and crying and saying goodbye. But the first half is so calmly powerful that I can overlook the overly stretched second half.However it seems to me that the most blatant fault of the film is the dialogue, the dialogues are so cheesy. Of course this is an epic film with a lot of stuff to take care off, and Zhang does something better than the others, but there is no excuse for the amateurish dialogue writing.All that being said, I still think it's one of the great movies that Zhang Yimou made, when he was still trying to make great movies - he used to use Chinese culture, instead of exploiting it. It's a little sad to see what he's doing now, whatever the reasons that he's making those craps for.A beautifully crafted film by Zhang Yimou with a great story and an all star cast. Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Zhang Zi Yi and Donnie Yen all performed portrayed their characters in a fine way with style and technique with outstanding stunts and martial arts. Exotic production designs by Tingxiao Huo & Zhenzhou Yi, colorful with dark looking costumes by Emi Wada, beautifully photographed by cinematographer Christopher Doyle, fast & smooth editing by Angie Lam and a relaxing musical score by Tan Dun.The metaphorical use of colors enhances the emotion of each ""chapter"" of the film while telling the audience exactly what the tone of each is as well.Possibly the greatest Kurosawa film not filmed by Kurosawa.

I am not going to say which I prefer, both are masterpieces in their own way. The story is very gripping and diverting. While there are the underlying themes of love, betrayal and loyalty, there is one big theme that is explored very well even if a tad surprising, the defence of totalitarianism against the chaos and insecurities of freedom. As good as Jet Li is, as thoughtful the script is, as haunting the music is, as intriguing the characters are and as fine the direction is, it is the visuals and choreographed sequences that make the film. The cinematography is ravishingly gorgeous and the scenery is stunning with each scene more beautiful and inventive than the one before it, and in terms of effective scenes the highlights in my view are the battles in the rain-drenched chess arena and autumnal forest and the midair sword fight above a crystal lake.

Firstly there's it's use of color. While the first twenty minutes of the film generally look pretty standard, the rest of the film is a complete spectacle, with almost every shot being a work of art. Most scenes challenge the idea that a monochromatic color scheme has to be boring, with each major sequence focusing on using every available shade of the same color to compose some of the most breath taking visuals in cinematic history. On top of it's unique use of color, most major sequences are full of interesting visual themes that never fail to satisfy. (Small ripples in water, hundreds of orange leaves flowing through the air in the same direction, etc.) As for the plot, it takes on an original style I haven't seen many other films attempt. Rather than simply tell a single narrative with a clear direction and plot, the film instead portrays several renditions of the same events, all with wildly different accounts of what happened and why, all providing slight hints at the truth. Where this starts to run into problems is how the film reveals the ""True"". To put it simply, it's complicated, and a lot of important events are explained in what feels like passing lines. On top of all that, most of the fight scenes feel gratuitous, with minimal stakes resting on most of them. And the actual choreography can take some getting used to. Most characters have completely impossible abilities and talents which are never properly explained. The fighters will really just do whatever looks cool in this scene regardless of if the audience knew they could do it,or if they will ever try it again. Finally, the last twenty minutes of the film are just kind of a downer, almost negating all of the positivity you experienced from the sheer eye-candy the rest of the film had. Ultimately, the plot is over complicated, and a lot of the events feel meaningless. This movie is saved by it's unique story structure, and incredible visuals.

Themes this film covers include revenge, ownership, family and territory I suppose.There is a near constant presence of Eastern music in the background, think stringed instruments and drumbeats used in different scenes, depending on the underlying tone of said scene. I felt it was quite engrossing, quite visually pleasing (not least for the amazing numbers of arrows fired at people in some scenes) - I can only imagine CGI must have played a part somehow, as how else could such large numbers be filmed so precisely, I couldn't help but wonder.  There are some lovely landscape shots - the rural Chinese lands looking very picturesque and mythical, not least when, in some scenes, the sun is setting in the background. Of course there is the inevitable element of violence present, although in this film there is surprisingly little (well pretty much no) blood or gore shown at all, with the camera not panning down to show the precise injuries inflicted, instead the persons face is shown and their facial expression often makes it clear whether they've suffered or not. Content wise, there is little in the way of strong language, although there are one or two mild sex scenes but more implied than graphically depicted. Nearly everything seemed gracefully implied rather than laid bare, so to speak. I was quite impressed. For the record, it has a 12 certificate. I suppose it wouldn't be a good idea for young kids to see martial arts and become interested in the violent side of it.Its described as an epic - a (I'm reading from the back of the DVD box here) 'stunning martial arts epic' and I'd agree with that, although it has a relatively short running time of 95 minutes, which would seem rather short for an 'epic' type film. I thought it was quite stunning and engrossing though. If I were to criticise it, I think it would be in terms of the plot being, if anything, perhaps a little too mystical and unclear. Then of course there's the issue of it being originally in Chinese, although you can select to play it in English but obviously that means that its dubbed and I did feel this was a little distracting, in terms of it not being fully synced with the characters on screen but thats to be expected of any originally foreign language film thats dubbed in to English. I just felt that some people may find themselves mildly distracted by the speech being slightly out of sync.As regards the cast, the main cast member, who people may be aware of, is Jet Li. He plays the nameless person effortlessly. Other cast members include Tony Chiu Wai Leung, Maggie Cheung, Ziyi Zhang and Daoming Chen. I'm not sure if there's anything specific I can say about their performances, other than that they all seemed very good to me.Yes I'd recommend this film if your interested in the more mythical side of Chinese, or asian in general, martial arts, without liking there being any extreme (graphic or explicit) violence present. I liked the use of music and felt it was quite engrossing. Having said that, it isn't entirely perfect but overall I thought it was a good film, so I'll recommend it on that basis.… Expand            "

功夫,kung-fu-hustle,,2005,2005," After rewatching the entire Ip Man series which had a grounded style of fighting, I've thought about a martial movie that was the opposite of that. I haven't watched this movie in ages but I remember it for being the most ridiculous movieAfter rewatching the entire Ip Man series which had a grounded style of fighting, I've thought about a martial movie that was the opposite of that. I haven't watched this movie in ages but I remember it for being the most ridiculous movie ever. I decided to rewatch ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and it is still as grand and ridiculous as ever.When the hapless Sing (Stephen Chow) and his dim-witted pal, Bone (Feng Xiaogang), try to scam the residents of Pig Sty Alley into thinking they're members of the dreaded Axe Gang, the real gangsters descend on this Shanghai slum to restore their fearsome reputation. What gang leader Brother Sum (Chan Kwok-Kwan) doesn't know is that this neighbourhood doesn't take kindly to interlopers. Let's start with what makes this movie stand out from other movies, the comedy. This movie has very dark humour, for example, the axe gang leader kills two people with a knife and shotgun and then the next scene goes to them all dancing to a cool score by Raymond Wong. You're never really sure if you are meant to laugh or it is genuinely seriously but director Stephen Chow intertwine both together to create some weird humour but it just works. Another part of the charm of the unique comedy is this movie is the surprisingly over the top slapstick, Looney tunes comedy. The director employs this by using very cartooney sound effects and having guys get hit around like toy ragdolls that result in some laugh out moments. There is a chase scene that feels like it is from Bugs Bunny. I don't want to spoil any of the moments if you haven't watched it but it's as crazy as it sounds and it's awesome. This movie isn't just all comedy though and has some amazing fight/action scenes.  The director uses a lot of wirework and surprisingly a lot of CGI which is quite unprecedented in a martial art or even a comedy movie but it is used very effectively. The fight scenes are well directed and edited but best of all incredibly exciting and thrilling to watch. Despite all the wirework and CGI, every fight is completely visible with no over edits or shaky cam and in 2004 that was quite rare in action movies.The movie was undoubtedly inspired by many American movies such as The Matrix, Spiderman and even The Shining. The director incorporates these very blatant references in the movie to the point that it seems like it is copying but yet it feels unique due to how the director utilises it. All the actors in this movie are great including the director, Stephen Chow, who plays the main lead. Every actor including supporting actors embody the ridiculous nature and manage to stand apart from each other that even in the short runtime of 98 minutes, the audience can grasp every single character's personality and quirkiness in minutes. The set design is amazing as it represents the 1940's Shanghai and feels vibrant and alive. The costumes are great as they feel believable and manage to capture the personality of some of the characters. The score by Raymond Wong is incredible and captures the nature of the movie with one of the stand out being the Axe Gang music which will make you want to dance with it. If there had to be a flaw in the movie then it has to be the lack of a coherent plot. The synopsis is the basic premise for the beginning of the movie but a lot of other different plot points happen to intertwine with this about other characters and then there is this other new plot happening in the third act which makes it feel incoherent. Another flaw would be the lack or very rushed character development which is in part due to its short runtime. Characters can completely change in personality in a matter of minutes without any real build-up towards it.Bill Murray described this movie as ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"" and honestly that is a fair assessment. I feel like there will never be another movie like this ever. The movie blends kung fu, CGI and cartooney humour to create what I consider is one of the most hilarious movies ever made. If you haven't watched it then I HIGHLY recommend you give this movie a watch!… Expand            "

A recent film I watched was entitled Kung Fu Hustle directed by Stephen Chow. One of the reasons I enjoyed this movie is the humour and the way it sends a message that there are serious problems of society in our time. One part of the movie I particularly enjoyed is the way it uses music and sounds to give a better meaning to the movie. At some moments the music was able to give the meaning of humor, but it was also able to give moments wherein we must be serious. With the music it also makes us want to think - what is the meaning of this scene. The elements incorporated gave the meaning of importance.The kungfu hustle movie focuses on satire, a way to criticize something through humor and irony. As the movie goes on it focuses on martial artists, gangs and normal people. This shows that there are levels in society wherein one is stronger than the other. The main character a seemingly weak person wants to join the axe gang, but is instead rejected, and used to get their end goals. But after a while he betrays the enemy and joins the good guys and then beats the enemy. This shows that people in the low society are always used and are rejected, but even if they are down in society they are able to rise up and become better, stronger than the ones who think they’re on top. Overall the way it sends a message and how nice the movie was, I’d give it a 8/10.… Expand            "

Its insistence on empowering the weak, often making superhuman characters out of stereotypes like housewives or browbeaten husbands, is probably its best strength. Its sense of style, of constantly mingling cool (magical guitars, dropkicking mafia badguys through walls, classical or compelling music, etc.) with the deliberately uncool (old lady in hair curlers, assassin in his underwear, etc.) is something to behold.

It has the perfect mix of style, action, humour and parody. Most if not all of the acting is top-notch, however i did wish the characters had more development. The fight scenes are fantastic - amazing choreography, beautifully directed and are so entertaining, humorous and even suspenseful at times, although a lot of the CGI did bother me. My biggest flaw with Kung Fu Hustle however would be that some of the jokes fall flat, or are ruined by CGI. There is also a scene where you suddenly realize who a certain character is, and it's a powerful moment - until it then ruins itself by using an unnecessary flashback to explain who that character is. Apart from those few flaws i really enjoyed Kung Fu Hustle with its beautiful direction, amazing choreography and its style, its charm, the humour and the action, and i'm going to give it a 7/10.

The last 60 minutes offer adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of theWhen it comes to the final hour, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, delivers the goods. The last 60 minutes offer adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Unfortunately, that doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production. During the course of nearly two hours of exposition and setup, there's little in the way of charm or action. There are memorable moments, to be sure, but the overwhelming sense is that the film is desperately spinning its wheels trying to shock and awe with unexpected plot developments.As an end to a trilogy, At World's End does its job, although with less flair and economy than one might hope. It resolves myriad subplots and gets the surviving characters to places where their stories can end or go on, as future sequels demand. Like the other two entries in the series, it's too long and needlessly convoluted. The movie is also more ponderous than the previous Pirates. The defining quality of Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest was a sense of breezy fun. This movie lacks the same feel. Perhaps it’s the weight of expectations and the need to top what went before. The thrilling final hour is almost enough to make one forget how much of a labor it is to trudge through the first two-thirds - almost, but not quite.At World's End doesn't blend the humor and the derring-do as well as its predecessors. For the most part, the jokes are lazier and Cap'n Jack has lost some of his zing. Maybe it has something to do with his being killed at the end of the last movie. Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is more restrained; the intimidation factor is gone. Maybe it has something to do with his being resurrected at the end of the last movie. The on-again/off-again love affair between Will and Elizabeth is on again (following her brief dalliance with Jack) and, while sparks don't fly, at least both characters evidence more pizzazz this time 'round. Meanwhile, Cap'n Jack finds his screen time leeched away to others. A late entrance and too may extraneous side-stories take the focus off our swishy hero, and that's not a good thing.As far as the bad guys are concerned, they're not an intimidating bunch. Without his Kraken, Davy Jones is just another fishy looking CGI creature. As Cutler Beckett, Tom Hollander does a good job being nasty, but one never gets the impression that he'll be able to get the better of Jack. Defining other villains could be misleading since numerous characters changes sides, some more than once. At times, a scorecard is needed to figure who's on which team at any given time.The need to make longer, more busy second sequels is an undesirable trend. By throwing so much into the mix, the filmmakers - including director Gore Verbinski, who has helmed all three pirate yarns - risk losing what attracted viewers in the first place. The initial Pirates was an unexpected hit. The need to do things bigger and more spectacular led to fissures in Dead Man's Chest. Those fissures have widened and deepened in At World's End.Most Pirates aficionados won't complain (at least not too much). This is a chance to re-visit old friends and see where some of their stories end. It's a chance to sail with Cap'n Jack from death to life and meet his dad (played, as has been reported everywhere, by Keith Richards). The movie does enough things right that it won't leave scores of despondent fans in its wake. Unfortunately, it does enough things wrong to keep me from giving it a wholehearted recommendation. It could have been better, but it also could have been worse.… Expand            "

More Cap'n Jack Sparrow, what more could you want I ask. Critics are expecting this and that and then when they don't get exactly what they wanted they pull out a totally negative feedback to one of the best movies of the year, other examples to that claim would be Spider-Man 3, Shrek 3.

That said, though, I had fun watching At World's End, just like I had fun watching the last 2 Pirates movies. At World's End is almost impossible to follow, it's extremely long, it lacks a strong, memorable new villain (they're just going after the humans?

No one really cares about the Pirates's intriguing and original story line. Overall, for the first 2 hrs and 15 mins, this movie was just as good as the original Pirates movie. All the cleverness, character plots, and humor were all done to perfection with no trace of cheesiness anywhere! I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jack Sparrow was just as funny in this film as the first, because in the second he failed to make me laugh once.

For it's length it doesn't really tell anything, and what it does it's unnecessarily confusing. The sfx are over the top, bordering on ridiculous. You don't build any affection to any of the characters. Sure, the film has it's moments, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile spending your cash on. Don't get me wrong, I'm perfectly aware what to expect from a summer blockbuster and what not. But Pirates 3 is just one big mess.

That's the ""strategy"" employed by such suicidal sequels as Speed 2: Cruise Control (in which Keanu Reeves is nowhere to be found, Sandra Bullock's character devolves from lovably quirky to intensely irritating, and the villain was once again an employee who was genuinely cheated by his bosses, making both Speed movies perfect porno for Al Dunlap and Jack Welch). So why are Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski and writers Terry Elliott and Ted Russio stealing from the Speed 2 playbook? Do they really believe in their collective heart of hearts that what the millions and millions of moviegoers who made POTC1 a surprise smash in 2003 and POTC2 last year's Number One box office hit really wanted was an even longer and more bloated pseudo-epic with more enervatingly Byzantine plotting, lots and LOTS more talk, far less action...and MUCH less Johnny Depp?!? (At one point in POTC3, one of Captain Jack Sparrow's foes asks if Sparrow actually plans his actions--or just makes them up as he goes along. Is the Bruckheimer crew making an arrogant in-joke about themselves?) I'm tired of hearing about how two of this year's best and most original films, David Fincher's Zodiac and Robert Rodriguez/ Quentin Tarantino's Grindhouse, would've been better (and made more money) if their makers had tamed their personal indulgences and trimmed their work a bit when it's bloody obvious that Bruckheimer, Verbinski and gang are 2007's true purveyors of arrogant egomania. How else would you explain their presumptiousness in not only NOT bringing Sparrow back for a full half-hour and then, when doing so, explaining his survival from the teeth and tentacles of POTC2's truly spectacular sea monster, the Kraken (who isn't even seen onscreen here) in a manner that's extremely sloppy and haphazaed by any standards but especially so in a beloved franchise that so many enthusiastic moviegoers have emotionally invested themselves in? Even allowing for the supernatural elements tossed into the mix, to buy into Sparrow's reunion with the rest of the principals, you have to disavow any common-sense knowledge of geography, zoology, weather or just plain elementary school logic. (I recently watched a silly Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movie, Tarzan's Desert Mystery, in which the Lord of the Apes ftravels on horseback from a desert climate to a jungle one in about 30 seconds of real time. That 1943 ""B"" movie's stupidity is at least excused by the fact that it WAS a low-budget programmer. Over half a century and with innumerable times the money involved, there is simply no excuse for the Pirates people to harbor such cavalier disregard for its storytelling OR its audience.) For everything that POTC3 gets right--the production design is, once again, wonderfully detailed, eye-filling and even whimsical; the story arc concerning my favorite supporting character, the unexpectedly complex and conflicted Norrington (Jack Davenport) reaches a fitting if bittersweet end, and the monkey IS irresistable--it gets three times as much wrong, nothing so much as a pirates' council that grinds the movie midway into an even deader halt. (I've been at homeowners' association meetings that were far livelier and more rich in genuine entertainment value, even WITHOUT surprise guest appearances by legendary rock gods.) Not much less miscalculated are the moviemakers' gratuitous and unnecessary stabs, so to speak, at social commentary involving Guatanamo Bay and the USA Patriot Act, culminating in the (implied) hanging of a young boy that makes this movie truly inappropriate for children, even with its PG-13 rating. (It IS notable from a historical and cultural context that the British Navy is depicted in this aggressively mainstream movie with the same attitude with which the U.S. Cavalry was treated in such revisionist, Vietnam-era westerns as Soldier Blue and Little Big Man.) Even the wildly elaborate, storm-swept climactic sea battle doesn't have a patch on the funny, Indiana Jones-esque bits, such as the three man water-wheel swordfight and the shish-kabob drop, that punctuated the otherwise uneven POTC2. But hey, by the time we're edging toward Hour Three (which seems like Hour Five), at least the big finale is highly welcome (to say nothing of highly overdue)...especially when it caps off a movie that forces its audience to walk a seemingly neverending plank.… Expand            "

The music, however, was great as always. -There was so much potential in this movie: at first I thought it would be about pirates being hunted down and having to form one last alliance to stand up against the British Armada (like the trailers promised).

Nope: they didn't show any of the other pirates lords against the British Armada during the final fight, which would have just been stunning and what I was most looking forward to from the trailers. -Ah well, wasted potential.

At World's End makes this even more difficult by adding in a few extra story lines for good measure. The result is a jumbled film that tackles far too much, even with a particularly long running time. Because of the focus on tying up the loose ends of the story, not nearly enough time is dedicated to characters and important events. The main quest (to rescue Jack) is done and dusted in less than an hour and undermines the impact of the cliffhanger ending of DMC. Norrington, Chow Yun-Fat's Sao Feng and even the Kraken are all pushed to the side and play minor roles. This is disappointing as Norrington and the Kraken were of much greater importance to proceedings in DMC and Sao Feng was an interesting new edition. More troubling is the chance in the character of Will Turner who begins the movie as a sneering, almost villainous character but n the end returns to his usual self. This strange shift is clearly done for the benefit of the story but prompts the audience to dislike Will, a usually likable and morally upright character. The action scenes, though entertaining, drag on and quickly outstay their welcome.

While still not capturing or even replicating the original, but it is mountains better than the Dead Man's Chest, and while you can't really miss a single minute for fear completely losing your place in this often puzzling and densely populated film, it is still very long, much longer than it should have been.There is a lot to keep up with but after the climax of the original film, a crew sets out to rescue Jack from Davy Jones Locker, a place of nothing, to be punished, as expanded cast member Tia Dalma (Naomi Harris) outlines. But also afoot is the attempt to call the Brethren court, a pirate organisation made of all pirate lords to bring about the end of the East India Trading Company's rain of terror across the seas, led by their new pet Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), whose heart is owned by said company, hence his actions.Captain Jack, meanwhile, mentally rots away as he wonders exactly where he is and if the things going on around him are truly real, his comical and whimsical attitude is again excellently performed through Johnny Depp, his character has indeed stood the test of the three films, and he is the most enjoyable thing to look forward to in this.With that thought, there is again a lot of pointless and time-consuming elements of the film that contribute little to the cause, and with the continuing mutiny and rebellious nature of both Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner make it difficult give any sort of sympathy towards them. Their heightening love story within the film is distracting and too much emphasis is placed upon it, deterring from the more enjoyable aspects.It is Jack and the returning Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa that truly maintain the flashes of greatness from the original, Jack and his long conversations with himself, or Barbosa and his typical pirate nature, mix that in with a plot that although complex, does give the incentive to watch over again.As visuals go, this is a true spectacle in front of you, beautiful, marvellous and a delight to the eyes, the final battle in particular is breathtaking, ships, pirates and storms galore. Effects an marvels don't get much bigger than this, combined with an impressive score.Not as captivating as the original, quite lengthy with many unnecessary moments and the same goes for characters, but certainly better than the second with an impressive finale, epic set pieces characters staying true to their roots and continuing powerful performances from Depp, Rush and Nighy, oh and a cameo from a particular Rolling Stone, make this quite a worthwhile and explosive third showing.… Expand            "

It suffers from all the problems of the first and second, and then some. Much of the appeal of the first two are gone, and what remains is a confusing, boring, and unfunny second sequel. Problems abound from everywhere, so I'll be working hard to narrow it down. For one, Johnny Depp's role as Jack Sparrow is once again shrunken into a smaller part. Also there is absolutely no action that is even vaguely interesting (after the first half hour). In fact, the last hour is at least 45 minutes action, and it's surprisingly dull. In fact, it's tedious. It's just people killing each other, and nothing interesting about it. There's no variety, no interesting atmosphere. Just swords clashing. There is a plot, which is more than what can be said for the second, but it's so confusing, with so many characters and sub plots and deceptions and people changing sides, that it's almost completely incomprehensible. Most of the characters are obnoxious, and though that was apparent in the first two, it is even more so now. There are too many flat gags, too many boring scenes, and too many characters for the film to flow well. There were times when I wondered what the purpose was for really anything going on during the movie. There are some good things though. The first half hour is strong, just like the first two flicks, but after that, the movie is drop dead boring. The score is another winner from composer Hanz Zimmer, albeit a tad familiar. The acting is dependable, and even admist a thousand bad jokes, there's at least a few laughs (or chuckles really). There is one bizzare scene where godess of the sea, Calypso is turned back into her original form. This scene is so weird, stupid, and nonsensical, it's hard not to burst out laughing (I most certainly did). Let's just say that she grows about 1,000 feet high, talks like she has really bad congestion, looks like she's constipated, and eventually explodes into a million crabs. It's even more ridiculous on screen.

It can make for a rough watch at times because the moments where the film is actually good is too few and in-between.It takes a little over 40 minutes to be introduced to Jack again and Davy Jones is painfully absent in the first 2/3 of the film. Considering Depp is the star and Jones is the built-up main villain, maybe introduced them both earlier? You can do that by editing down that overly long introduction for starters. You could also edit down parts with Sao Feng and his crew considering they have pretty much no relevance to the film past the halfway mark. I think trimming the run time at least 25-30 minutes, which is incredibly manageable, would have fixed most of the pacing issues and make it so it doesn't seem like we go a bulk of the runtime without seeing the stars of the film.All in all, At World's End isn't bad but it is disappointing.

The ""good free Rebel Pirates VS Evil EIC Empire"" being a particularly jarring one as pirates were never supposed to be heroes of justice, nor was the Navy the Stormtroopers or Beckett Darth Vader...The acting never made me roll my eyes, except maybe get a little stupid when Orlando Bloom tries to act like he's in love, and the musical score and general cinematography is certainly interesting, but that does not justify the very poor pacing and seriously flawed plots of this movie.Honestly if it had been me doing it, At World's End would've been rescuing Jack Sparrow only, which I would've stretched from 1h10 minutes to 2h10 minutes with more action and a more varied story, and a double cliffhanger at the end that William wants to save his dad and that the EIC wants to truly take over the world, Star Wars Empire style.

To clarify: There were some cases where you hear the argument that it would be impossible to fit the material in one movie or one final book like for example Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows for movies or the conclusion to Eragon in books. This is mostly wrong and an attempt to get more money out of customers. Here it is a case were it would have been the truth and beneficial. This does not mean this movie is bad. It means it has so much arcs that you struggle to follow everything that happens and it becomes tiresome after a while. It has also a few weaknesses that I will mention later. The story continues after the events of Dead Mans Chest and I think I give you just the set up what the characters motivations are at the beginning to show you how much arcs are fit into this movie: William Turner, Elisabeth Swan and Hector Barbossa want to save Jack Sparrow and stop Cutler Beckett and Davy Jones. William wants to safe his father and Elisabeth. Hector wants to his life back, the pirates safety and get the Black Pearl. Elisabeth wants to save William and her father while she has to care for her crew. Jack wants the Black Pearl and to be safe from Davy Jones and Cutler Becket. Davy Jones wants his revenge, his freedom and possibly salvation. Cutler Becket wants to rule the sea, exterminate all pirates and more power. Tia Dalma wants also her salvation and revenge. The pirates want to continue their lifestyle and Cutler Beckett / Davy Jones gone. James Norrigton now Admiral sees what price he has paid and seeks a way out. Governor Weatherby tries his best to keep his daughter safe while waiting for a chance to oppose Cutler Beckett. This is just the set up and I am not sure if I even have forgotten some stuff. The story is overburdened and it will be no pleasure to keep track of all developments / arcs. It is a shame because most of the story works well and it has great moments. There are a few missteps like wasting Chow Yun-Fat. It was a colossal disappointment as we expected more and they gave the impression he was more prominent in the story. Then there is the conclusion for William and Elisabeth. It did not feel good and was another disappointment (Watch Dead Men Tell no Tales / Part 5 for a continuation of the arc). If it were 2 movies they could have used more time for better impact and development of the story and characters. The actors deliver a good performance overall.  I see no missteps here but they cant save the movie or better said increase my rating. Again the sets, costumes and special effects are well done. The fight scenes deliver and are intense. The climax is a roller-coaster ride that is memorable. The soundtrack is as to be expected by Hans Zimmer brilliant. I cant praise him enough and Hoist the Colours which is one of my favorite movie tracks and a collaboration with Gore Verbinski.

At World's End is certainly not a terrible film, far from it, I just found it rather disappointing that's all, plot-wise being the least remarkable of the three films. I will say there is a lot to recommend it, namely the art direction, and the special effects weren't too bad either. The cinematography was impressive, there is some lovely period detail and I thought there were some very well staged battle sequences. The music by Hans Zimmer, one of my favourite film composers, was outstanding, very rousing and dramatic. And the performances weren't so bad either- Jack Sparrow is still the lovable rogue we have come to know and love, and Johnny Depp played him marvellously. A very talented actor, Geoffrey Rush, sinks his teeth into the part of Captain Barbosa, I particularly loved the line, ""I'm a bit busy at the moment."" And Bill Nighy was delightfully villainous as Davy Jones. However, the film does have flaws that prevents it from being the rollicking film it had the potential of being. The plot did take a while to get going, and sometimes became unfocused and convoluted, like Elizabeth and Will declaring their wedding vows in the middle of a big fight. Also there are a lot of characters, and one or two of them served no real purpose to the plot, and a lot was crammed into the long running time, so at the end of the day, it felt a bit bloated. The script was full of existing jokes, not necessarily a bad thing, but overall it lacked freshness, and the humour and fun, that made me love the first film so much. Overall, it is certain performances, fantastic music and some well-staged battles that salvage an otherwise bloated and disappointing second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox… Expand            "

A bountiful opening is assured. The running time could diminish this swashbuckler’s staying power, but Disney would likely leap at “Pirates IV” in a heartbeat if the principals would enlist for another tour at sea.In a sense, the two “Pirates” sequels feel less like movies than a shared event — much like a concert where the audience sits patiently through lesser known numbers to hear the band belt out favorite tunes. A similar phenomenon occurs during the arid stretches (and there are several) in this sprawling, messy adventure, to be endured until Johnny Depp does something flamboyantly amusing or a new face like Keith Richards or Chow Yun-fat graces the screen.The notion of “Pirates” as, foremost, a consumer product came through loud and clear in the current Entertainment Weekly, in which director Gore Verbinski referred to the screwy process of shooting the second and much of the third movie simultaneously as “How Not to Make a Film 101.”At one point, when a character asks of Depp’s loopy Capt. Jack Sparrow, “Do you think he plans it out or just makes it up as he goes along?,” it’s hard not to wonder if Verbinski and his writing collaborators, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, aren’t slipping in a sly comment about the film itself.Whatever quaint underpinnings there were to the class-divided romance between Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) have dissipated in the journey since the 2003 original, as their relationship goes through a series of fits, starts and betrayals — all in this movie alone.Picking up where the second left off (though a refresher course wouldn’t hurt), the couple and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) begin in Singapore, where they and their pirate mates hope to liberate Jack from Davy Jones’ Locker, a surreal realm between purgatory and hell. A lengthy battle ensues before the too-long quest to find Jack leads to a colorful international assembly of pirates at Shipwreck City, with the East India Trading Co.’s hissable nobleman Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) in hot pursuit and a final showdown inevitable.That questions of life and death are somewhat fungible here helps mitigate the high level of carnage, which includes a mass hanging sequence at the outset, as Beckett wages a reign of terror in seeking to bring the pirates to heel.For the most part, those big themes and even the fundamental rules are easily obscured by the cacophony of relentless, state-of-the-art special effects and Hans Zimmer’s equally unremitting score, which at times overwhelms the dialogue. Indeed, repetitive action from multiple cannon-firing battles to ship-sucking vortexes yield diminishing returns; the pic’s greatest virtue is its sense of whimsy, whether that involves multiple Depps debating himself or the crew’s slapstick antics, which wring considerable mileage out of that monkey and parrot.Depp’s fey, morally challenged buccaneer remains a kick and the pic’s biggest asset, whereas the now-butt-kicking Elizabeth and conflicted Will — however dreamy — have grown tiresome, especially when saddled with stirring, Errol Flynn-style “Avast, me hearties!” interludes.In musing about the Land of the Dead, Barbossa suggests that getting there isn’t the tough part; “It’s getting back.” Given that producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s crew unlocked the secret to spinning riches out of a theme-park attraction, in this case getting there was no small feat. It’s returning there that has been something of a chore — a course “At World’s End” steadies but can’t entirely reverse.… Expand            "

At World'sGiven it's origins as a theme park ride, it's apt that Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has experienced a trajectory not unlike that of a rollercoaster: an initial high, followed by repeated plummets to nauseating lows. At World's End completes the story begun by last year's Dead Man's Chest, and features all the cacophonous action and paper-thin drama that helped sabotage its deflating predecessor. Aesthetically speaking, there's virtually nothing differentiating these films, as both boast Gore Verbinski's spatially incoherent battle scenes, Dolby-customized sonic bombast, and lavish special effects so lacking in fine detail that they're deliberately shrouded in murky darkness. Yo Ho Ugh, it's merely more of the same, and I do mean more; at a whopping 168 minutes, so much happens in At World's End that it's nigh impossible to keep up with all the various machinations and conflicting motivations crammed into Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script. Such overkill, however, is simply a tool of distraction aimed at diverting attention away from the fact that the film's existence is driven not by overarching narrative demands (there's barely enough substantive material to warrant even a 90-minute runtime), but by an insatiable corporate bottom line.Previously on Pirates: Smash, bang, boom, and other loud, meaningless hijinks led fey rascal Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to be imprisoned in Davy Jones's locker, and insipid lovebirds Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to team up with newly resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to help rescue Jack so he, in turn, could aid their quest to defeat squid-faced Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and his new master, East India Trading Company bigwig Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander). That mouthful of a synopsis pales in comparison to the one necessitated by At World's End, whose myriad convoluted storylines involve most principal characters making promises to their mates, then engineering duplicitous back-room arrangements with their enemies (to further their own selfish ends), and then coming around and doing the right thing in the end because, well, it makes for a happier, safer, less morally complicated ending. Countless cross-purposes are simultaneously at work and yet, throughout, amount to naught, with the resultant plot muddle—made up of thinly sketched characters who are chiefly defined by their relationship to each other, and whose issues are dealt with in bite-size portions to make room for distended combat sequences—stinking like a pile of discarded corpses.The film's primary thread concerns the historic convening of the Brethren Court (made up of the nine pirate lords, two of whom are Sparrow and Barbossa), providing At World's End with an opportunity to indulge in outlandish stereotypes (among them: the screaming Japanese pirate queen, the stuffy French pirate fop, and Chow Yun-Fat sporting a Fu Manchu as Singapore's stilted English-spouting Captain Sao Feng). Crass, to be sure, but no less laughably objectionable than the script's underlying clash between British capitalism (“It's just good business,” is Cutler's be-all excuse for treachery) and pirate “honor,” a concept Verbinski and company don't even bother trying to explain. In essence, we're meant to root for Jack and his plundering cohorts purely because they're the funny and/or hot ones. It's a strategy that might have been more tenable were it not for Bloom's enervating blandness, Knightley's counterfeit badass posturing and Braveheart-ish “Freedom!” speech (as well as her comical ability to keep her tanned face smudge-free), and the unavoidable sense that what was once unique and inspired about Depp's Sparrow has, at this point, become calculated and dull, his prancing and lisping and flailing about emitting the odor of a stale routine.Absent rhythm or even basic narrative uniformity, the film careens clumsily, occasionally hitting upon a quirky moment—such as Jack's hallucinatory escapades in Davy Jones's locker and in the Flying Dutchman's brig—but mainly propping up its watery scenarios with recycled imagery (including three shots of boats bursting out of the ocean), pedestrian swordfights, and a dreary cameo from Keith Richards as the elder Sparrow. From beating aortas and heart-shaped lockets to enchanted compasses and cipher-laden maps, talismanic crap abounds, yet because the film's mythology carries no weight, these trinkets' supposed momentous value is nil; they're just so much costume jewelry. Meanwhile, limp romantic dilemmas are reconciled during a climactic showdown in which two battleships chase each other around a whirlpool in some bizarre (and immensely tedious) version of Pirate NASCAR.At World's End—a spectacle composed of intangible CG, superficial performances, and twists and turns that are vapidly resolved—it's clear that the statement also pertains to this empty vessel of a Hollywood blockbuster franchise.… Expand            "

When presented with a treasury report, Groucho's Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed President of Freedonia, declares it so simple that even a 4-year-old child could understand it. ""Now run out and find me a 4-year-old child,"" he says. ""I can't make head or tail of it."" As a consequence of trying to turn a theme-park ride into a 463-minute trilogy, the Pirates movies are freighted by so much convoluted mythology and supernatural hoo-hah that perhaps only the very young can understand their dream logic. The last, longest, and most tedious of the bunch, At World's End sags under reams of exposition that not only fail to clarify the story, but take away from the slapstick tomfoolery that made the first film (and a couple of sequences in the second) escapist fun.Picking up where the second entry, Dead Man's Chest, left off, the new film finds bland heroes Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley teaming up with the once-dastardly Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to find Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, who's trapped in Davy Jones' locker. Here's where things get confusing: Bloom and the gang must first go through Singapore to get a special navigational map from Chinese pirate Chow Yun-Fat, who's one of several pirate lords who must unite in order to secure pirate freedom in the Seven Seas. (There's also some business about a ""Brethren Of The Coast,"" and the ""nine pieces of eight,"" but let's not get ahead of ourselves.) Meanwhile, the East India Trading Company has possession of Davy Jones' beating heart and has brought Jones and his Flying Dutchman ship into its quest to eradicate pirate-kind. And then there's Sparrow, whose predicament has left him with several metaphysical manifestations.The Pirates Of The Caribbean trilogy—and At World's End especially—stands as a lesson in the perils in blockbuster filmmaking: What started out as a fleet one-off swashbuckler with novel supernatural elements has become loaded and graceless, with each new entry barreling across the goal line like William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry. The franchise's two chief assets—the surprise of Depp's swishy pirate and Gore Verbinski's dexterity at directing slapstick action sequences—have been eclipsed by expository scenes that confuse even more deeply in their attempt to clear things up.

The pirates, led by Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), will have to travel to the other side of the world in order to seek an unlikely alliance to stop the ambitious Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who wants to use Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) to dominate the seas. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.The release of this film was expected given the previous film need a conclusion. However, the film didn't bring anything surprising, nor could surprise a lot. The differentiating factor of the previous film was, clearly, how the central characters have changed throughout the film and the way the plot takes advantage of that to become more complex and interesting. In this case we have the closing of a cycle, not its development. Perhaps the biggest surprises are the return of Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush), this time in the ""good side"", the unexpected importance that Naomie Harris's character will have at the end and the conclusion, a bit disappointing, of the love story between Will and Elizabeth. The moments of humor remained the main dish of Jhonnie Depp, but the film also has a certain dramatic tension than the previous two had not. At least not so as present and ravishing.This film was designed to end the most popular pirate's saga that cinema has ever seen, but the demands of the film industry, eager to make more money with the public's wishes, will give rise to a fourth film. Dramatic, tense, interesting but far from being surprising or inventive, this movie deserves congratulations by the way that, supposedly, would have ended to that story.… Expand            "

Against the backdrop of theStop the fire, we board! Dual graphics, overworked actors, one budget for two films. 2006 and 2007, respectively, was famous for the fact that two parts of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" came out at once. Against the backdrop of the popularity of the franchise, it was decided that in the aforementioned years several parts of the pirate theme will come out. 450 million dollars in order to shoot two quality pictures - the task is not from the lungs, right? Nowadays, this practice is often used, but in those days it was a rarity. The test of the pen - this is how you can call what Disney started. Gore Verbinsky, for whom ""At World's End"" was the final part in the series, tried to finish his five-year epic with the series that he loved the most. Having an impressive budget, Gore created the longest pirate picture in history. Thank you? Or ""Well, why?"". What do you want to say after watching ""At World's End"" ?. Of course, thanks! Captain Jack Sparrow left the world of the living. King of England, not intending to tolerate pirate society any more, and issued a decree on immediate capture and their death. A pirate company stands on the brink of destruction. Returned from the other world Captain Barbossa intends to convene the Council of the Brotherhood in order to avoid the complete disappearance of piracy in the world. But the council can not be convened without all nine barons. Jack Sparrow, who is one of them, must return to the realm of the living. Longtime friends of Jack, Elizabeth and William, also decide to help Hector in this not an easy matter. But is it worth it for pure intent? Does Barbossa really want the true return of the Sparrow, because it's so desirable, and Elizabeth and William missed their departed friend? The question is controversial, as is the adequacy of the Sparrow.""At World's End"" is the first film in which all nine pirate barons gather. The third part slowly but surely moved along the realities of our world - the intelligentsia got tired of living with those who allegedly poison their world. Everyone who has ever made contact with a pirated society is subject to hanging. And even the ""Flying Dutchman"", led by Captain Jones, a man who can be killed in only one way - to cut his heart, is forced to cooperate with the royal henchmen. A powerful century of piracy, striking people, both horror and joy, comes to an end.Captain Jack Sparrow, whose personality had seen many adventures, is imprisoned in the cache of Davy Jones. Left alone with his beloved (""Black Pearl""), Jack tries in every way not to go insane. At the same time, the King began the century of extermination of pirates. After seeing epic and popkornovye scenes, Gore Verbinski (the director of the last part for him) continued to delight the audience with a quality action. The picture still looks delicious, and the actions of the characters are amusing, although sometimes they are cliched. Captain Sparrow, whose film character in the film develops in a characteristic way, again evolves. If in the last two parts Jack was formed from a ""nihilist"" to a man who is somehow important to others, then in the third part, Jack turns into a real person who is important to the lives of others.And even past enemies who are hungry for the death of their enemies are not the most important thing in the film. The present enemies of the Sparrow are their own thoughts. The desire for immortality, the opportunity to ""recoup"" for past affairs with Jones - all this is so distracting to Jack that he is not able to think this day and rationally make the right decisions (however, as always). And the long-standing rivalry with Barbossa is a more friendly truce than enemy intent. It is worth remembering that the third part in the franchise is all the same part of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The picture is still pleasantly entertaining, every banal and tupic moment, which you do not want to pay attention to, you miss. Comic Johnny Depp continues to delight in its abundance of jolly and pleasant jokes, while the other characters, both main and secondary, continue to confirm their acting skills. Jeffrey Rush is still serious and stern, Kevin McNally is a trusting nedotepa, and Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook - are as much a sparrow as they are. The only thing that is not particularly pleasing is the lack of a full-fledged and painted antagonist. Attempts to make such Davy Jones were justified in the second part, but faded in the sequel. Verdict. Considering how weak the fourth part left - the departure of Hora Verbinski had its drop in the sea. The formula, thanks to which the last two parts of the pirates were successful - has operated up to now. However, the fact that the franchise needed changes was visible to the naked eye. But Verbinsky's departure from the post of director of the pirate saga - too bad decision, because of which the next part is very badly damaged.… Expand            "

Condemned prisoners sing ""Hoist the Colours"" to compel the nine Pirate Lords to convene at Shipwreck Cove to hold the Brethren Court. Because Captain Jack Sparrow, Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea, never named a successor before being dragged to Davy Jones' Locker, Captain Barbossa, Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Tia Dalma, and the crew of the Black Pearl plot to rescue Jack. Traveling to Singapore, the crew meet Captain Sao Feng (Pirate Lord of the South China Sea), who owns navigational charts to the Locker. Beckett's soldiers invade, but the crew escape. Will secretly promises to give Jack to Feng in return for the Pearl, which he will use to rescue his father Bootstrap Bill Turner from the Flying Dutchman.The crew travels to the Locker, rescuing Jack and recovering the Black Pearl. The crew encounters many dead souls, including Elizabeth's father Governor Swann, who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that whoever kills Jones, by stabbing his disembodied heart, must take his place as the Dutchman's captain.Returning to the living world, the Pearl stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the Kraken lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett. They are then attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. Through a complex series of deals, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is the goddess Calypso, while the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the Pearl. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of the plan to seize control of the Dutchman. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones. He plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Davy Jones attacks Feng's ship, the Empress, mortally wounding Feng in the process. Feng appoints Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the Dutchman, where she finds Bootstrap Bill losing himself to the Dutchman's curse. In a moment of clarity he tells her that Will must not come, since by killing Jones he will bind himself to the ship. Admiral Norrington frees Elizabeth and her new crew from the Dutchman, but is killed by Bootstrap Bill.The Black Pearl arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the Pearl's brig, revealing she is Calypso. Jack's father Captain Teague, Keeper of the Pirate Code, informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can decide on going into battle. A vote is taken. To avoid a stalemate, Jack casts his vote for Elizabeth, making her King.The Brethren Court and Beckett's fleets emerge for war. On a sandbank, Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa, Beckett, Jones, and Will parley, trading Will for Jack. Barbossa steals Jack's piece of eight, all of which are owned by the Pirate Lords and required to free Calypso. Barbossa frees Calypso, but when Will reveals it was Jones who betrayed her and made it possible for the first Court to imprison her, Calypso vanishes and summons an enormous maelstrom.The Pearl and the Dutchman battle in the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa. On board the Dutchman, Jones and Jack engage in a duel for control of Davy Jones' heart. Jones stabs Will, mortally wounding him. Jack gives up his chance for immortality and instead helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones, whose body falls into the maelstrom. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman as it is sucked into the maelstrom.As Beckett's ship, the Endeavour, approaches to destroy the Pearl, the Dutchman rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the Endeavour. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island. Will departs on the Dutchman, leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart.Jack and Joshamee Gibbs discover Barbossa has stolen the Black Pearl again, but Jack planned ahead and stole Sao Feng's navigational charts.

And Cronenberg's makes you realize how many movie fights are flops -- and how really hard it is to kill or immobilize a human being with your arms, legs, feet and hands. Literally and figuratively, ""Eastern Promises"" has guts. And in this sense, it reminds me of both the excruciatingly protracted struggle between Paul Newman and the Russian agent in ""Torn Curtain,"" and the knock-down, drag-out fist-fest between Keith David and Rowdy Roddy Piper in John Carpenter's ""They Live! Directed in a bold, graphic style similar to that of his previous film, ""A History of Violence,"" ""Eastern Promises"" is shockingly gorgeous, for all the ugliness it portrays. The film is set in London, and the colors are dark and heavy: gray skies, slick black streets, brandy, absinthe, venous blood. A hospital midwife (Naomi Watts) finds a patient's diary that gets her involved with Russian gangsters -- in particular, a shrewd and ambitious chauffeur played by ""History of Violence"" star Viggo Mortensen. It begins like a Cronenbergian horror movie, and becomes... a Cronenberg gangster movie -- an elemental struggle between good and evil, life and death, east and west, blood and money, trust and betrayal, commerce and morality, mind and body. Remember, that's ""elemental,"" not ""simplistic."" There are... complications.… Expand            "

If there is one thing Cronenburg is so good at, its taking a movie beyond the limits of being just a movie. It is more a study of the human being, and their behaviors and nature, and how they act and who they are, and who they pretend to be. This movie takes you into the lives of the Russian mob, a very dark, disturbing place to be, and a family of a young woman (played by Naomi Watts), her uncle and aunt find themselves thrown into the chaos. They discover a diary of a young prostitute, and this diary has a lot of power in this movie. Muehller-Stahl, who plays the leader of the vory V Zakone brotherhood, is absolutely terrific, and can shoot one glance that could freeze you, and then cut you to pieces. He is menacing, not in his actions, but in his look alone. Also, Viggo Mortensen delivers the performance of his life, playing this mysterious, off-put, odd friend of the son of the brotherhood leader. He can exude both evil, and kindness in just a few different shots. The action in the movie is real, and it is haunting, and one scene in particular will most likely stick with you in your head for quite some time. This is a movie to be taken seriously, and deep, deep under its seemingly simple layers of story, lies a very interesting tale that leads through the cobwebs of the Russian mob, and just what happens when family is messed with. This is a very good piece on humanity, and it is something not to be missed at a time when all Hollywood can chock up are lame Dane Cook films and same-old same-old ""kill the zombie"" movies.… Expand            "

For someone who grew up watching the cartoon, the movie was a dream come true, and I also believe Michael Bay(the director) put a lot of us to shame by delivering a worthy product ... but I digress. My intention is to share thoughts on movies I love like the one I just saw, and ones I truly loathe and would gladly request for $9 back...case in point - ""The Reaping"" ""Eastern Promises"" is movie directed by David Cronenberg. You may remember him from ""A History of Violence"". Every one remembers that movie...Seeing Maria Bello in her cheer leader outfit alone was worth the price of admission... then there was the sex scene on the steps. I suggest you rent or purchase it immediately. Back to ""Eastern Promises""...The main actors are Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Vincent Cassel and Armin Mueller-Stahl; I'll get to information about their performances soon enough. Without giving much away, the story is basically about a nurse who unfortunately witnesses a 14 year old Russian girl giving birth and dying during labor. She embarks on a quest to find out more about the girl's family and also have her diary translated. On the nurse's quest of discovery, she ends up getting involved with some really vile people, mainly the Russian crime family - Vory V Zakone. The rest of the movie unravels the mystery behind the dead girl, and eventually the father of the baby.Warning! If you are not a fan of violent movies, you will not enjoy this movie. There's enough extreme violence to make the toughest guy squirm. One scene in the steam room is particularly disturbing to watch. I was impressed by all the actors. Naomi Watts, who I last saw playing the love interest of a mega-sized gorilla, put on quite a performance. Her character is the nurse who drove the story, but this is not a role she'll be remembered for...Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the owner of a restaurant and is also affiliated with the Vory V Zakone. Vincent Cassel plays his crazy son Kirill, who much to his father's chagrin, is also rumored to be gay. The true star of the movie is Viggo, who plays Nikolai, a mysterious driver who definitely wants to move up in the family. His russian is fluent, and his accent is perfect. It's almost hard to imagine him speaking in another accent after this movie. He accent and grammar really did sound like his spoke a Slavic language natively. It was very interesting to watch him play his role so flawlessly. In all, this was a pretty good movie. I believe David Cronenberg and Viggo should make more movies together. They certainly have a formula that works.… Expand            "

However, I don't get the feeling this is the type of movie that will stay with me for a long time. Unlike A History of Violence, which aims and reaches higher via its themes (eg. dark family secrets, can we escape our past?, etc.) Eastern Promises is very narrow in its focus.

In particular, the dead Russian girl's voice over was terribly executed; it was excruciatingly cloying in its melodrama.

I thought the movie ended rather abruptly, too, especially since a plot twist is introduced right at the end. I expected the movie to go another twenty minutes. (Although the final shot is haunting.) And I didn't think Mortensen or Watts had any chemistry warranting a kiss. That said, Mortensen is great, very laconic, using understatement to maximum effect. The violence is graphic, but, excepting the spectacular bath scene, it comes across as more gratuitous than shocking or unnerving. This is not the edgy, intense film I was anticipating, but more or a half-realized, noble failure that still merits a viewing.… Expand            "

Naomi Watts would have been the ideal woman for Alfred Hitchcock. She plays a British nurse looking the family of dead Russian girl amid the mob, and there's something less-than-classic about her face and modern about her independence. She's like this perfectly woven garment of emotional temperatures -- hot and cold all the time. The hot part has never come naturally to Nicole Kidman, who's got the mechanics of Grace Kelly, Janet Leigh, and Tippi Hedren (chilly, cold, frozen). Watts evokes them in a more organically intelligent way. She seems to be feeling and thinking, especially in this movie, which requires her to be defensively tough and a little naive at the same time. Sorry I'm not making this entirely clear, but Cronenberg seems to get that Watts has an internal universe -- she's the Hitchcock heroine remixed. He also understands that Viggo Mortensen is the most sexually alive man not currently doing porn. Mortensen is one of those actors who gets more convincing, more soulful with age (he'll be 49 next month). Between this movie and ""A History of Violence,"" Cronenberg really sees Mortensen as an intensely erotic figure (he plays a mob family's ornately tattooed driver). The movie purports to be about Russian gangsters in London, but like ""A History of Violence,"" ""Eastern Promises"" is more interesting for what's beneath the surfaces. And like the other movie, that usually culminates in some bundling of sex, violence, and Viggo. Here, there's a brawl in a bathhouse between Mortensen and two goons that's one of the most astounding fight sequences I've ever seen. Both the sexual context and Mortensen's nudity are neutralized - and yet unmistakably present. The grunting, slapping of flesh on the tiles, explosive exhalations, and brute force are more visceral than erotic (it's way more excruciating than it ever is arousing). And yet Cronenberg jokingly refuses to stop teasing us with the eroticism while astounding you with the brutality, the way a bloodied Mortensen crawls across bodies. It's loaded -- a brilliant, unspoken mini-essay on what movie violence can be and often essentially is: a bunch of dudes rolling around on the floor.… Expand            "

Although the director has re-teamed with his The History ofEastern Promises is the latest effort from acclaimed filmmaker David Cronenberg, whose recent work has elevated his status from that of a cult figure to someone in the mainstrem. Although the director has re-teamed with his The History of Violence star, Viggo Mortensen, the results aren’t as satisfactory. Eastern Promises is a jumbled string of mob-related clichés that mesh into something that’s derivative and at times uninteresting. Aside from two “Cronenberg” scenes, the movie is lifeless and concludes on a note that makes the movie feel unfinished. I have been complaining about a lot of the movies at this festival being needlessly long; Eastern Promises might have been a better production had it added another 15 or 20 minutes on the back end, beefing up an anticlimactic finale.Naomi Watts is Anna, a midwife at a London hospital. After delivering a baby for an unwed mother who dies in childbirth, Anna goes in search of the girl’s living relatives. Her quest unexpectedly brings her into contact with the Russian mob, presided over by the kingpin, a restaurant owner named Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and his creepy son (Vincent Cassel). They pretend to be nice to her, but their goal is to obtain an incriminating diary possessed by the dead mother. To do their dirty work, they employ Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), whose official role is as Semyon’s driver, but who is also referred to as “the undertaker.” Nikolai has his own secrets, not the least of which is a desire to depose Semyon and replace him upon the throne of the Russian criminal underworld in London.Eastern Promises concentrates on two basic plots, neither of which radiates originality. The first pertains to Anna’s near-obsessive need to find a family for the motherless baby. We learn that she lost a child and so relates to the newborn on a maternal level. Then there’s the crime element of the story, which includes gamesmanship among the gangsters to see who will ultimately end up on top. The “surprise” twist (which won’t be unexpected to some viewers) introduces more problems than it solves and leads in part to the incomplete feeling that accompanies the ending.Cronenberg delivers twice when it comes to gore and violence. The movie opens with one of these trademark scenes as a man’s throat is slit while he’s in a barber’s chair. (Encouragement to tip well.) Later, there’s a no holds-barred two-on-one between Nikolai and a couple of thugs. What makes this interesting is that Viggo Mortensen is naked for the entire battle. This is one of those rare movies when there’s plenty of male nudity as Mortensen literally lets it all hang out. (Hetero men will be glad to know that there are a few bare breasts here and there, although none belongs to Naomi Watts.) Sadly, those are the only two sequences likely to remind the viewer that he or she is watching a Cronenberg movie. The rest of what’s on offer - including everything related to Anna - is banal. Perhaps the director set the bar so high with The History of Violence (a flawed but at times brilliant motion picture) that there was no way he could equal it with Eastern Promises, but for him to fall so far short is nothing less than criminal.… Expand            "

His simplicity, and even cliches, has a panache that any filmmaker would die to have for. His lucid flow on storytelling is why it all looks so simple and easy. He doesn't rely much upon antics, but when there are their to work upon, he makes sure he builds them up sincerely and weaves them out sharply on the screen. Take the holy ceremonial or mythological ritual sequence that these gangs go through before claiming their titles or roles in their community. That entire sequence where Mortensen surrenders himself to their religion or the game that they believe in and feed themselves in, says a lot about the integrity of these characters.These tiny characteristics of the characters is why we care, this attractive nature of theirs makes us root for them from the start. There isn't much action in the film, but only once does Mortensen throws a punch, and that entire sequence is not only well choreographed and shot but also brilliantly performed. Nikolai; the protagonist, played powerfully by Viggo Mortensen is not your average Godfather-like mafia member, he wants to prove himself and he does.Naomi Watts cloaking as Anna, the sort-of voice of the reason of the film has unfortunately very less to invest. In fact, Vincent Cassel as a spoiled brat has much more threat to convey with his uncertainty. Stephen Knight, the writer, is not overprotective or melodramatic about his content, he gives up easily but wisely, he makes sure that there is another surprising layer attached to it, to ground the emotions and justify these killings.

I really like movies set in the mob world, but the Russian mob was something I had rarely seen on film before. This film is very good at immersing us in that universe, and David Cronenberg was happy in the way he carried out this project, a little out of his usual record.The film follows a London nurse, Anna, on her quest to find out more about the young mother of a baby she saw born, who appears to have been a prostitute from the East. The essential clues will come from a diary, kept by the teenager, which will link her to a respectable and wealthy Russian family, residing in London, who are behind a powerful branch of the Russian mafia in the United Kingdom. The script, engaging and intelligent, seems credible and logical most of the time, and manages to engage the audience and instigate our curiosity. One thing I particularly have to praise is the recurrent use of Russian and Ukrainian in the film, a feature that may confuse the minds of Anglophone audiences, but which I found excellent, appropriate and intelligent, insofar as the actors did it well, without it ever sounding fake or forced. The highlight of the film is the action scenes, and particularly the fight in the Turkish baths, starring Mortensen. From there, the film continues and maintains our interest, but it fails to give us something as intense or exciting.For me, and if we exclude the films from the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" trilogies, this is the biggest and best film in Viggo Mortensen's career so far. I also liked his work on ""Hidalgo"", but I think he surpassed it here. I don't know how far his character was supposed to have the charisma he gave him, but Mortensen was able to dominate the film with a magnetic, powerful and intriguing performance. Another actor who did an excellent job was veteran Armin Mueller Stahl, in the role of the family patriarch who is the center of this film. He seems affectionate and kind, refined and very courteous, but he hides a dark, brutal and cynical side. Initially, I found Vincent Cassel a bit one-dimensional with his character too brutal and violent, but I believe the actor knew how to work that out and effectively solve the problems that the character posed to him. Paradoxically, and despite being the main character par excellence, it's Naomi Watts who went out of her way in this film, with a character who seems to be limited to following the flow of information and who doesn't seem to have much else to do in the movie. Still a word for the good work of Sinéad Cusack and Jerzy Skolimowski, as Anna's parents.Technically, it's a film that has many points of interest, starting with a well-placed and regular pace, through elegant cinematography and a judicious choice of filming locations. Visually, it's a beautiful movie that is pleasing to the eye. The sound also works very well, and the visual, specials and sound effects, punctually placed, are of quality and work well. The costumes and sets are very good, but they are within an expected standard, and the soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, didn't sound as good as I could demand in a film with so many qualities.… Expand            "

That said, the story of the film is a stunning exemplification of every problem I have with wuxia movies. The overblown symbolism, the soap-opera plot, and the ending so pointlessly depressing that you could almost picture the writer(s) laying awake in bed at night trying to think up the method to cynically jerk the most tears out of the pretentious art-film audience. The emperor in this case is so cartoonishly sadistic that I found myself thinking, ""Surely they wouldn't go to all this trouble to hammer into us how evil this guy is without planning to dethrone him in the end,"" but sure enough, they did exactly that, because having the powerful remain in power and the rebellious characters die is an ingrained staple of this genre, and the moment I realized they were in fact going to do that (about a half-hour short of the finish line), I felt like turning it off in disgust. They raised our hopes at the very end again, only to dash them. Now that's a metaphor for the movie.… Expand            "

A woman becoming sole ruler of China wasA great mixture of a detective story, martial arts and political machinations set in the Tang Dynasty with the legendary empress Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian alone is the stuff of legends and many stories. A woman becoming sole ruler of China was unthinkable. She not only archived this but did govern well for the most parts (but was disparaged by later historians). Di Renijie is also based on a real person and well worth knowing (see bonus knowledge). Back to the movie: The story is impressive with many plots, twist and reveals. Nearly everyone is more than it seems or has an own agenda. I was impressed how engaging and enjoyable the story was. With each new twist and revelation it becomes better and better. Also the phantom flames are a serious tread and used well especially in the climax. The detective story is well done and is carried by a great actor. The martial arts is a welcome addition and enjoyable. The choreography is superb (and Sammo Hung was responsible for it). Like I said the climax uses the concepts in a perfect and breathtaking way. I must praise the director first. Tsui Hark is a legend and has made many great movies like Once upon a Time in China, Chinese Ghost Story, A better Tomorrow and more. Then the actors. Andy Lau was a perfect choice as Di Renijie. He delivered the role in a way that he owns the character (Everyone who will play the role after him will be compared to his gold standard). Carina Lau as Wu Zetian is equally good. You see the weight of her burden as empress she cant show. She is also a master schemer and must defend herself against her enemies (You wouldn't survive otherwise in the court). Li Bingbing, Deng Chao and Tony Leug Ka-fai rounded up the excellent performance by the cast. At last I want to praise the costumes, soundtrack and design. All of these parts improve this movie. Overall an excellent movie with a great (detective) story with no downsides. Worth watching and rewatching.Bonus knowledge: Did you know that the main character is based of a real person?

One of the ancient ploys of the film industry is to make a film about non-white people and find a way, however convoluted, to tell it from the point of view of a white character. ""The Help"" (2011) is a recent example: The film is essentially about how poor, hard-working black maids in Mississippi empowered a young white woman to write a best-seller about them. ""Glory"" (1989) is about a Civil War regiment of black soldiers; the story is seen through the eyes of their white commander.One of the last places you'd expect to see this practice is in a Chinese film. But what else can we make of Zhang Yimou's ""The Flowers of War""? It takes place during the Rape of Nanking (1937-38), one of the most horrifying atrocities in history, during which the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the Chinese capital city and slaughtered an estimated 300,000 civilians, usually raping the women first. It is one thing for civilians to die in the course of a war, and another for them to be hunted down and wiped out on a personal basis for the crime of their race.Now we have the first fiction film about this event by one of the leading Chinese directors, who contrives to tell it through the experiences of a drunken American mortician named John Miller (Christian Bale). This man finds himself in Nanking at the time, misses a chance to escape the city and ends up hiding out in a huge Catholic cathedral, which is theoretically neutral ground.Also sheltered in the cathedral are about 25 young Chinese women, divided between schoolgirls and prostitutes. Miller is a mess in the early scenes of the film, but slowly he pulls himself together, sobers up, dresses in a priest's vestments and takes on the responsibility of protecting the women. He's assisted by a young man named George (Huang Tianyuan), whose owlish spectacles and little cap make him look ineffectual and set him up for heroism.The cathedral is surrounded by Japanese troops, who occupy the whole city and are now routinely shooting all civilians on sight. For the time being, those inside the walls of the cathedral grounds are safe, but to leave means the certainty of death. Miller's improvisations and quick thinking, and the partial cooperation of a Japanese officer who loves music and is therefore not all evil, you see, keeps the women alive, despite some close calls. This episodic cliffhanging sustains the narrative; a third of a million may be dead, but for our purposes, all depends on the survival of these young women, and the redemption of the alcoholic American. Do you get my drift?Spoiler warning: The Japanese outside the cathedral know about the schoolchildren but not about the hookers in the wine cellar. The music-loving Japanese officer invites the girls to come and sing at a party for his staff. It is virtually certain this will lead to their rape and murder. The prostitutes have also undergone a process of redemption and now, no longer crass and self-serving, they nobly volunteer to switch clothing with the girls and take their places. Then it will be up to ""Father John"" to somehow save the students.""The Flowers of War"" is in many ways a good film, as we expect from Zhang Yimou (""Ju Dou,"" ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" ""To Live""). It is handsomely photographed. Its exteriors were apparently shot on sets, including an impressive one for the cathedral and its surrounding grounds. Christian Bale grows tiresome as a drunk, but then straightens up and is an adequate hero, although lacking in depth and background. Yu Mo, the leader of the prostitutes, is played in a effective heart-of-gold way by Ni Ni. Huang Tianyuan is good as George, but there is never a danger of him stealing a scene.Now let me ask you: Can you think of any reason the character John Miller is needed to tell his story? Was any consideration given to the possibility of a Chinese priest? Would that be asking for too?… Expand            "

As the plot developed, I admired the actions of the main character, John Miller. Knowing that he's played by Christian Bale, I did find myself thinking it seemed perhaps a little ironic that someone well known for playing sometimes somewhat psychopathic killers, would play the hero but then again, he has played Batman and he's a good guy (right?).This is undoubtedly a gritty, grim, war based film. Its pretty tense and fairly engrossing, with a fair amount of bloody violence (some scenes played in slow motion to show the detail of where bullets hit, the trajectory etc.). I suppose it does give you a rough idea of what it may have been like at the time the film is set in - its certainly supposed to be (if only partly) based on true events, I assume - there's some text explaining the context of the situation we witness, provided at the start of the film. I gather the film is based on a novel but I assume there is a certain element of truth to it, regardless. I wouldn't know enough to be able to confirm or deny that as such though.It surprised me how the tone and pace of the film changed quite so quick at times. I suppose it is more thoughtful (in terms of dialogue) than other big action war films, mainly occupied in special effects. I found the Chinese women gave very good performances, showing their sadness and other emotions quite convincingly. Its quite poignant at times. Due to this and the scenes which are more thought provoking and perhaps even somewhat philosophical (to an extent), I would recommend this film, yes.… Expand            "

Tobey Maguire played Bobby Fisher and he did an excellent job.But what hurts the movie in my opinion is poor casting (in some cases, namely, Spassky’s role) and details that do not look right.""The devil is in the details"".I am a demanding movie goer, and if details look phony, especially in a bio-pic, the movie looses credibility and therefore is not a good one.As I mentioned above, Boris Spassky was, of course, a Soviet Grandmaster, and he could not speak Russian with an American accent. The actor who plays Spassky is too buff and looks more like a boxing champion than a chess player. There are dozens of native Russian speaking actors in this movie. Spassky's role was not that big. Every time he spoke, it bothered me.  An interview that Bobby Fisher gave to ""60 Minutes"" on CBS in 1972 did not look real either. Either you make it look right, or do not put it into the movie... I could go on and on.Having said that, the over-all atmosphere of Cold War times is caught quite nicely.

It tries to portray his life growing in Brooklyn and his obsession with the game of chess. It tries to explain where some of his paranoia might have started as a child as a result of his mother being a communist. I thought Tobey McGuire did an excellent job of playing him. There were some minor inaccuracies in that while Fischer did capture the rook's pawn in game 1 against Spassky, he did not immediately resign. He kept playing the game even after Spassky trapped Fischer's bishop until Spassky got an advantage that could not be stopped.There is also the matter of the room used for game 3. While game 3 was played in the room that was normally used for table tennis, the movie made it seem like several games were played there. I think only game 3 was played in that room before returning to the main playing area.I also did not care for the lady that he met and had a physical relationship with since I don't think it needed to be included in the movie.

Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.This film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.Good film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay. A man like him and a film about him should have nominated for several international awards, including the Golden Globe and the Oscars. Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way.

It's pretty clear from early on that he has some personal issues and paranoia is an obvious factor at play. It's frustrating watching someone with a clear talent take the decisions and do what he does.

This movie is for a very mature audience. The movie itself is a parody on how Asians view Western culture. Journey to the West where at one time two characters make up after a disagreement. The make up includes a high five and a manly hug. The fish speaks;""See how they are not quite kissing. impressive, no?"" The bromance of the the moment was undeniably funny when the giant fish adds his comment. That is like how a foreigner from someone as far away as China might think he is supposed to think when he sees an American TV show. The King is a loudmouth speaking unconventional and disturbing comments every time you see him. Both before and after his nature is revealed. At one point a character says ""I like the way he talks"". Reminiscent of a current political icon and the reminder that people do like the way he talks and that he has broad support even though the majority disapproves of his use of language. The problem I had was figuring out the references. It was a puzzle which I would say wasted immensely creative costumes and sets. I am sure is part of the parody Western culture. The Demons Strike back. The Minister (religious figure) is a woman. The Buddhist Monk is a phony with odd tendencies. It doesn't matter who has the last laugh. I'm laughing at their portrayal of Western Culture. If you are looking for a deep laugh fest this is your movie.

And though Wong said he does not know what his next film will be, he feels satisfied the years of work have come to fruition with ""The Grandmaster."" ""I know I'm not going to make many kung fu films,"" Wong said. ""This may be the only kung fu film I make, I don't know. I want to put everything I know about kung fu films into this film."" Wong Kar Wai is known as an international master of moody romance, making films filled with a yearning melancholy. His ""In the Mood for Love"" was the only film from this century to make the Top 25 of a recent Sight & Sound poll of the greatest films of all time. So news that he was making a kung fu film tracing the life of Ip Man, who would famously go on to train Bruce Lee, caught many of his fans off-guard. Playing now in Los Angeles, the long-awaited film has already been the biggest commercial hit of Wong's career in China, even with its unlikely combination of a rousing martial arts story and a moving tale of romantic longing.… Expand            "

Let's just say that ""The Grandmaster"" is stuffed full of slow motion kung fu choreography and long glances between Ip Man and Lady Gong, but it's less of a film than empty kung fu porn interspersed with a vignette of family revenge. Ip Man isn't really a character in this movie, but an avatar to join the kung fu porn from scene to scene. Then he disappears for nearly half of the movie so Lady Gong can do her thing. So, calling this movie ""The Grandmaster"" is problematic, because the only coherent story in this film isn't really about Ip Man, or even the Old Grand Master, but his daughter rescuing the honor of her family from the punk who her father, the old Grand Master, gave his fighting legacy to. Ip Man's story in the movie is so lightweight, that it feels secondary, if even a story at all. In the end, you leave wondering what the point of the movie was at all. Now, movies don't always have to have some super precise and epic story, but we are supposed to care about the path that Ip Man took to Grandmaster, at least that's what I thought was the point, and the writers spent barely any part of the movie telling that story in anywhere near an effective manner. Ip Man was underdeveloped. The love story was underdeveloped. The history was not woven into the story effectively. I love artistically executed films, but Wong Kar Wai has become a master of style over substance. This movie tries to do 2 things that could have their own story, one of Ip Man's path to Hong Kong, and the other of Lady Gong's quest to recover her father's legacy. It only tells one of these stories decently (Gong's) and the other it completely fails. So, we basically have a 2 hour movie with about 30 minutes that really grabs you. This is not a good movie. Don't let the decent score fool you. Everyone who I went to see the movie with agreed... If you want to see a movie about Ip Man, see ""Ip Man"".

THE GRANDMASTER reunites Tony Leung and Ziyi Zhang as rivals-cum-mutual-attracted-contemporaries Kung Fu masters Ip Man and Gong Er, spanning over 50 years in the tumultuous southern China from the beginning of 20th Century, despite of its 130 minutes length (I watched the Chinese theatrical version), the film somewhat stymies its audiences from getting a comprehensive grip on Ip Man, the nominal protagonist, instead, it leans heavily on the plot of Gong Er’s obstinate revenge for her father’s demise, maybe Chinese viewers have already fed up with a plethora of Ip Man on screen (notably Donnie Yen’s Ip Man series), so this approach lends Ziyi Zhang a rare platform to outshine Tony Leung in rendering a meatier portraiture of a woman’s fortitude and pluck in the male-dominant Kung Fu métier.The dazzling action sequences are scattered wantonly among Wong’s slow-paced, micro-distant frames zero in his players’ amber countenances, the opening fight manages to achieve an ultra clarity of splashing raindrops in the Stygian night, and the subsequent ones are all meticulously shot with slow-motion interactions and two thumbs up for all the actors, name-checking Tong Leung, Ziyi Zhang, Max Zhang and Chen Chang for their strenuous endeavor in their martial arts training.While Japanese composer Shigeru Umebayashi continues his collaboration with Wong,Stefano Lentini’s adaption of soprano piece “Stabat Mater” imprints on one’s mind profoundly in this otherwise over-scored Kung Fu spectacle. My first viewing may fall short below my much-hyped anticipation, the disjointed narrative (most obtrusively is the largely-subtracted subplot of Chen Chang’s Yi Xian Tian) and underdevelopment of Ip Man’s own storyline cast a shadow in Wong’s latest offering, one might compulsively wonder who is the real grandmaster here, the taciturnly suave Ip Man or the intrepidly determined Gong Er?… Expand            "

Ergo, I never gotten the chance to relate to the characters.  I wish the film focused on one character.*  Pull the camera back, please.Granted the film was at times had inspiring cinematography, but it feels congested with back to back close ups or half-body shots with unnecessary or misplaced change of shutter speed to normal frame rate film editing.  There was scene where Ma Sin and the Grandmaster was talking to each other.  I never caught on until 45+ seconds of dialogue.  Why?  There was no establishing shot where you know there are two people in the room.

It seems the director don't trust the actors remembering fight choreography.  The longest fight scene was Gong Er vs. Ma Sin which was the climax of the film (again, not a Ip Man movie).  My experience of the film, it is more artsy than Kung-Fu.* It needs a bit of editing love.I do like artsy films.  I do like the film's cinematography and scene lighting, but the fight scenes was cuts were too fast while dramatic scenes were too long.  In some dramatic scenes, there people turning their heads as if it was the opening scene of Michael Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal' music video.  Heck, one point they reused the same head turn of an old guy wearing a hat with a yellow-green-ish lighting.  It was unnecessary fillers throughout the film.

La sua scelta  suoi anche il soggetto e, seppur in collaborazione, la sceneggiatura   di raccontare per quadri prendendo pochi momenti significativi e legandoli con didascalie (in cinese anche nella versione italiana e lette da una voce fuoricampo): la scelta del maestro del nord Gong Yutian di fare di Ip Man il suo discepolo al sud, il rapporto dello stesso Ip con la di lui figlia Gong Er, la guerra che sconvolge la vita del protagonista, la sua lenta rinascita da profugo a Hong Kong dove ritrova Gong Er che, dopo aver vendicato il padre, sembra non avere più scopo nella vita. Una narrazione in cui non tutto funziona, con personaggi che appaiono e poi spariscono, ingenerando qualche disorientamento (ho confuso per un bel po’ Ma San con il Rasoio e, comunque, non ho ancora ben chiaro il ruolo di quest’ultimo nell’economia generale della storia), ma comunque un difetto che, dato tutto il resto, si perdona facilmente. Altrettanto succede con un finale un po’ tirato per le lunghe, anche se giustificato ‘teoricamente’, visto che i protagonisti mettono in pratica l’ultimo degli insegnamenti di Gong Yutian, la capacità di guardarsi indietro.

Technically it was very stylish and rich, but storywise it is a vastly letdown. When movies are based on someone's real life, filmmakers can change a few things to suit cinematically. That means they should not bore the audience with unimpressive and uninspiring scenes. Yeah, I did not find one single portion of the movie that attracted me.They showed stories that happened between 1930 to 1972. Over 40 years of span in the movie what I saw was the pieces of stories without exciting ones. Honestly, I think Donnie Yen's 'Ip Man' movie series were the best so far. The American Academy Award people had failed to grab those golden opportunities and now they are holding this movie's tail. Without any doubt Danish drama 'The Hunt' going to win the OSCAR and soon everyone will forget this movie.… Expand            "

Though it should be stated up front that this particular movie is in a very different style than the previous movie depicting the life of Ip Man, and that it takes a few liberties with his story for the sake of a major portion of the plot.The majority of fight scenes were choreographed as if two opponents were dancing on a stage and just as beautiful to watch. The pacing might be a bit slow for some audiences but lets be honest, that isn't the audience this movie is going for with its incredibly artful approach and major emphasis on story instead of just endless fights for no reason so the pacing argument doesn't really hold much weight.Virtually the only complaint I had after walking out of the theater was that there were some scenes which seemed unfinished or like something else was meant to be there but was obviously not. After looking into this I quickly discovered that it is because there was actually something else there in other versions. American audiences are receiving a version that is about 20 minutes shorter than the cut shown to other audiences and that 20 minutes is all story that is missing. So while the version in America suffers from unfortunate editing it seems that the full version/director's cut/international version/whatever you want to call it likely does not. Of course the only way to confirm this will be to wait until the DVD/Blu-Ray release which will hopefully be a director's cut. Even without those 20 minutes it is incredibly satisfying to watch and I would completely recommend this movie to anybody even remotely interested.… Expand            "

一代宗师,the-grandmaster,,2013,2013," Director - Kar Wai WongStarring - Tony Chiu Wai Leung, Ziyi ZhangThe Grandmaster is a film about Ip Man, a master of Wing Chun and the teacher of one of the world's greatest and best known martial artists, Bruce Lee. However, do notDirector - Kar Wai WongStarring - Tony Chiu Wai Leung, Ziyi ZhangThe Grandmaster is a film about Ip Man, a master of Wing Chun and the teacher of one of the world's greatest and best known martial artists, Bruce Lee. However, do not expect to see Mr Lee, there is only the merest mention of his name in the final moments of the film.Also, do not expect a movie chock full of action; although there are obviously fight scenes, most are short, bloodless and at times just there to showcase the amazing martial arts styles.There has been a previous film about Ip Man, entitled, surprisingly, Ip Man (2008) and starring Donnie Yen. Where that film was more action (presumably to capitalise on Yen's ability), this is more subdued and reflects on the history of not only Ip Man, but the essence of Kung Fu, in particular the style of Wing Chun. The script is littered with wise sayings and philosophical teachings giving the impression that The Grandmaster wants to delve behind the fighting and be driven by the characters.In Tony Leung the film has a strong lead. He exudes charm and is convincing in his role as a Wing Chun master (Leung is better known for his dark and brooding roles in films such as Infernal Affairs and In the Mood for Love).  He stars alongside Ziyi Zhang as Gong Er, the daughter of another Grandmaster who has a love/hate relationship with Leung's Ip Man. Zhang is beautiful and graceful, the perfect ice maiden. However it is this very quality that sometimes makes it hard for the audience to fully sympathise with her character; her facial expressions rarely go beyond a steely stare. Given she is part of the film's more sentimental storylines, it is hard for the viewer to truly understand what is going on, especially in the dialogue free parts.Unlike the previously mentioned Ip Man, this film spans a much longer time-line, from 1936 China to Hong Kong in the 50s. The Second Sino-Japanese War, which is central to Yen's film, is a small section which is only there to show us why Ip Man leaves China in the first place. Indeed large blocks of text flash up thorough out the picture to give us information and remind the audience that this all really happened.The film is beautifully shot; Kar Wai Wong uses the elements to dazzling effect. Snow, rain, blossom, steam... all are used to create a wondrous sight and visually stunning pieces (the sequence at the train station is a perfect example). The white plains of Northern China, described as harsh by characters, are nothing short of breath taking under his direction.If you want a film that gives us an Ip Man of action, then I highly recommend Donnie Yen's 2008 movie. However if you prefer a more character driven and thoughtful piece, then this will be more than satisfying.… Expand            "

To pulls out allLegendary director Jonnie To's ""Drug War"" generates a powerful suspense with extended action set-pieces that are truly exceptional, but it's the intense underplayed performances that ultimately leaves its lasting impression. To pulls out all the stops in this high-octane police procedural, shot predominantly in the Jinshan district on the Chinese mainland. This vast, operatic melodrama exhibits some extreme smarts in its bare bones approach to a drug unit's relentless pursuit of a drug cartel. The film proceeds with sequences that establish the war on drugs as neither a heroic crusade, or a hopelessly unwinnable war. They are no metaphors here  it's a world where people make choices, and as a result, events unfold simply as a matter of process.Manufacturing just fifty grams of meth in China will earn you a death sentence, and Timmy Choi (Louis Koo), manufactures on a massive scale. After a large meth lab explosion, Choi is under arrest and in the custody of Captain Zhang (Sun Honglei). Now he has only one chance to avoid execution: turn informant and help Zhang's undercover team take down the powerful cartel. As the uneasy allies must compress months of police work into just 72 sleepless hours, the increasingly desperate police are quickly stretched past their limits. As things spin wildly out of control, the line between duty and recklessness becomes vague, and it becomes unclear who truly has the upper hand.The first act of ""Drug War"" is an epic manifestation of To's talents: The camera is never in the wrong place, and we're swept effortlessly into the mindsets of a dozen people in the first act with few words or wasted gestures. The film works thanks to the riveting performances of Sun Honglei and Louis Koo. In addition to his two strong leads, To creates a large gallery of dynamic supporting characters, most notably two mute brothers played by Guo Tao and Li Jing who at first appear as comic relief, but eventually play a larger role in the story.The balancing act of the film relies on a long build-up for a large payoff. Director To incorporates just enough action and throughout to keep things interesting before the chaotic, bloody onslaught erupts in the third act. The visceral, brutal shoot-out between opposing sides takes place on a suburban street filled with pedestrians and children. It's intense and unflinching, with a fantastically dark resolution to the story. ""Drug War"" isn't particularly insightful or a profound viewing experience, but those looking for a top-notch thriller will be more than satisfied by this low-key masterpiece.… Expand            "

If any of his flicks deserves to do so, it’s “Drug War,” a rare To co-production with China. The action is set on the mainland, mostly in the gritty industrial city of Jinhai. Drug-factory boss Timmy Choi (Louis Koo) faces the death penalty after being rounded up in an undercover operation, but makes a deal with a police captain Zhang (Sun Honglei) to rat out his pals in exchange for saving his life.

Cars go crunch, bullets fly, blood spurts, bodies splatter and an unbelievable amount of cocaine is snorted. “Drug War” features a large cast of cops and gangsters, but the film’s center is the interaction between Timmy and Zhang.

From a country riddled with censorship, Drugs Wars, a film by Johnnie To, is an unbridled glimpse of organized crime and crystal meth in China. Although perhaps a tad sensationalistic, the film delivers a bold statement: the Chinese the drug market is alive and well.Louis Koo plays a busted crystal meth baron who has a choice, either help police bust a massive organized crime syndicate, or be executed. He chooses to help police.In an elaborate tireless scheme, actor Honglei Sun dazzlingly plays a police officer portraying a criminal in the attempt to infiltrate this upper echelon syndicate. The best scene of the film is when Sun’s character is forced to rail two massive lines of crystal meth as part of this act. The effects of the meth play out into a powerful piece of cinema. Post- OD, literally having come back from the edge death, the chase for the criminals continues with out a flinch.At times this police tenacity is too exaggerated to be believable. The chase for the bad guys goes on endlessly for days. None of the cops ever eat or sleep. They seem to have inexhaustible resources at their disposal. They are able to commandeer an entire harbor just to put on a show of authenticity for the crooks. The cops risk their lives over and over, and for what? To rid the world of a few truckloads of drugs? The conventional divide between the good guy cops and bad guy criminals doesn’t blur, until it does. After an epic final gun battle, we have no idea who’s who.Drug Wars attains excellence as an action movie and serves as a rare example of a controversial work to emerge from a country that produces so much state-approved propaganda.… Expand            "

Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out.… Expand            "

Claiming to have pulled off over one hundred""The Iceman"" is an unremarkable, yet competent biopic of its title character, Richard Kuklinski, providing only a limited insight into what made him one of the most prolific hit men in history. Claiming to have pulled off over one hundred hits to his name, Richard Kuklinski was a legendary mafia contract killer known for his intimidating stature, and his cold-hearted, nonchalant approach to his craft. ""The Iceman,"" based on a true story, is a fairly standard biopic that is only exalted beyond mediocrity by an imposing performance from Michael Shannon. Shannon's commanding performance is clearly the centerpiece of the movie, as he effortlessly exudes a cold-hearted confidence as a genuine, psychopathic hitman.Richard Leonard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski was a Polish-American contract killer who worked his way up the chain of command, eventually landing a position as a hit man for the Gambino crime family. The 6'5"", 300 pound ""Iceman"" claimed to have murdered over 100, or possibly 250 men (his recollections varied) between 1948 and 1986. Amidst all the murderous mayhem, Kuklinski found the time to marry and have two daughters as well, while successfully keeping his job as hit man a secret from them. Set primarily in the 1970s New Jersey, the film unfolds via episodic segments, chronicling Kuklinski's early beginnings editing porn movies and the marriage to his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder), to being recruited by the Gambino family by mob boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta), and finally his inevitable capture and conviction.Kuklinski was an impenetrable individual, and Shannon is first-rate in a suitably complex performance. Shannon bounces back and forth between family man and maniacal murderer with a sinister ease. Kuklinski exhibits an array of methods utilized to complete the task at hand, along with his trademark, freezing his victims for months before disposing of the bodies.An unusual collection for a supporting cast does a fine job overall. Chris Evans plays Robert, or Mr. Freezy, a cold-hearted killer who drives an ice cream truck who also works for the mob. James Franco plays Marty, a prospective hit. David Schwimmer plays Josh, Roy's right-hand man, and Stephen Dorff plays Richard's estranged, imprisoned brother Joey. Shannon does his best with the limited material, and Ryder gives a good performance as Richie's oblivious wife.Regrettably, a thin, all too familiar script of standard mob stories that span over decades undermines all efforts. The movie never offers anything new that hasn't been seen before, and the finale just kind of happens without much of a buildup. Unfortunately, besides seeing just how many era-appropriate hairstyles and beards its characters can model in one movie, this telling of Richard's story seems to care more about the body count above all else.… Expand            "

He was chosen after many Chinese filmmakers refused to take the project, because of the dedication it required. The film highlighted the outcome of the two ethnic groups, Mongols and Hans overlapping with the mother nature. The film should have been one of the best in the line of 'Siberia Monamour', but there a few things that did not work in its favour.It was just like the 'Embrace of the Serpent', based on a person who went to a distant place with a motive, but learnt another thing. Especially realsing the value of the native people and their land and culture. The main character was totally resembling to the Brad Pitt's role from 'Seven Years in Tibet' and very inspiring. You learn nothing by observing afar, you have to get in and get along to gain knowledge of the place. So you have to be one of them in order to see through their eyes of the place and then would find its true identity.The tale begins in the late 60s during the China's cultural revolution. Two young students from Beijing sent to a remote place in the Inner Mongolia to teach the locals read and write. Instead, one of them gets interested in wolves and decides to study them by raising a cub. During that time, the confrontation between the wolves and for the human encroachment of their natural habitant determines the future of the grassland. The ultimate face-off between them ends with the emotional.""The problem for us Mongols is that our history wasn't written by us, but mostly by our enemies.""When you don't belong to that place, you should not intervene in its natural order. The China's history is always bad when it comes to the land grabbing, either it is the ongoing South China Sea dispute or the Tibet and thousands of others. This is such a film made by China itself that spotlights their wrongdoings. Just see the film to know how much different the Mongolian, especially the nomad culture and the Han-Chinese. They' both saw the mother nature with different intentions. So imposing one land's rule to another does not work and that's the film's most important message.Very sad the film was not realistic since it was based on a real story. Visually it was very good, especially the locations were spellbinding and used so well to tell a story, but the animal behaviours were too silly, something like that happen in the children's stories. Then there's evidence the animals were harmed during making it, so feels uncomfortable in many scenes and I won't advise kids to watch it if they're very fond of the animals. In that angle this film got a completely a wrong motion picture rating. If you are a light hearted, you should as well turn away from it. Because even though they won't show the killings, in a few segment they were just graphics and make-up, but still you are definitely going to feel the pain, very disturbing film.In a few scenes, feels bad for what Mongols regrets for letting the Hans to do all the terrible things to their land despite at one stage of the history they were more superior than them. At least the film ended on a positive note, only because of the alteration in the screenplay from the controversial book. It was originally selected to represent the previous Oscars, but soon it replaced with another to avoid the International humiliation. I think the film was not that terrible, but not being true to the book was the issue. It is very hard to suggest it, it might upset you for the various reasons, so all I can say is choose wisely.6/10… Expand            "

I'm not that into documentaries compared to the feature films I watch on the regular basis,A brother's quest to learn the other side of the crime.My last documentary film was a couple of Oscar nominees that I saw before the award ceremony. I'm not that into documentaries compared to the feature films I watch on the regular basis, but time to time I try if I get interested after learning what it's all about. Likewise, I found this one, though it is not a science or nature theme that I usually prefer than anything else. I have enjoyed many murder mystery films, but this one is a documentary. So I wanted to know the experience of watching the real story with real clips and interviews of real suspect, witnesses and what the victim's family says about it.This was about one of the America's most talked crime of the previous century. It took place 50 years ago, on 13th March 1964. A young woman was murdered where nobody came to rescue her. So after all these years, the younger brother of the victim, who was a very young boy then did not remember much of the event and following incidents, is now trying to investigate and if possible to get a new perspective of that dreadful day. His journey begins in search of truth.Like any documentary films, it started off without notifying us what's going on. But very soon the basic information revealed. Bill Genovese, who is on the wheelchair tells us what he little knows about his sister Kitty. Then the focus goes back to the day she was murdered. She was alone on the street, but there were plenty of eyes that witnessed from a nearby apartment building when a man approached Kitty and what followed was a horror. No one came forward, otherwise an innocent soul would have been saved.""For years, I avoided the details of that night, because they were just too painful, but it's worse not knowing the truth.""After debating about the crime like the motive to commit it, the film right away turns its all focus on what's wrong with those who saw it, but failed to do anything. Bill meets some of the witnesses and gets their perspective. The stories of how they saw it and how they reacted to it. Unfortunately, many of them are passed away as it was a half a century old incident. Bill, as well as the filmmakers tried their best to get useful and fresh info, but the investigation did not go anywhere as we expect in a feature film.The sad part of this film is there's barely any original clips, except a few personal archive footages of the victim. Because CCTV cameras were not found anywhere near the crime scene like todays world, not even 911 was existed. They say, this crime was one of the reasons to implement the 911 concept. The incident impacted the US big, to fight crime after many debates to introduce many other precautionary measures. This topic was also used for the college thesis and other researches. So basically it changed the system that America began to fight back.It was an outrageous event, but this film lacked something. Like I said the visuals, how that night would have looked like. They should have recreated it, instead revealing everything orally. Particularly the same event described by different people who witnessed it, that was this film's notion than the crime as the title hints. So pretty much succeed in its quest, along with Bill, who led his one man research team. As a documentary film, it is a fine product, but nothing like the feature film's murder mystery. So don't go for it with such expectation other than eager to learn the truth in a realistic way. So, recommended, but only for the selected audience.7/10… Expand            "

The first half on it's own earn the first 5/10 points. It was creative, fun, and extremely well-written! However, it sets up for a completely different direction. I was expecting that the tension would continue to build solely from Liu and Shan's relationship continuing to build. I think it could have been much more well-rounded if the two were to fall deeper and deeper in love, and Shan would continue to struggle with her internal conflict: kill the man she loves to save all of her people from certain extinction. The way the movie begins, I was expecting for construction of the resort Liu had invested in to be put to the point where the builders are just about to start, still confident in his belief that Shan was just making everything up the whole time. It would have been far more interesting if more tragedy was put into the conclusion; that Liu was punished for his hubris by obliviously and inevitably causing the death of Shan and all the merpeople.Instead, we get an extremely violent/action-film style act 3 complete with lots of murdering, and out-of-context stunts from Shan that don't really make any sense for her character.

This is highly inspired by the western fairytale 'The Little Mermaid', but totally a Chinese.

An appreciable effort with the decent graphics, but it's filled with lots of negatives than leaving a good impression on the viewers.The story is very important for a film and this is a very simple and short, but the remaining is packed with the comedies and stunt sequences. The film opens with the introduction of a multi- billionaire Xuan, who unveils his new sonar project on the coast Green Gulf where marine creatures consider it as a paradise. On the other side the shrunken to a very few, the merpeople plot to kill him. So they send their finest young mermaid, Shan to seduce him, but instead it creates a chaos when she falls in love with him. The final standoff between the man and merfolks set to reveal who will be the victorious at the end and the fate of Green Gulf.If you are a die-hard fan of Stephen Chow, be prepared for a big disappointment. He's out of his comfort zone here. Thankfully, he did not star in this crap. His strength are comedy and martial arts, but this film was none of them. I mean it is categorised as a comedy, but those parts were too sensitive to call them jokes. You won't be laughing much because of the killing, hurting, tortures, kind of upsetting events draws us away from enjoying it. So if you think it is a cute mermaid love story aimed for children just like CJ7 and if you allow them to watch it, you might regret it later.""Love has no law. It is beyond any rules and boundaries.""I don't know what is the rating for the domestic release, but this is definitely an R. It is certainly for adults and not everybody going like it. Looks like a film made for the local market only despite the influence of the western fairytale. It might have done well in Chinese box office, but the rest of the world does not consider it Mr. Chow's one of the best works. I think he should stay away from such project in the future, instead make a sequel for CJ7 or for the 'Kung Fu Hustle' where his fans are very eager for the official announcement.If you had seen all his film, especially the directed ones, then you might enjoy some of the jokes from this which is his trademark. The romance was underdeveloped and then the event followed by it that brings the grand finale was too violence. That is when this fantasy-comedy turns an action-thriller without a forewarning. I was shocked for such kind of transformation in the story. I wanted to like it, but could not because I expected something like a Disney film, but it was more like a semi Tarantino film.The addition of a cecaelian character was good from the comedy perspective. But just one from its kind makes him the last survivor and have sympathy than as he's the centre of the comedy in the narration. The overall story as well as all the main characters were never established to its full potential. I'm disappointed with the writing, the director is known for genuine screenplay, but he terribly failed to please his international fans. Of all, I only hope there won't be a follow up to it because we want the old Stephen Chow. He's better than this and I'm sure he will come strong. I can't recommend this film for children or the families, the youngster who are not very sensitive might be the right audience.4/10… Expand            "

功夫熊猫3,kung-fu-panda-3,,2016,2016," I didn't go into this movie expecting a lot. I mean, who could be? It is the third movie in a franchise about a Panda who learns Kung Fu. In fact, the very idea that this film series would reach a third entry would be an unbelievable feat.I didn't go into this movie expecting a lot. I mean, who could be? It is the third movie in a franchise about a Panda who learns Kung Fu. In fact, the very idea that this film series would reach a third entry would be an unbelievable feat. But a funny thing happens in the movie and the series, and major props need to be given to lead character Jack Black. I don't think this series succeeds without him. He brings a heart yet goofiness that you can't help but feel as the movie progresses. And just like this series, which I didn't think would work, this film proves me wrong.Now that isn't to say that Black is the only reason this series works. The story is fresh in a world filled with reboots and overdone cliche stories. This film is a classic homage to the hallmark Kung Fu films of the 70s, where good triumphs over evil and the main character, never wavering and true to himself, comes out on top. And Po does just that. When an ancient villain comes back from the spirit realm, Po finds himself targeted in Kai's quest for ultimate power. During all of this, Po's birth father shows up to find and reconnect with his son, as well as take him to his hometown so he can meet all of the other Pandas. This arrival of the birth father leads to a confrontation with his adopted dad, who feels worry that he will lose his son to his birth father.This storyline hits a chord with me. I think a lot of us nowadays are either children of divorce or know someone who is. The idea of having a new extended family because of a stepfather or adopted father isn't a foreign one to children. Yet we don't get a lot of stories touching on that, or if they do it's sometimes horror stories about mean step families. This is a tale that teaches acceptance and the good things that can come from having a larger than usual extended family. A scene towards the end of both fathers holding out hope for Po and working together sends the message home that you can have more than the ""traditional"" family and gain something from it.If I had to find a negative for the movie, it would be the size of the cast list. The cast is good and they all do a good job, but it feels like there is too much going on at times for all of these characters and they become wasted in the story. I wish they would have simply had a few sit this one out instead of setting the table for all of them and then pushing so many to the fringes.The animation and story are crisp, and the voice acting is good and over the top without feeling fake. I don't know if the actors had much interaction with each other but it certainly felt as though they had a chemistry and didn't just record lines in a booth one rainy day and then move on, never to consider that job again. JK Simmons and Bryan Cranston were great, if not under noticed as usual. Jack Black was perfect for the character as previously mentioned, and the movie never lingers too long or wastes a moment. This movie is the perfect Sunday movie where you can take the family, laugh, learn something, and leave feeling good about yourself. I cannot wait to see what the filmmakers come up with next in this series, and hope it can maintain this level of storytelling and casting.… Expand            "

So if you are anThis time no Skadoosh, but Chi time.Three successful films in an animation franchise is a great achievement and according to the production house, yet another 3 films are going to hit the screens in a decade of time. So if you are an animation fan, especially 'Kung Fu Panda' and Po's fan, brace yourself for the future treats. This film was amazing. After two wonderful adventures, now this story has calmed down a bit with simplicity. Visually, it was spectacular with all those fight sequences, but the story was quite dramatised with enough comedies and then the final battle to conclude the 3rd installment on a high note.I think it was a well designed storyline in advance keeping in mind 5 to 6 films, that's why the flow was very smooth between all the three with those flashbacks placed at the right place. This particular part belongs to Pandas, the furious five were absent in most of the film, but good to see the return of Oogway. The master Oogway comes at the beginning and then during the end, though very happy for presence as he's my favourite character in this franchise. He's not a big player, but like Yoda, he's amazing and tell me who won't like him.This time no Skadoosh, but a new villain with a battle fought for a new powerful thing called Chi. Now Po got a promotion, so I'm very excited for the next film for how it will going to turn out. This is a beautiful family film and must not miss it.

When a new threat arises from the spiritual realms, he then has two challenges in front of him, one supernatural and another very different, but much closer to his heart.Just like the last two, I really liked this movie from start to finish. The animation is glorious but what makes these movies as good as they are, is the character moments that make us feel for them.

The plot itself is eerily familiar to the first one, and I felt at times I was just watching a retelling of the first movie, right down to the villain who's motives are cliche and only has a few sentences of exposition to explain their back story. To be honest, some of the plot points used in this movie are quite lazy, to the point that it became predictable. Fortunately, the movie doesn't spend a lot of time focusing on those particular plot points.

I love it when an awesome film series develops into a well formed trilogy. Obviously not the best of the trilogy(the second one was my favorite), but still a pretty good one. I like how in every film they give Po a new challenge to overcome, all the while keeping his previous knowledge intact. And the villain was badass in this movie too, he just keeps on turning masters into zombie versions of themselves, and the scene where Po does the wooshu finger hold on himself to send Kai back to the spirit world, I mean you know he's going to be fine, but still, it had me worried for a bit.

The 1st film was surprisingly good and the 2nd was even better with a more emotional story and lush animation. This 3rd film is good, although not as good as the first two. The best aspect of Panda 3 is the animation. It's beautifully animated with great detail, fluid motion, colorful backgrounds, and has very well choreographed fight scenes. The 2D animated backstory was a nice touch as well. The story is a nice conclusion to what started in the second film as it perfectly balances the comedy and drama out. The world is expanded into new places that keeps everything fresh and new. However, there are a few issues. Considering that Po meets his real dad for the first time and now has two dads; this is handled in the safest way possible with little conflict. Since there are so many new characters; this means old ones like The Furious Five have little screen time. In addition, many of the new characters like Po's dad, Mei Mei, and the villain Kai are rather bland. Overall, Panda 3 is a fun and beautifully animated film that nicely expands the world of Kung Fu Panda and has a satisfying conclusion. Although it's rather forgettable and not as daring as the second film was, Panda 3 is a fine movie.… Expand            "

功夫熊猫3,kung-fu-panda-3,,2016,2016," Kung Fu Panda is yet another solid entry in the Kung Fu Panda film series. It should be noted that while it’s subjective, my opinion is that Kung Fu Panda 3 is ever so slightly the weakest of the franchise, but that’s not a knock on the film.Kung Fu Panda is yet another solid entry in the Kung Fu Panda film series. It should be noted that while it’s subjective, my opinion is that Kung Fu Panda 3 is ever so slightly the weakest of the franchise, but that’s not a knock on the film. Kung Fu Panda 3 is often funny, beautifully animated, and features great characters. This is another great animated film for the entire family, that will surely delight people of all ages.The tone of Kung Fu Panda 3 is a somewhat silly one, much like the other Kung Fu Panda films, however it does a good job of balancing mature themes with silly humor. The film also does a good job of balancing both subtle and witty humor with more bombastic and silly humor. The humor is bolstered by the terrific voice acting of the entire cast, which is as per usual great. Many times throughout this film I found myself laughing hysterically.Another impressive element of the film is the amazing animation in this film. It may seem like every animated film features beautiful animation, but the animation in this film is truly amazing. Another impressive element of the animation is the action, which in an animated film may not seem like something to watch for, but the action sequences in Kung Fu Panda 3 are amazing. Many times watching this film the animation is so good it looks real, which is in it’s own right an amazing accomplishment.The film’s pacing is great, but what’s even better is the character development. With a story that isn’t the strongest, the characters keep the film entertaining. Besides the villain, a character who feels like a forced conflict thrown in just to give the film drama, all of the characters in this film have some kind of development. Many of the characters are relatable, which helps the audience care about them. With characters that the audience can relate to and root for, the consequences of the film feel even heavier.In Conclusion Kung Fu Panda 3 is a great fun film for the entire film with a little bit of something for everyone. The film is gorgeously animated, features well developed characters, great action sequences, good voice acting, and a terrific sense of humor. Despite the weak villain, occasionally silly tone, and some cliches the film is still very enjoyable. If you have some young kids take them to this film you’ll all enjoy it.… Expand            "

Let's first examine the secret panda village, which was lazily modeled after the Shangri-La from James Hilton's ""Lost Horizon"". Not much diversity there, only pandas, but it was paradise so that's a cultural message of homogeneity being more advantageous - and that's, um, un-American. And then there's the bio-father and adoptive/step-father awkwardness which resolves with their teaming - so there's another preachy moment about how multiple parents should partner rather than compete. And then in the end, Po doesn't prevail due to his own inner strength but the strength derived from the combined spiritual (ugh) efforts of his family and friends. I didn't see a producer credit listed for Hillary Clinton but jeez, how ""It Takes a Village"" obvious can you get?!  And finally, Po does the Neo into Agent Smith possession thing from ""The Matrix Revolutions"" - no messaging there, just another example of cinematic plagiarism.

Maybe entertaining for the little kids, but not so much for the more matured. I didn't laugh more than five times during my viewing of this film, and yep, that is a pretty bad signal. Having in consideration that Kung Fu Panda 3 was relying on slapstick and cheap humor every minute and then - even with the non-Po related scenes - it's really sad to see this kind of work being this dull, especially when Jack Black is voicing a dork, big panda and J.K. Simmons the bad guy. If something, that allowed for some great casting choice. Some of the actors meant to portray the rest of the Furious Five were underused, per usual, leaving the fantastic Bryan Cranston as Po's biological father to do the heavy lifting. His performance wasn't stellar, but he did good given the material involved.The plot is thinner and a stupid excuse to show off more bright animation, but even the latter didn't stand out quite as much as it did in previous installments. The fight scenes looked more like concept arts than real animation, which I deeply loathed. Logically, this movie is necessary, but if the plot is something like: ""Bad guy wants to destroy character X because he adores power"", then you know what you're getting into.

However, considering how excellent the first two installments were (especially the first one), it's a shame to have to call it that. The central problem with KFP3 is that it has no sense of discipline, which is ironic given the fact that the art of kung fu requires that. This movie has way too many juvenile jokes, silly side-characters and random scenes that don't fit into the film, and all of this undermines its wholesomely poignant core. Too often the film jumps from touching and deep to ridiculous, self-parodying nonsense, back and forth. Some jokes in the film are even repeated numerous times.

While Kung fu Panda 2 went a different direction than the first one by having Po wonder about his past and face his own internal conflicts, this movie goes in the same direction as the first with its ""Chosen One"" trope, but doesn't do anything to poke fun at it like it used to.Instead of proving he's still the Dragon Warrior by beating the villain, Kai, Po instead only wins BECAUSE he's the Dragon Warrior. Instead of being a parody of the ""Chosen One"" story, it has now become the very thing it mocked. While that isn't a bad thing, it does take away a bit from the charm that the first two movies had.The second and last flaw was in the fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, the animation is fantastic and looks better than ever. But for a movie called KUNG FU Panda, you'd expect a lot more Kung Fu. The fight scenes are way less common here, and the final battle is spent with flying and chi beams rather than exciting and fun to watch martial arts.Now normally for me, flaws like those would bring this movie down to a 7 from the perfect 10 I gave the previous two films. But it makes up for it with much stronger and sharper humor along with even more incredible character development. Ping trying to get used to Po's new panda family is enjoyable. Watching Po's real father learn to let Po go and fight is heartwarming. The villain is very fun and creative to watch with his weapons despite not being quite as interesting as Tai Lung or Shen from the previous films.While Kung fu Panda 3 has its fair share of issues that leave a mark on the wonderful franchise, other aspects of the film still greatly make up for it.… Expand            "

A ChineseI was surprised, I was definitely surprised.I wouldn't call The Great Wall a ""great movie"". It is a niche genre piece mixing a big of Hong Kong fighting with some fantasy type action. I was really hesitant about the movie though. A Chinese movie, set in a ""vaguely"" historical China with what I was worried would be the ""Great White Hope"". However it wasn't like that at all. In fact there was a subtle (or not so subtle) reversal of that.Instead of him saving everyone, he is saved by them. The movie portrays the greed of capitalism as bad, and the rich elite as just useless. Instead it is those who serve selflessly who are revered in the movie. Definitely Chinese politics are involved in the movie, but maybe I am not so different with my outlook that I found it an overall good message.Matt Damon is pretty good in the movie as the angry, greedy white boy from the crusades, with Pedro Pascal as his sidekick (you may know him as Oberyn Martell from Game of Thrones) who is even more greedy. They are met by one other white person, William Defoe as a very back stabbing kind of capitalist merchant as well. Matt Damon changed over the course of the movie, Pedro changed maybe a little, and Dafoe did not (and suffered for it).While those actors were as good as to be expected I absolutely loved Jing Tian (she is also starring this year in Kong: Skull Island, and Pacific Rim 2). True she didn't speak a lick of English, but she still portrayed a real badass, and had an intensity. Since I am seeing both of her other movies, I am excited to see her in those.Overall though the movie was pretty good. People complained about the CGI, but I didn't notice too much.

The detail they put into making China, it's army, it's people, it's honor and the Great Wall look great,  its really enjoyable to watch. I do not feel that Matt Damon's role washed any of that out.

European mercenaries (Matt Damon, Pedro Pascal) searching for black powder become embroiled in the defense of the Great Wall of China against a horde of monstrous creatures. Also starring: Tian Jing, Willem Dafoe. Directed by Yimou Zhang.China is an attractive movie market for Hollywood and they are also eager to spend money on making international hit movies, so uniting forces to produce some epics is an emerging trend. The American production values plus a leading star or two, combined with Chinese money, actors and locations – what could go wrong?Well, in the case of „The Great Wall“, almost everything. It’s 103 minutes of almost non-stop action so it may appeal to some, especially it (s)he hasn’t had enough of Tolkien-flavored epics populating the screens for the last 15+ years. But for others, it’s lazily written, acted and put together B-movie which has high aspirations but is too dumb and derivative to achieve that. There’s almost no story, or interesting characters. Even the massive action scenes don’t save much, more often than not the result just looks cheap. Even surprisingly cheap, considering the hefty budget of 135-150 million US dollars. This is the most expensive film ever made with (mostly) Chinese money.The only impressive thing is how orchestrated the defending side looks, all those color-coded legions, weapons, the whole shebang. It’s probably done with a lot of CGI but still… not bad.I also think the whole „monsters raiding Chinese Wall“ aspect is woefully underdeveloped and, in a bad way, videogame-ish. They don’t have much personality design-wise and making them so strong raises more important questions than the story bothers to answer.

长城,the-great-wall,,2017,2016," A film about how the Chinese built the Great Wall to keep out a legion of monsters known as Tao Tei, one could easily expect this film to be easily disposable and outright stupid. Yet, under the sure-hand of director Zhang Yimou, thisA film about how the Chinese built the Great Wall to keep out a legion of monsters known as Tao Tei, one could easily expect this film to be easily disposable and outright stupid. Yet, under the sure-hand of director Zhang Yimou, this possibly stupid film takes a unique turn into being a stellar realization of old legend (is it really a legend?) that can be mocked for being so clearly untrue, but still contains excellent themes, great action scenes, and a great imagination that always manages to get the film out of problems that could derail other film of the type. Sure, the Chinese may have not built the wall or flown on primitive hot-air balloons, but as a historical science fiction film, The Great Wall is a tight, well-acted, and thoroughly entertaining piece of blockbuster cinema.In many ways, The Great Wall hearkens back to the days of the old-school blockbuster. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, things did not need to be plausible. Kurt Russell could kick ass in any number of science fiction scenarios or a boy could meet an alien or some moron could recreate dinosaurs in a theme park. Yet, nowadays, films with such inventive and imaginative plots as The Great Wall are mocked and chastised for how dumb they sound before they are even released. It is a shame that, as a result, we get more-and-more blockbuster films that just try and show real events - my God, Marvel making us watch United Nations meetings and terrorist bombings when we could just watch Tao Tei monsters eat people instead is a travesty - and, as a result, these films just feel as though they are lacking that extra punch. The extra punch is that of creativity and The Great Wall's unique plot and setting is there to deliver in a mostly successful blockbuster that features the imagination and insanity lacking in today's blockbusters. Though flawed nonetheless with some bad writing, conveniences, and dumb characters, Zhang Yimou finds a way to make blockbuster cinema exciting once more in The Great Wall.He does this by relying upon scope and awe. With shots highlighting the absurd size of the wall to shots of those aforementioned hot-air balloons descending upon the capital of China, the film is obviously gorgeously shot and designed, but is more-so a visual spectacle. Though the film comes in at a very tight 90 minutes, Zhang Yimou infuses a sense of awe and sheer enormity with the film's expansive visuals that are designed to try and communicate the incredible scope and ambition of the film. This is a blockbuster with a sense of style and size that is largely lacking in the more contained and focused blockbusters of today. Here, Yimou constantly reminds the viewer of the vast size of everything involved with audacious battle sequences of the Tao Tei climbing the Great Wall or climbing palace towers. While the former comes in a gorgeously designed action scene where everything is obscured in smoke to increase the fear factor of the moment, both that scene and the latter one in the palace are akin to World War Z's scene of zombies climbing a wall. Similarly to that, the scene is awe-inspiring in its grandiose nature and a visual feast.However, as with any film by Zhang Yimou, this film is hardly just audacious action set pieces. Instead, at its heart, this film can be seen as a wuxia film. Perhaps Yimou's best film, Hero, is a wuxia film and many of the action scenes here show that very same style. As Commander Lin (Jing Tian) battles with some Tao Tei in the capital, she uses her sword in incredible fashions as she literally flies and dances her way through the battlefield. Using William Garin (Matt Damon) as further back-up, Lin is a high-flying spectacle of the highest order throughout this film and is the main connecting thread to Yimou's aforementioned peak as a director. As with Hero, the scenes where he is able to go full wuxia are gorgeously constructed and choreographed with it no longer resembling a battle. Instead, it becomes a dance to the death with one of them wielding a sword used for ballet-esque destruction.Similar to Hero or even classic Japanese cinema such as Akira Kurosawa's Ran, the film's reliance upon color is always purposeful and gorgeous in equal measure. The comparison to Ran is all the more apt due to the fashion in which Yimou utilizes the coloring of the armor worn by the Chinese soldiers to denote key themes or ideas about the person's role in the army. In Ran, Kurosawa took a very similar path with each son wearing a color - blue, red, or yellow - that denoted their defining characteristic. Here, soldiers are assigned either purple, yellow, blue, or red gear. General Shao (Zhang Hanyu) as the leader is assigned black as is Peter Yong (Lu Han). For the former, black is seen as a color of power and, as General, Shao has considerable power. For Peter, black is the color given to young men expected to follow in the path of their ancestors. Given his youth and strong morals, he is one who can follow i… Expand            "
长城,the-great-wall,,2017,2016," This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.                                                                                            This is a movie that pairs spectacular visuals and well done choreography with a weak story and shallow characters. But let's not go into that, but instead let's have a look at what sixty years of preparation for the eventful onslaught has given the defenders. For the Chinese defenders know that every sixty years these monsters make an attack and once that succeeds the whole world is at their feet.. eh claws.Your enemy is a reptilian dog hybrid that is the size of a draft horse. It comes with claws, teeth and a thick hide, can stand an amazing amount of punishment and is suicidally loyal to their queen. One such monster can easily take out a group of well-trained and armed humans.  The creatures have however a few severe weaknesses: killing their queen will stop them from functioning, confronting them with magnets will make them docile and hitting their eyes is an instant kill. And the defenders have one big advantage: they have gunpowder at their disposal.So armed with knowledge about a weakness for magnets the Chinese defenders neglect to send out people all over the world to find magnets or even use the one magnet that stopped the monsters in a previous assault. Instead they use ineffectual methods until saved by this one random traveler who is carrying around a massive magnetic stone that serves no purpose to him and is there only to be delivered into the hands of the Chinese as a lapis ex Machina. And even when the Chinese are aware of the stone's effect on the monsters no messengers are send out to the far corners of the empire to collect whatever stones can be found. To add insult to injury, they even take away the one stone from the wall to show it to the emperor. And what happened to that stone that saved the day sixty years before? And why was it not examined back then?The queen is the Achilles heel and the defenders only make a half hearted attempt to take her out. She is protected by a group of special monsters that can create a kind of shield to protect her from attacks, which is put up exactly the few times the defenders make an attempt to kill her.She gets bombarded once and then when that defensive shield is put up they give up. Conveniently at the end of the movie the shield is put down to give Matt Damon a window of opportunity even when the queen knows someone is firing at her. And this several times over. Yes, these monsters have become smarter, as the movie has it, but only by a margin as compared to humans.And this shows again the sheer stupidity of the defenders. They have had sixty years to prepare for the onslaught and could have created a massive supply of gunpowder weapons aimed to take out the queen.  -And note that even a few arrows with gunpowder are apparently very effective against the monsters -. Couple this with oil canisters and naphtha flame throwers they could have killed her by blowing her up or burning her to death. But instead they rely on arrows, swords and spears. It isn't that the monsters have become smarter, the humans have become dumber.But even if they did not possess gunpowder and magnets then it is baffling what preparations they made in sixty years. For instance the monsters are apparently able to scale the wall. So why put up a flat wall that can easily be scaled instead of equipping the wall with defensive measures against scaling such as barbs that point downwards? Why is the wall not equipped with extensions as to rain down boiling water or fire? Why are the ballistae put on top of the wall but not on level with the monsters so as to have them fire in a level trajectory optimizing the chance of hitting something? Why is the foreground of the wall not used to create obstacles, pits, stakes, traps and a moat instead of allowing the monsters free range of that area? Even putting up beams spaced out to allow room for humans but to narrow for these hulking brutes would have broken up their attack and allow the defenders protection.Perhaps it is because the wall, as cool as it looks, was not made to defend against these monsters but against the tribes? But most baffling of all. Why did the monsters bother with attacking the Chinese when they could just as easily move to any other part of the world that lack this defensive construction?The movie would have made a lot more sense if the Chinese had not known about these monsters. Then the lack of proper countermeasures would have made a lot more sense. The wall was made to keep out the steppe people, not massive deadly beasts. Yes, I know.. The movie has to be spectacular. But couldn't they not have put some effort into it to make it also more logical? Now it feels like the Chinese are just stupid and require a foreigner to save the day. Oh yeah, an American foreigner.… Expand            "

So, setting out the scene from an absolute perspective, are the Americans and the Chinese exchanging peace for dough? And although are unlike matters, is the money and not understanding which stirs up that two of the most powerful nations in the world join in function to perpetuate the collapse of our capitalist universe?Let's focus on the field that concerns us. It has officially commenced the struggle for preponderance in movie theaters around the negotiations between the States of the East and the West, thanks to movies from one side were a triumph in the other country and vice versa. We could see this coming for a long time; starting with the purchase of Lions Gate Entertainment, following American success of films as ""The Mermaid"" or Jackie Chan's and Jet Li's vain comedies or the partial recovery of capital investment from English-speaking feature films such as ""Warcraft"" or ""XXX: Return of Xander Cage"" which don't even managed to get off the ground in its mother country and concluding with the ineluctable kick start of co-productions, a trend that with respect to cinema, in the light of the issue, doesn't bode well at all.""The Great Wall"" is the key, a 150-million key which opens the door of victory, at least economic. Equality and inclusion have even touched this mega-production script since six screenwriters/writers are who engrave their names to the rough but eye-catching legend. It's evident how each writer instills the details of their previous works either in exegesis, creative, artistic or visual section. The story carries us to xeric European deserts, where two mercenary globetrotters, William (Damon) and Tovar (Pedro Pascal), are caught by The Nameless Order after they murder a mystifying glaucous quadruped. That frightening creature, which stands for greed, is one of the thousands of ""Taoties"" that ravage the Chinese army every sixty years, looking for revenge due to their ancestors' avarice.Doesn't it sound compelling? Sentinels wearing polychromatic attires —  ""Power Rangers"" style — divided according to their warlike skills. They defeat their enemies using of pulleys, catapults, bullet time arrows, hot air balloons, sharp weapons, bravery and too much CGI. Director Yimou Zhang decides, in a terrible way, to give more prominence to strenuous exquisite pictures as he neglects and subordinates the story, which increasingly becomes into a buddy comedy film. Yeah, they're wonderful and it's not simple to conceive and execute-correctly-fight choreographies with such agreement and style levels with a macro-budget, however, with that risk in mind, they sign up a filmmaker who stands out for his visual landscapes full of courtliness and accordance, deplorably, they didn't expect that in his first and greatest opportunity to continue in highly expensive movies, he relegate a vital aspect: narrative development.From the initial sequence, it reveals the lack of on-screen chemistry between the leading duo, forcefulness in push-lines is what is needed and the leitmotiv wanders due to weak acting tandem. William Defoe is a hollow and unjustified incorporation, a mere tool for attracting more spectators to cinemas. To a larger extent, they applied a similar strategy to Damon, who is an immediate commercial attractant; A pretty face saving hundreds of lives from a horde of demons, are they intelligent, aren't they? On the other hand, the Eastern actors, highlighting the inclusion of a fantastic warrior lady (Tian Jing), feel more comfortable, in interesting visuals that radiate artistic and traditionalist oriental sensibility.""The Great Wall"" is another horizontal graphic direct-entertainment blockbuster, however, marks the beginning for the agreements between the English-speaking country and the Chinese titan, while providing an unusual look of the Great Wall and female introduction in a feature film of such monetary magnitude. The film is inversely proportional to its pretensions and it's comforting to witness that it doesn't focus on its emboldened main character, but focuses its efforts on the battle army, their relationships, troubles, and ambitions. Nondescript characters, powerful characters, repetitive God's eye views, a crushing mise-en-scène; the motion picture is a raffle of pros and cons that set off on the wrong foot the negotiations, however, this lacking timing and thrilling epic adventure is pleasant, is the kind of movie a 13-year-old boy can't wait to see.… Expand            "

Gorgeous cinematography all the way around.  The sound is equally superb, and when the soldiers are pounding the big bass drums it will put your subwoofer to the test and get your blood pumping.  Many of the scenes obviously had 3D in mind while filming, and I'm sure the film looks great in that format as well, although I didn't see it in 3D.  Some of the scenes are laughably ridiculous, such as the bungee jumpers that try to kill the beasts one at a time.  It's very easy for the monsters to pick them off.  Some of the acting is a little wooden, although the bad dialogue is to blame more than the actors.  The obvious question while watching the movie is why don't the monsters simply climb up the wall where there are no soldiers and weapons to confront?.  But then there would be no movie as the soldiers would get killed.

长城,the-great-wall,,2017,2016," Decent visuals, but has no fresh vision.I always thought what they call the great wall of China is the symbol of the Chinese scary-ism against the mighty Mongolians in the ancient time. So when I first saw this trailer, I shocked and then IDecent visuals, but has no fresh vision.I always thought what they call the great wall of China is the symbol of the Chinese scary-ism against the mighty Mongolians in the ancient time. So when I first saw this trailer, I shocked and then I said: what the heck. You can't just hide the truth and recreate whatever new thing you want. But That's how the China and Chinese evolved for thousands of years. Like it could be martial arts, rice, noodles or the dragon, all of them came from outside. Then when I saw the film, the first scene itself cleared my doubt. It states the film was based on the legend. I thought it was a good start after the misleading promos.So this is China's effort to make a product at home par with Hollywood. They had hired top technicians from the west, that's including Matt Damon. With this kind of attempt, they should have triumphed. Yeah, the graphics were good and then if you check it out the end credits, it was actually not a pure Chinese made product as what we see on the screen, which was 99 per cent Chinese cast. 'Kung Fu Yoga' is a fine example, what the made in China looks like.The director is known for traditional films, like mixing art, martial arts and culture, particularly the middle age. I like his films of the 00s, but this one was utterly commercial crap. When it comes to the ideas for the scenes, every segment and every frame reminded me some Hollywood's greatest graphic film from the recent decade. Particularly the monsters as the zombies from 'World War Z' and the Chinese soldiers totally replicates the Elves of Woodland Realm. That proves, the Chinese are masters of copying/duplicating. IT HAS A DECENT VISUAL, BUT NOT FRESH VISION. They should have handed it over entirely, except producing it for the better outcome.It is the early 11th century, at one of the sections of northern China wall, where a couple of white men caught by the Chinese army after they were chased by a group of bandits. They have come with an agenda, but there's something big is going on. First, they have to win the Chinese trust and so they succeed on that, but things changes as the weather of the place has changed. Besides, they have no choice than to cooperate with them, but then the differences divide the two men. Who takes what path and their fates are decided at the film's climax.❝They have trained all their lives for this war.❞Many western actors, filmmakers had tried their luck in Chinese filmdom, but not all were succeeded. Tapping Chinese market is not that simple. There are too many complications like restriction in thematic and using content in the story. If that complies, then they must use Chinese cast and crew for some percentage. From all, the greatest surprise was, like Jimmy Kimmel said, why would Damon had given up the Oscar award winning role from his own production for this cheap flick from the east.I always appreciate the good films, no matter where it had come from. It all depends on the quality and the contents, but sometimes there is exemption if the production was under a limited, small cost. There's no such excuse for this film. Besides my issue was not the graphics, except borrowing the ideas from others, but it was the poor screenplay. You can clearly say that I'm not happy with this one. This is just another film that looks like a computer game as similar to the 'Resident Evil' film series.The west had given up on digital 3D, but China has a special obsession with that, and so am I. That is the reason those failed films, bet against the Dollars, which were strongly influenced by that technology, such as 'Age of Extinction', 'Warcraft' et cetera survived by earning Yuan. Like I mentioned, the director is not this kind of cheap filmmaker. But it clearly understandable that he wanted to give what the domestic audience wanted, a good digital 3D film. For that, it has to be full scale action-adventure, not filled with drama kind he's famous for.This film lacks character developments, as well as the story. You might enjoy it if you like actions. Even though, many of them are silly like acrobat women jumping down to just kill one-two monsters. On the other hand, they are the baits without followup strategic offense. Hence well planned suicide. Like that, they just wanted to give some actions without any logic behind. The common man like Chinese people (Common means Communism; definition) might be fooled, not the rest of the world. So this film is not everybody's suitable. It is a watchable film, but why? No worth at all.3/10… Expand            "

It has a real quirkiness to it, this film. I liked how different scenes are shown in different aspect ratios, with the first part of the film almost entirely seen in a big round circle shape, that turns rectangular later. I also thought it had the feel of a traditional folk tale or similar.There's some witty dialogue present and as I did enjoy the cinematography, with some nice landscape panoramas and sunrise/sunsets shown. There is an emphasis on symmetry shown in the way some scenes are shown, if that makes sense. It depicts a sort of battle of wits and I thought it was amusing seeing how those in authority squirmed with the prospect of how to deal with the unhappy wife (divorced or otherwise). I wouldn't say its an entirely funny film as such but the story does have some moments or aspects that may make you smirk or you may otherwise find somewhat pleasing.If your not keen on reasonably slow and somewhat arty films then this may be a little plodding for your taste but if yout interested in quirky and amtospheric Asian films with an element of social commentary, then I'd say this is definitely worth seeing, yes.… Expand            "

The project was decided when two leaders of the respective nation met a couple of years ago. More like it is China's move to mend the relationship with India. So except Indian cast participation and a few Indian locations, this is completely 'made in China' and for the Chinese market. Like always any Chinese product, this is not a quality product. Just an another 'The Myth' from the same director.Team up between India and China is a rare thing in filmdom, so I was curious about that. It should have been a star studded cast, but from the Chinese side, it does, not on the Indian side. The worst screenplay award goes for Mr. Tong. Literally, it is a retelling story of those great treasure hunt adventure films we had seen so far in our life. Even Jackie Chan could not save it. His presence failed to do the usual magic. Like his signature, action-comedy, nothing new to appreciate either his part or the film.The story follows the famous Chinese archaeologist Jack, who teams up with his Indian counterpart for a new quest. Equipped with the modern technological tools, the crew heads for a frozen lake in the Himalayas. It's the first and an important clue for the rest of the treasure hunt. But it was interrupted by a group of armed men and soon the tale flies to Dubai, followed by Western India, where it comes to end with lots of action and adventures.❝'Vastu Shastra', the oldest book ever written about architectural design.❞The opening scene sets in some thousand years ago. The graphics were very poor in that part. Even computer games have much better CGI work. So I lost the interest in the film within the first sixty seconds. The stunt choreography was unbelievably terrible. I mean too much unrealistic, I felt it like I was watching some kind of commercial Tollywood/Rajamouli film. Surely this film was not made under the art and the film-making value. It seems nobody was interested to participate or make a quality film. They made it to just to keep the promise made by the politicians, so it was wrapped up awfully.I thought it was a bad combination of words for a title. Kung fu and Yoga. Like the polar opposite, two different philosophies. One is violence and the other one is peace and healthy. Though not bad how those two were utilised to tell the tale.

Fine, don't care. Can't speak for final 30 min. because I walked out, however, just want to say this, because it's important. No make believe here, Sharon Tate and Bruce lee were real life, caring and unique onto themselves flesh and blood human beings. What they weren't are empty props for Tarantino to render them one dimensional silly people. Sharon appears as some 10 year old none to bright star struck girl outside a movie theatre showing her 1968 film with Dean Martin. By the way, real life bulletin here. she came horribly near to drowning after a parachute jump went very wrong in one scene. She was traumatized by that and still toughed out the movie. That's the Sharon Tate I like to think about. Resolute, determined and one who made this world a little better place for those lucky enough to have known her. A woman of a lot more depth and character than Tarantino supplied her character with, for Damn sure. Bruce Lee? let's see, we have, in this genius martial arts legend, a man who revolutionized the dicipline and sport he mastered and even expanded on, with Jet Kun Do. What does Tarentino do with him? He has him tutoring a studio set cast on martial arts philosophies before lapsing into the reverse mentality by instigating a confrontation with Brad Pitt for no actual tangible cause except to act the bully show off. Ask anyone of his friends and students, all well published interviews over the decades, and they will tell you about this gross fake representation of his true personality. I won't waste time with the rest of the film. It was virtually painful to sit through. Was Decaprio channeling Doc Holliday or something with all the gratuitous spitting, hacking, red eye tearing, and constant over acting, thought for sure he was a congestive. (he's no Val Kilmer) Where did all that come from anyway ? who knows, why waste interminable amounts of time on empty dialogue, who knows? Was there a legitimate movie in there someplace? not that happened by me before catching the exit. Summation: Tarantino dishonored Sharon Tate and Bruce Lee. That is what really matters here. period.… Expand            "

You almost wonder if he meant to write it that way, but it's hard to tell when it's bogged down with a million other little subplots that reveal nothing interesting and go nowhere.People want to keep loving Tarantino, but without his name, this film would not be getting the score it has.

We also have a brief appearance by Al Pacino, which is a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack is very well done and one of the best of the year.

Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Dalton, as does Brad Pitt as Dalton's friend and stunt double Cliff Booth.The best part of OUATIH is its ending, which contains the thrilling violence which Tarantino's films are known for. It also rewrites history (similar to Inglorious Bastards) in order to create a happier ending for some of the film's characters (though you'll need to be familiar with the Tate murders to understand the significance of the ending). While it isn't Tarantino's best movie, OUATIH is a compelling film and surely a must-watch.… Expand            "

For theOnce Upon A Time…In Hollywood is one thing and one thing only; Quentin Tarantino’s beautifully crafted dreamy love letter to cinema!With his newest feature, the current master of cinema’s vision reminds us why movies are cool again. For the first time, in a long time, there’s a film that begs to be seen, not in the comfort of your own home, not on your Netflix cue on an airplane, but in front of a silver screen, with an audience and you damn right…some popcorn. Once Upon A Time is less a film and more an experience; one where the bustling hot summer days are corrected by the high intensity air conditioning of the multiplexes; one where the theatres are a safe haven for summer love and first kisses, an experience where going to the movies is as magical as popping your cherry. That’s what a Tarantino film is like; just like when I first went to go see his Grindhouse experience for the first time, Tarantino is a visionary old soul, hell bent on sharing his memorable cinematic experiences of his past, with us today. If you are a cinephile and don’t know about Quentin Tarantino’s work, most, if not all people will tell you that you should just quit now, but I digress. Tarantino worked at a blockbuster in Hollywood, California in his early years, consuming as much cinema as possible. One of his most revered quotes to date about film is his famous line that  “When people asked me if I went to film school I tell them no. I went to films”. Funny enough, this quote captures the essence of Tarantino and his canon; an individual who entered the world of cinema out of the sheer love of watching films, just like myself.As an artist myself and lover of film, I never went to film school also. Hopefully, as someone who would eventually love to make their own films one day, I feel that this is one of the many reasons why I admire, as well as, so heavily identify with Tarantino. I also learned about films by watching them. Just like myself, the influence in Tarantino films is wide ranging. His largest inspirations draws from the New Wave Gangster pictures of France, crafted by the likes of Jean Pierre Melville, Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. All of the names listed are absolute giants in celluloid and contributed in my opinion the most to modern cinema that features, as Godard would say, “A girl and a gun”. According to Godard, that is pretty much all that is necessary to making a good motion picture. Other notable Influences on Tarantino would be essentially any film from the 1970’s because that is the era when he began to understand and study cinema, an era of films by Don Siegel, Sergio Leone and George Roy Hill.Yet while many are quick to label QT as a scam artist and artistic thief, I feel like it is my duty to rectify that notion. Before continuing on, it has to be said that art copies art, inspiration inspires and according to Mark Twain, there is no such thing as originality, only levels of authenticity. Therefore, it is my extreme pleasure to introduce and name QT a master of authenticity for his cinema. Just like when Sergio Leone remade a Kurosawa picture and developed it into the Dollars trilogy, or when Christopher Nolan gave his interpretation of the Dark Knight recently, or when Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for remaking a Japanese film and later naming it The Departed, art is not our subject, WE are its subject. Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood is the iconic director’s masterful indulgence in everything that he loves about movies and everything we should love, too! Aside from Taratino, Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood isn’t just one man’s magnum opus, but a collection of so many talented artists, starting with its cast. The film opens with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt going for a cruise to a watering hole. Dicaprio stars as Rick Dalton, a good ole’ boy from Missouri who drinks for hydration and smokes for oxygen. Once the leading man in television and film, appearing in western serials, one aptly titled Bounty Law, Dalton is on the tail end of his acting career. The Midwestern-American cowboy style Dalton knew all too well, is being suffocated and changed, no thanks to the foreign influenced, free-loving hippie movement. While DiCaprio’s Dalton emits a certain swagger that charms many, the audience comes to realize that this ‘swagger’ is less a personality trait and more a clearly stubborn, unchangeable style and resilience to the conforming of the times around him. According to Rick, Rick Dalton is still big; it’s the pictures that just got small. While it may be hard to argue this notion, DiCaprio’s riotous as the comedic force of the film. Blending well with Tarantino’s signature writing style for a second time, DiCaprio’s Dalton stutters, stammers and then collectively pulls himself together in front of a camera.… Expand            "

First off, its themes contrasting the glitz and glamor with the squalor and instability of Los Angeles have been done to death, although the character exploration of DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is pretty great. Furthermore, the film has no sense of direction, as the film goes from place to place with little flow or moments of impact usually found in Tarantino's films, making the overall film feel uneventful and boring. Finally, and most glaringly of all, Tarantino is at his most self-indulgent in this film. The film/actor nods, in-jokes, and references are solely done to serve his own ego and admiration of vintage Hollywood. The extremely stretched out dialogue and pointless scenes serve to be solely stroke his ego and throw ineffective character moments at the audience. This adds up to a painful 2 hour 40 minute run time that feels like it could've been cut down to 2 hours at least if not even shorter. These three problems among others amount to a film that wanes in comparison to the rest of Tarantino's masterpieces.… Expand            "

A total disappointment for a QT fan...The movie has a VERY thin plot. Margot's story arc (if you can call it that) didn't advance or contribute to the plot in any way and could easily be left out. The same goes for the most of Brad's, although his character has one or two scenes which contribute to the overal narrative. The most interesting was the story of the aging actor played by leo. In between you see a lot of filler material nodding to the hollywood of the 60's, which in of itself are setting the tone for the movie, but they happen way too often and are incredibly lengthy. I am talking about 10 - 15 minutes here.Aside from Leo's character, none of the characters develop in any way. The actions taking place in their lives have no significant impact on them whatsoever. For example, Margot is just there to be pretty, parties in every scene and barely has 10 lines of text. Brad is just driving around in his car beating up people. He supposedly killed his wife and got away with it, but apart from a small flashback, where you don't even see the murder!, it is not explained how this has affected him. A huge missed opportunity in my opinion. It could have given his character way more depth. As stated above, the exception is leo and his portayal of Rick Dalton. Rick ´s undergoes some significant chances throughout the movie which affect his actions. The acting by Leo and Brad ist excellent, but these professionals alone can't save these poorly written characters. The dialogues are good as always, but it all seems so meaningless.And so, the movie drags on and on for about 2 hours and 15 minutes until finally QT decides it is time for his signature filmmaking and storytelling. However! When things finally do get violent it feels extremely out of place considering the rest of the movie and the final scene with the three goons from the manson family is laughable and an extreme mess.All in all it didn't like this movie and can't recommend it to anyone. While Leo and Brad's acting was very good, the weak character building and plot in combination with the overly long filler material made me want to leave halfway through. I somehow managed to stick around, but at the end of the movie I wish that I had not. It was a total waste of time and money.… Expand            "

However, with all of the awards buzz it's been receiving, I decided to give it a look on DVD, after which I realized my initial reaction was right: Absolute utter garbage, overrated in virtually every respect (except, perhaps, for Leonardo DiCaprio's fine lead performance). What praise is there to be given for two dragged-out hours of boring, tedious, mundane activity, followed by a gratuitously grotesque conclusion that's supposed to be...funny? My only takeaway from this is that Quentin Tarantino may be a master of nostalgia in his authentic re-creation of past pop culture but little else, which, frankly, makes me wonder, ""who cares?""

It is also very clearly intended to both promote and highlight China's new military reach and ability to conduct overseas operations, but to be fair, half of US-made war movies tend to do the same thing. It's refreshing too to see how a different state approaches the topic and the film largely succeeds in suggesting to audiences, domestic and foreign, that China can give the US a run for her money in all aspects of modern warfare.

That's especially true for gay audience members who've themselves seen (and probably experienced firsthand) material like this countless times before.

As with almost all new Chinese movies I have seen recently, the third act of the film is where everything sort of falls apart. The gangster/mob boss that is fought at the beginning and the end of the film was never built up enough as the primary antagonist throughout the plot for it to make sense that he should be confronted in the end. Furthermore, it makes pretty much no sense how he is defeated with thousands (literally) of people showing up to fight he and his gang. It was not clear that they were high school students, nor was it clear why the high school students were the ones that ""had""  to do the fighting. The incompetence of the police throughout does add to the humor and some of the tension, but some of it is a little too much of a ""gimme"" for my taste. The conflict between Jianbin Chen's character and his daughter really never took shape. We see that there is conflict between them because he cannot afford to pay her tuition and she is humiliated to some degree by that, but it's a bit superficial for her to be that upset about it.

Unlikable underdeveloped characters were also a big issue. there were too many characters just to be killed off. the storys based on a chinese scifi novel but too much narration/exposition shows that the director just wasnt able to transfer the story from book to movie well. the music was also not very good. then in the second half of the movie there was too much editing which was very confusing especially when the camera was consistently shaking, switching from different locations/characters constantly..and you cant light vodka on fire like that...… Expand            "

It lacks the drama, lacking the excitement and miss the involvement of the viewer (that's why I say that is cool)Then in truth there is the opening scene and especially those 40 minutes mentioned above that are a different story. All defects already explained that in my opinion are present in this film magically disappear, and the film becomes what it should be: an exciting, technically perfect and thrilling clash-encounter between supertizi. in short, a masterpiece (if you notice, also and above all from the point of view of directing the film changes a lot bringing us abruptly to the movies).After the airport scene, the situation is as before but with very muted aforementioned defects (the direction changes again!).The conclusion I consider it a less courageous film TWS and therefore do not live up to its predecessor.… Expand            "

However, these are not the only players involved in this superhero extravaganza, with Captain America being joined by the Winter Soldier, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and Hawkeye, and Iron Man teaming up with War Machine, Black Widow, Vision, and newly introduced, Black Panther and Spiderman. Civil War is definitely the most intense and mature of all the MCU films and what the Russo's (directors) really grasped well is creating an environment where we as the audience can invest and care for these heroes on an emotional level, which is testament to what the MCU has done with all these well-developed characters. Throughout all these years, we have seen all these characters evolve, not just as heroes but as people. The histories of both Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are central to the story that develops in Civil War, and the events that ensue creates the division within the Avengers, as well as the people watching the film unfold. This also helps our villain, Zemo, increase his influence on the audience, because as invested viewers, whether you picked a side or not, no-one wants the villain to achieve his goal. With great writing, great directing and great acting, this film acts on what it intends to achieve superbly, creating the best Marvel film seen to date.… Expand            "

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER BEFORE STARTING REVIEW!!!**********Great. Now that you're past the buffer, let's talk about this movie. Captain America: Civil War is the ultimate movie in a trilogy of Cap movies in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Many people are labeling it Avengers 2.5, but I see it as the future of Marvel movies to come.Before I rave about this movie, let's talk about some downsides. There were a few moments where I was thrown out of the action (and I don't mean the Jason Bourne-type action you may be thinking about, I mean the plot, the general action of the movie). One was near the end of the airport scene (which will be discussed) where Scott Lang is taken down and gives a crummy quip. This is pretty nitpicky though. Second was the moment where Cap and Sharon Carter share a kiss. Cap says it was a long time coming, but this moment had little setup. Their relationship started in the last movie with them being neighbors and did not range farther than that. In this movie, Sharon is an ally to Cap. I believe that had they strengthened the relationship in the previous movie or simply laid more groundwork in this one for a connection, the moment might have been more believable. NITPICKING! Lastly, the camera movements regarding the action sequences at the mission in Lagos is dizzying, and not in the good, filmmaker way. I've seen Cap 3 twice and both times I got nauseous just trying to follow Black Widow with my eyes. But again, nitpicking.Now I've heard the argument from some people that it is unfair to have such connected movies in this Cinematic Universe because the emotional and storytelling heavy lifting has already been done in previous movies that have come out years before. I think that argument is utter bulls**t. It is. Let's get a reality check: people go and see these movies. Not just some, not just comic book fans, but a LOT. OF. PEOPLE. This movie as of now worldwide is on the verge of a billion dollars and is only on its third week of release. Both Avengers movies grossed over a billion dollars and the previous Captain America movies have made bank, not to mention every other MCU film. No film in the franchise has been a flop, not one. And in this culture we live in today, infused with fame and pop culture, there are enough people out there willing to help those who can't see the movies prior.Think of it like this. You're reading Harry Potter. All the books in the Harry Potter series are part of a shared universe, you gotta read them in order to understand the emotional weight of the story, not to mention the bare bones logic. You wouldn't read Order of the Phoenix without reading Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire. You would be lost, seeing two years go by of story.And so it is with the MCU. While Marvel has done a stellar job with making great movies that standalone, the cohesion of the universe only ever adds to the power of the story and Captain America: Civil War is a testament to that. First spoiler of the day: The ""twist"" at the end of the movie that gets us our final fight in Siberia was actually shown to us very subtly in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Had you not seen that movie, then you still weren't left out to dry because Civil War had enough setup to understand Tony's relationship to his parents and Bucky's involvement in the Winter Soldier brainwashing program. Having watched the previous movies only adds to involvement of the audience.Let me say this of the MCU before I move on. I heard some people I knew who watched the movie say that it was very confusing (they hadn't watched anything but Avengers movies) and what they were confused by was where characters were at in their story. I say that this is not an issue of the filmmakers but rather the audience. When you walked into the theater to go watch The Hateful Eight and you see a snowy mountain and Tarantino doesn't outright tell you where the carriage is that's traveling on this mountain, you don't get to complain about not understanding what's happening. It's all in the discovery. I'm gonna leave it at that.Now time for praise. If you'll sit back and relax, you will get so much out of this movie. If you are on the edge of your seat, the same will happen. There are so many moment that are just eye-popping. The soft moments are tender, sweet, and necessary for the wonderful pacing. The actors are stellar, especially RDJ in what is my favorite performance from him yet. Seriously guys, that **** killed his mom. Root for RDJ once in a while. Zemo is a bit confusing on the first watch, but is so much better on the second. GUYS!!! Watch movies more than once. You're supposed to. You can't get everything out of one watch.Now for the highest praise out of the whole movie: Three characters. Spiderman. Black Panther. And Giant Man. You heard me. I won't say more because you just have to experience the dedication these characters add to this movie.… Expand            "

In the original Avengers the friendly fights were done in the forest so no one will get hurt and there's not much to destroy. In Civil War the characters are doing ungodly amounts of destruction to everything around them. All of this while the characters claim to 'still be friends' making it even more ridiculous. Hello, aren't we trying to make amends for the destruction we caused in the previous movies? And what is Cap's end game? Does he honestly believe he can go up against the entirety of the UN?The pacing also needs a lot of work. It falls into the classic trap so many Marvel movies are falling into recently of going much too slow in the beginning and going incredibly fast at the end. I think it's much worse in Civil War and other global scope movies than say Ant-Man because we're constantly jumping back and forth between random locations with minimal context.Also the story is weak. This is the problem with cliffhanger movies. They just don't have any obvious conflict in them. It's just one meandering story with no obvious end. There's just no build up or suspense.

Too many characters and calling them by various names being its biggest sins, as it simply makes it hard to follow. The action scenes are poorly done and solely done in the name of, ""oh that's badass"" or ""oh he/she is hot"". Even worse, they are poorly shot and wholly disorienting when they occur. The quips can be funny, but the comedic timing is dreadful and undermines potentially serious moments. Even worse, I f***king hate Iron Man. I hated him before this movie. I hate him now and he's like half the movie. The Iron Man movies are the only Marvel ones I do not like and it is because of how much of a whiny, self-righteous brat his character is that I truly despise him. This ultimately hurt here and made the overall film incredibly underwhelming. That said, the new character introductions are appropriately epic and done very well. The film is incredibly entertaining with good fight scenes (minus the disorientation), it is funny, and the disagreement is very well laid out as opposed to the film about the sons of Marthas. The acting is more than acceptable here and thoroughly feels like a comic book movie. Overall, after enjoying the first two Captain America's, Civil War was wholly underwhelming due to Iron Man and being overstuffed with characters (who are referred to by their real name and superhero name interchangeably). Civil War did not live up to my hopes.… Expand            "

He looks just like Peter Parker despite the flaws from the writing.Criticism* The title of the movie being the third installment of Captain America instead of just calling it ""Marvel's Civil War.""* Too much characters who don't resemble at all to the Captain America franchise, including Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, The Vision, and especially, Spider-Man.* Special criticism: SPIDER-MAN. He was supposed to be a very inspiring character with huge emotional background and very trustworthy to fight with. I prefer to call him, Peter Parker, ""Jr."" because he wasn't that young in the comics when he became Spider-Man. He got bitten by a spider during his senior year of high school. I really hate how they presented Spider-Man in the MCU because it doesn't relate at all to how Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield portrayed him. Tom Holland was better than Tobey Maguire, but not as good as Andrew Garfield, because Garfield put a lot of emotion and heart while in the suit. In this movie, Peter said it's been 6 months since he got his powers, but he never explained why he became Spider-Man to being with. That reason will always be Uncle Ben. When Spider-Man said, ""Holy **** when Ant-Man grew, it literally killed my childhood. So, **** you, Marvel.* Aunt May's casting choice was the worst. It's a way to make humor gimmicks like Iron Man flirting with her in front of Peter. Ugh!* Civil War was supposed to be the darkest of the MCU, instead there was too much humor and too much meme references to mock.* The Vision wearing human clothes. Are you ****ing kidding me?!* It was meant to a Captain America movie, but they barely even focused on him. They focused more on the supporting characters than the actual main character.* Stan Lee calling Stark, ""Stank."" Imagine replacing ""t"" with a ""k.""* Special criticism: No deaths involved. Marvel is so much of a **** that can't kill off any character in Civil War.* Part Two of Special Criticism: The comic, Civil War, was supposed to be the most devastating storyline to be put in Marvel. What the hell was Feige thinking not resembling the majority of a darker tone from the comic to the movie? In the trailer, we assumed that War Machine was going to die and have Iron Man avenge him by fighting off Captain America even more. Nope, he gets paralyzed in the leg. That shot from The Vision could have killed him even before the fall.* Part Three of Special Criticism: The most significant part of the comic was the aftermath of Civil War: THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN AMERICA. In the end of the comic, Steve Rogers gets assassinated by a hypnotized Sharon Carter during his conference at the White House. This made a huge impact to the Avengers. Iron Man mourns for Captain America and regrets signing the Ant-Registration Act, including the harm he put into The Avengers. Iron Man was so mournful enough to recreate S.H.I.E.L.D. (New Avengers Initiative). Sharon Carter encourages Bucky Barnes to fulfill Steve Rogers's role as Captain America. He refuses until he finally remembers his entire friendship with him and Steve. He gazes at the suit and experiences hope. I wanted to see that as the end of the movie, BUT NOW I CAN'T. In the movie, Captain America is still alive and Bucky Barnes freezes himself again with no motivation (other than until the hypnotism wares off, but that doesn't count). What the hell have you done, Kevin Feige?… Expand            "

The airport scene is hands down the best action scene in any comic book movie ever. Not just this, but chase scene with Bucky and Black Panther was just awesome, and the final action scene is shocking, dark, and surprisingly violent for a Marvel movie. Pretty much the only thing you could criticize about the action in this movie is the shaky cam in the first few fights, but it wears off later on.The characters. Spider-Man!! F**K YES! FINALLY.... A PERFECT DEPICTION OF HIM! Tobey was a crappy spider-man and a great Peter Parker, and Andrew Garfield was a great spider-man and a crappy Peter Parker, but Tom Holland knocks it out of the park for both! Chadwick Boseman also played an amazing Black Panther. And best of all, they both play completely essential roles in the movie! Not just shoehorned in at the end. The rest of the cast (Cap, IM, BW, etc., etc.) is as awesome as they've always been if not better. But forget about all that, because it's time to talk about who is possibly the most underrated villain EVER! There's pretty much been no above average villains in the MCU up to this point besides Loki and The Winter Soldier (If you would count him as a villain), but this guy honestly breaks the trend. Zemo's motivations made complete sense and he wasn't just an over the top ridiculous antagonist. And if you think about it, he actually caused the most damage to the Avengers out of any MCU villain...Finally, the story. We all knew going into this movie that it wasn't going to be on nearly as big of a scale as the Civil War comic, but integrating the Civil War into a Cap movie like this is pretty genius. At it's core, this is a sequel to Winter Soldier. In that, Bucky Barnes is completely integral to the plot and the way they link his backstory to Iron Man is just phenomenal. The movie is two and a half hours long, and it absolutely doesn't feel like that, because it's so well paced and there's never that one moment where you aren't glued to the screen. Although admittedly the movie didn't take too many ""risks"", I understand why.In the end, like I said before, in my humble opinion, this is the best Marvel movie to date and is also the best CBM ever since TDK. In fact, the way it leaves you at the end of the movie feels a lot like TDK. In my mind, this is the first chapter of the end of the line that the MCU has been leading up to. And that makes me simultaneously sad that we're approaching the end, but super happy that the end is oh so FANT4STIC! Oh yeah, f**k that movie.… Expand            "

Maybe 6.5/10. Not BAD per say, but this movie made a lot of the same flaws that Age of Ultron did, mostly due, I suspect, to a time crunch; such as hurried plot progression and failing motivation for both villain and character. Adding in Spiderman was just Marvel wanting to show off the character they'd bought but it really detracted from some of the gravitas. He was very good but he didn't seem to fit in with the overall story. And the side-plot involving him was one of the elements that had been a worry for the movie; that it wouldn't be a true Captain America movie as it wouldn't be about him as much as it should've.The movie was built up around the Accords but they pretty much were forgotten for the entire second half and it just became about Iron Man wanting to prove himself right over Captain America. They were the motivation, yes, but that became very hard to see by the time of the airport fight scene. And of course there was a lot of time given to the other Winter Soldiers but then it cut off when he killed them. A twist, yes, but one which wasted massive amount of film time. The fight scenes were decent but some of the employed elements, such as Ant-Man's surprise, were rather surprising--and not in the good way. It was the sort of thing that really didn't belong in a group hero movie.When it comes to movies about conflicting ideals, especially when, as in this case, both sides make solid and understandable points, it is usually important to give both sides their due so, even if one wins, both are understood. And it had that covered quite well early on with Tony's guilt and Steve's hero complex, but that theme was lost somewhere along the lines. Eventually Tony's team (minus Natasha) seemed composed of people seeking revenge (T'Challa), gratification (Tony), or just following blindly (Spiderman+Rhodey). There wasn't even any pressing NEED for them to fight, and that was what made the movie as a whole rather hard to swallow.Characterization, as with the plot, began well before taking a nosedive about halfway. There was a nice base, each character given their due and specific reasons to support their side, but as the difference in opinions arose it was lost by the wayside. Some of the most important elements were forgotten in place of cheap drama; Tony became a hothead with no care for Steve (a feature which was the entire point of Ultron), Peter became a fanboy without the ability to think for himself, and T'Challa sought revenge with no other thought through his head. (Or, for the record, explanation for his own abilities and suit beyond a passing comment of it being an heirloom.)All-in-all the movie gave the feeling that they were heading in one direction beforehand but a last-minute change forced them to scrounge for an alternative ending. Not quite bad, but shall we say... lacking.… Expand            "

Arguably the best of those characters is Captain America, simply because he's the one character people are most likely to relate to. The Captain isn't a billionaire or a king, and he doesn't have super abilities from another planet, he's just this wholesome, level headed guy, who you can't help but like. In his third feature film, Captain America (Chris Evans) comes into conflict with other members of the Avengers, as following a tragedy, the world governments decide the Avengers shouldn't be free to do whatever they want anymore. Some of them agree, some of them don't, and that's where the split occurs, leading to one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. When I saw the previews for this film, I couldn't understand why the story wasn't used for an Avengers film. Even while watching it, I noticed that much of the focus isn't solely on Captain America, and I became even more convinced. This film was not a true stand alone like we've seen in the past, and that's because I think it was more of a transitional project than anything else. Clearly it seems as though Marvel is putting Captain America on the shelf for a while and trying to draw our attention to the new Spider-man series, starring Tom Holland. I must admit, I have never really liked Spider-man. I always saw him as bland and weak compared to the rest of the Marvel universe, but Tom Holland changed my mind in this film. He was all personality, in a way that Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield couldn't even imagine. The charisma this good looking young actor puts out there should be enough to get anyone excited for the new series. As far as this film goes, the story was a bit complicated, and in my opinion there are far too many characters involved for this to be titled Captain America. In that sense I was disappointed, because I love the character, and was looking forward to another feature film about him. On the other hand, amazing new characters were added, a major story line was introduced into the Avengers genre, and I got to see the best action sequence I've ever seen, so while it wasn't what I expected, I still highly recommend seeing this film.… Expand            "

I believe the first Captain America film was another fun MarvelAnother great release for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and an excellent conclusion to what I think is their strongest lone superhero films: the Captain America trilogy. I believe the first Captain America film was another fun Marvel superhero movie, but with Winter Soldier and now Civil War the bar was certainly raised for the MCU. Within Civil War there is the classic humor, but it still maintains a much more serious and pressing plot, pitting friends against each other and dividing the Avengers team. The film's action is unparalleled as far as the rest of the Marvel films and Downey's Iron Man performance as well as Evans and the rest of the cast's acting is great. I thought the creators did a very good job of letting all the superheroes have their moments of glory, as well as introducing new players like Black Panther and Spider-man (both awesome), while still keeping the primary focus on Captain America and his loyalty to Bucky, his lifelong friend. A must-see for general movie fans, not just superhero fans. 8.5/10. Side note: the airport scene is incredible.… Expand            "

This movie has many similar aspects with DC Batman vs Superman movie. It is interesting to compare these two movies, because here is very visible difference and how it should be in BvS movie. Reason why BvS does not make sense and this movie does is, that Marvel created a story for every character, so you know who are they, why are they the story and what problems they have to solve. This movie is great in visual, but I have a problem with some action scenes. Sorry, but we are in 2016 and some of the scenes looks ridiculous and absurd, when, for example, human-hero survive bomb  explosion just because he jump away from the bomb, but the bomb explode just about 2-3 m far behind him. The movie tries to be more darker and solve some serious moral superhero questions, but some jokes in thrilling moments are just not suitable and damage this serious atmosphere.

Evans commands the film and everThe cast, once again, as usual, is a standout. Chris Evans still proves that he is Captain America, distilling in him doubt and a questioning manner, while also showing him as a conflicted and true leader. Evans commands the film and ever scenes that he is in, proving that the Marvel Cinematic Universe isn't complete without the character. Robert Downey Jr. once again proves that he is Tony Stark and that no other actor can depict the character. Downey takes a backseat to Evans in good fashion and doesn't try to take the film away from him. This is more Captain America, than Iron Man, with Stark only arriving into the film when necessary and never hogging the film away from Evans. Downey and Evans work well together, while successfully showing the different sides of both characters: Captain America as the leader and Tony Stark as the billionaire, who after the events of Age of Ultron, is guilt ridden. His decision to favor oversight comes from a civilian in Sokovia being killed during the battle, which has a huge impact over the film. Sebastian Stan makes a welcome return to Bucky Barnes, the brainwashed friend of Captain America, code-named the Winter Soldier. Once again this character proves that the Captain America trilogy is about one thing: brotherly love. Stan's depiction brings a sense of doubt and confusion, since he still trying to piece his entire life together, while it also partly ties certain events together. Scarlett Johansson is marvelous as always as Black Widow, delivering great lines and working well opposite both Evans and Downey. Anthony Mackie is once again amazing as Falcon, Captain America's new ally. Don Cheadle still works well with Downey and in the role of James Rhodes, having replaced Terence Howard in Iron Man 2. Jeremy Renner makes a great, small appearance as Hawkeye, as does Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, lending a sense of comedy to the film and giant surprises. Paul Bettany depicts Vision as an android attempting to come to grips with the world, while Elizabeth Olsen gets to further explore the character of Scarlet Witch, sharing some really great scenes with Bettany. William Hurt makes a welcome return to the MCU as Thunderbolt Ross, now Secretary of State. This approach seems to be done as a way to still make clear that The Incredible Hulk (the black sheep of the MCU) is still part of the universe. Hurt shows Ross as a complicated politician. Frank Grillo makes a great, small appearance as Rumlow at the beginning, while Emily VanCamp makes a welcome return as Sharon Carter and Martin Freeman is introduced to the MCU in a small role as Everett Ross, who will undoubtedly return for future installments. The real standouts in the film are Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. Holland steals the scenes that he is in as Spider-Man, working exceptionally well opposite Evans and Downey, as well as Marisa Tomei, who depicts Aunt May. Holland is comedic, depicting the character as a nervous, geeky, unsure character. Holland seems to be the definitive version of the character, delivering a far better performance of the character than Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the two of whom are also fine actors. While some may say that Spider-Man is only featured in the film to introduce him into the MCU and also to setup the planned standalone film, I believe that Spider-Man worked out well in the film and lend a real sense of stamina to the film, especially the big fight. Boseman is amazing as Black Panther, delivering the character with menace and true purpose. Boseman is calm as the character, while the introduction is wild and spectacular. Daniel Bruhl makes a great appearance as the villain Zemo, who has a huge connection to the events of the film. While the character is different in the comic books, I can defend the change that had to be done, since it supports the film's plot and layout. Bruhl's approach to the character, as a calm and calculating villain, as well as the villain itself is spectacular, while he has got to be the best villain that the universe has had to see so far.

It is worth noting that this may be my favorite villain from all of the Marvel movies so far.The stark difference between the critical reviews of Civil War and Dawn of Justice is utterly baffling to me. The films share similar strengths and similar weaknesses. Both film studios need to straight up fire their editing crews, because Civil War (like DoJ) suffers from jarringly bad editing. Where DoJ suffers from scattershot editing that puts together the scenes in an unintuitive way, Civil War seems to start and stop multiple times before it finally hits its stride about halfway through the film. This is made even more clunky as the film tries to introduce multiple new characters without ever slimming down the main cast. Fortunately the new heroes are all well played. Also, Civil War's actors are often talking off-screen even during pedestrian conversations, and it's really obvious that the two actors are not in the same room, which dramatically weakens a couple key scenes.… Expand            "

Admittedly this is a few notches up from previous efforts and, despite a patchy and inconsistent screenplay there is actually a germ of a good story being played out, albeit at monstrously excessive length. The mystery surrounding the deaths of Iron Man’s parents; the brief introduction of additional warriors and a fantastic stunt set piece involving Captain America and a helicopter are all plot points or moments that promise much. Unfortunately, pasting such highlights between endless fights and battles ensure that the story’s flow becomes a stop start affair. These action sequences are not only lengthy and unimaginatively staged, but are also loaded with the usual tiresome banter and unfunny lines which severely disjoint the passably good story and seem to have become a staple ingredient of these films. Technically the achievements are good enough, but it has to be said that the cinematography is very dark for much of the time. Also, the special effects whilst perfectly acceptable are not really showcasing anything new. Fans will, I’m sure, lap it all up.

Okay I am now explaining the plot but seriously it was handled greatly and make sense cause we know why they fight and why they where split.You will be confused of which side are you on cause both men are right in their respective ideologies.Marvel did a great job between the Punisher and Daredevil's ideologies and why not do a great one in ""Civil War"".So Captain America:Civil War is Marvel's strongest film with a plot that works,characters that we love emphasizes their abilities and powers and stay lovable.

As a movie civil war was good except it just lacked one thing: you can tell from the events of the film that the reason for the heroes fighting isn't the registration act, its because cap wants to protect bucky from the rest of the avengers. The main reason why panther joined in the first place was because he thought the winter solider killed his father, evidently he didn't. And at the end of the movie when we see Cap and Stark beating the **** out of each other, it isn't because of the registration act, it's because Stark finds out that the Winter Solider killed his parents and Cap defended him using the excuse that he was being mind controlled and didn't do it willingly, unlike what you've seen in the trailer which gave you the idea that the reason for them fighting is the Act.But the movie was good in more ways, Black panther was a very interesting character so was Tom Hollands Spiderman. The Airport fight was probably the best scene in the movie, it had all the elements need to give the viewer the feeling that these people are willing to beat the living crap out of each other.As a DC fan and as much i hate to admit it, Civil War was much better than Batman V Superman. It actually gave you a feeling that there is an actual civil war going on, unlike Batman V Superman which promoted the film for three years and showing glimpses of the fight making people think it was going to be awesome, but it ended up being a very short fight with a very quick conclusion (Not saying BvS was horrible).… Expand            "

In both films their authors decided to create confrontation between ""good"" heroes, thus adding philosophical depth and psychological authenticity toThe ""Civil War"", of course, can't avoid comparisons with the recent ""Batman v Superman"" film. In both films their authors decided to create confrontation between ""good"" heroes, thus adding philosophical depth and psychological authenticity to the heroes. Also both films have raised up a problem of the so-called ""collateral damage"" and responsibility for consequences of superheroes actions.While not referring to the question ""which movie is better"", I'll try to ask myself a question ""why the theme of confrontation between the ""forces of good"" appeared in the film adaptations now?"" I think the answer lies in the domestic US problems. Criticism of Bush's foreign policy and national security measure, I think, were essential in raising ""collateral damage"" problem and control of power in original comic book series. Coming to power of the ""leftist dove of peace"" Obama that has transformed now into a crisis of the US political establishment, manifested in the appearance of presidential candidates like socialist Sanders and populist Trump, tells about upcoming serious reformatting of traditional American values. What twenty five years ago has seemed unshakeable foundation of the US - individual freedom, liberalism, individualism, Christianity, reliance on the middle class, the belief in the ""American mission"", the constitutional rights, the right to freely carry weapons, the belief in the intransigence of good and evil (so- called ""freedom values"") - is increasingly shifting now to the so- called ""safety values"" - strengthening of state control and regulation, taxation, reliance on large corporations on the one hand, and people with low incomes, on the other, with the simultaneous impoverishment of the middle class, atheism, restriction of the right to carry weapons, moral relativism, non-interference in the affairs of third countries. This US' ""offset of values"", with the polarization of the supporters of ""freedom values"" and supporters of ""safety values"", I think, is reflected by the both blockbusters.In the previous Russo's work with Captain's story we already saw clash of these values when heroes revealed that evil has grown up inside of SHIELD and its operatives and head were converted to the HYDRA's side arguing that security and control will finish the world's chaos. In this Captain's story the same message was hidden by Ross brothers more subtly, when right and wrong sides are not so clear. As in life, it is difficult to see the evil in someone everyone accustomed to consider to be a hero and who considers himself to be good (as well as all villains).On the one hand there is Captain - the embodiment of the ""freedom values"" - who believes that you can not shift the responsibility for your actions on others including the state (like, for example, the Nazis did) or a coalition of states, knows that there ""at the top"" just ordinary people with their ambitions and desires, and that he won't become a puppet in the hands of cynical politicians only in order to get rid of guilt and absolve himself of responsibility. He is the embodiment of belief in uncompromising, absolute good and evil, inviolability of principles, justice, even if they are not supported by the majority, which out of fear is ready to give up freedom in exchange for security, to exchange risk-taking birthright for a guaranteed onion soup. On the other hand there is the Iron Man, oddly enough, the epitome of the ""security values"" - he comes from large corporations, he wishes to subdue the group's activities to external control, to absolve himself of responsibility, and thus in some way (how?) to protect others from ""collateral damage"".If motivation of Captain America is transparent - responsibility, adherence to the principles and concepts of good and evil, even if they are contrary to written laws, as well as loyalty to friendship, the Stark's motivation is questionable. Does he made his decision due to the conscious or unconscious desire to split the group and take the leadership from Captain America, isn't there monstrous selfishness hidden behind the rantings about the need to ""control"" (again, it is not clear how such controls could prevent ""collateral damage""), maybe it is thirst for power and, at the same time, desire to absolve himself of any responsibility for the ""collateral damage""? Look at the motivation of the real villains (Commies, Nazis) - they wanted to create a perfect system with total control for the ""security"" of common fellows, who they sought, were unable to bear the burden of freedom. Ultron was alike, but he grabbed his delusion ideas from Stark. For me, Stark is the main villain of the film. He begins to pursue those who disagree with him - put a pressure on them, put them (Wanda) under arrest. It is similar to most of the tyrants, a typical villain who wants to trample his opinion as one and only and to eliminate all who disagree.Behaviour of Black widow seems illogical - she is a clear candidate for Captain's team (unless she has stayed with Stark for sabotage like in the hangar scene). But suffering from guilt Wanda would rather choose Stark's side that allows her to shift responsibility to someone else. But she has chosen the right path of ""growing up"" - accepting responsibility. In the ""Age of Ultron"" she had read Stark's mind and warned Cap that Stark is ""capable of anything"".Distracting from the current political and philosophical background of the film, it may be noted that in terms of action this Marvel's cinema-comics keeps the style and the brand - despite the seriousness of the plot, Marvel's ease and jokes are still there even during fierce battles.

中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," ""The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!""""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have""The Opening to Marvel: Phase Three is a simple: Oh, by God!""""There was no way more perfect and majestic to start Phase Three of Marvel Cinematic Universe""This ""Captain America: Civil War"" Review contains some spoilers. If you have not seen ""Civil War"" film, please, do not read, this could destroy it.A few years ago, approximately, five or six years, Marvel had in its hands one script and one proposal that possessed enough unknowns. That project would receive the name of ""Avengers"". The biggest concern for the owners of the company was supposed to make a film where not only a hero was the protagonist, may break the story, be boring and completely commercial. Two years later, on May 4, 2012, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" landed in all movie theaters, solving each and every one of those unknowns on just the first day at the box office. Today, Mayo 2016, ""Civil War"" increases its number of participants to 12 heroes and 3 villains. Will this be the film event of the year? I don't know, I can only assure, Marvel has lost the fear and perhaps in the next few years its projects could reach total perfection (Avengers: Infinity War Part:1 or 2).Based on the Comic of 2006-2007, movie serves as a sequel to ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". After all the fighting and disaster in ""Ultron"", the Avengers return to discuss issues still more violent than in 2015, the death of innocents (something very, very similar to what we saw in ""BvS"", with Superman, and then say that they are polar opposites) and the dilemma, Does our help really help?Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt, reprising his role from The Incredible Hulk) immediately ordered a conference to bring together to acclaimed heroes. After showing the dramatic and terrible consequences of their actions, it opens way for the culprit of this civil war. Sokovia Accords established by the United Nations. That treaty, aims to put each of the actions and missions of the Avengers in the hands of the United Nations for so, take care of each human life, taking into account that it will be them who decide if the heroes can act or not. As expected, not everyone agrees. They needed something for fight, here is their reason. After discussions, different thoughts, ideologies and equations, the decisions are made. 36 hours, two teams, a objective, an end, and Russo Brothers, Civil War has begun!I affirm with all security and respect that ""Civil War"" has the best sequences of action of Marvel films so far, with sophisticated and perfect choreographies and training. A true example, and personally one of the best parts of the movie, the fight at Berlin airport. The presentation of both sides, literally, made me cry, its class, its style, its elegance and its professionalism to mix and combine each of the specific abilities (physical and emotional) of the old and new heroes, to create a scene of entertainment, quality and long, long fight makes that truly the public continues to support to ""Marvel"" for continue, (Curious fact: Directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (""John Wick"") are part of the second unit of the film).""Spider-Man is the equivalent to Wonder Woman in Civil War""Special relevance has the presentation of Spider-man and Black Panther. Their inclusion is appropriate, the first is introduced in way more relaxed and comic, who along with his fight and jokes makes this be the best performance in the Peter Parker story.Another hero who had appointment was a Black Panther, an heir to the throne full of hatred and pain, perfect for his own movie and with a fresh and innovative appearance. In addition, other friends already seen previously are incorporate to the group as ""Ant-Man"", associating the world of past facts (seen in the films) with the present, something that really strengthens and gives coherence to the Marvel Universe. While many characters used this as a springboard for their own films (Spider Man - Black Panther), all boils down to the personal conflict revealed at the end between these three men, it is something that goes beyond policies, laws, treaties or rules, this is personal. Russo brothers take the decision after pleasing to the public with that magnificent fight, they there will be no more effects, flying planes, cobwebs, or CGI, for that moment, they weave meticulously a narrow path to focus on the three real protagonist of the story, Tony, Steve and Bucky.And then, arrive the final fight, ""Iron Man"" vs. ""Captain America"" a dispute of friends. The fact that Bucky was defeated and they could fight each other was really fantastic, this is not a trick more to win more money, it is the destiny. Personally, I felt like the final fight between Batman and Superman, that anger but at the same time love, that hate but at the same time forgiveness , it created a swirl of emotions and thoughts that ended in fatalism. ""CW"" had all the unimaginable, and even the enigmatic and traditional cameo appearance of Stan Lee.Phase three has begun. If Marvel offers us more equal or better products that this, will sound crazy but, they could reach the level and love of critics and fans to ""Star Wars"" . Goodbye to the cliché about Marvel films are cheap fiction and paste sh_t, quality exists. ""Civil War"" gives us a true contrast of ""BvS"", but is just as tasty, fruitful and exciting. ""CW"" is the best film of ""Marvel"" so far. It plants strong and resistant foundations to the future to come, leaving a hard and impossible work for Warner Bros. with ""Suicide Squad"" and Fox and Marvel (again) with ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" in May and ""Doctor Strange"" in November.… Expand            "

It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely.In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark.Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing.Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary.I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.… Expand            "

Now, I know I wasted characters listing the cast, but it was worth it, because this movie was amazing, and very surprising. The film goes through multiple flashback for the first 30 minutes of the film, it shows where Bucky was before The Winter Soldier, Bucky was being kept under ice just like finding Captain in ice, but Bucky was in a Russian controlled facility. It was great to know that they did a bit more backstory on Bucky because it was still hard to figure out how Bucky became The Winter Soldier. The main story can be somewhat compared to the comics, it had some elements from the comics which were great. The cast of this film was unbelievable, for a film with this many comic book characters in one whole movie, the cast really brought those characters off the pages and onto the Big Screen into Marvel Cinematic Universe, and those characters that have been brought back and first time being on screen like Black Panther, and Crossbones, while Ant-Man, War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Scarlet Witch and Sharon Carter have been brought back after being in previous film in the MCU. The Biggest surprise for me was Tom Holland who played Spider-Man, he knocked it out of the park as Spider-Man, he was even better than Andrew Garfield which was an even bigger surprise because I thought what can be worse than Andrew Garfield? I thought Holland was going to be even worse than Garfield, but now I realize that I was so wrong, I mean Holland was hilarious, funniest Spider-Man ever. The whole cast really was awesome, I'm really glad that in the end they set up the Black Panther movie and they teased the new Spider-Man movie.

So they finger pointed those events in this narration and that is one of the reasons for the Civil War to take place. Particularly disturbing the public and loss of many lives when these powerful men fighting the bad guys.

So does it make people who were whining about that be happy?I don't know, but as an entertaining film, it did everything it can give the best for the viewers.

But in terms the movie and plot. This movie had one of the best plots in the MCU... it's funny coming from a superhero movie. But I felt that the MCU's civil war was more about relationships with the heroes rather than the problems with the sokovia accords.Which is why I thought Antman and Spiderman are filler, although they were the spotlight towards both sides of the heroes. The only real reason they were there is to show off Spiderman, Giant Man and crack a few jokes from Tom Holland and Paul Rudd. There was NO reason to be there... I personally like them in the movie, but they served no purpose... end of story.I did like the relationships built towards superheros, examples are Vision/Wanda, Capt/Iron Man, and Capt/Bucky. For a 2 hour and a half movie, they did a good job focusing on each character... I just wish they did the same for Antman and Spiderman. And considering this was a Capt. America movie, The relationship between Capt/Bucky and Capt/Iron Man is going be much strong no doubt.I really like this movie, but because it was 2 1/2 hours long... there are stuff going to be lacking but I found myself entertained this so far has to be the best movie they've ever made in the MCU, and I cannot wait for how the Russo Brothers will execute Avengers: Infinity War… Expand            "

The formula is running dry, and whereas I bet it's great for kids and lower-intelligence individuals to have a franchise which specialises in the by-the-numbers narrative structure ALL MCU films follow (where story/action foreplay with no meaningful consequences add up to a blown out, OTT finale where nothing really meaningful happens, and then, a cliffhanger of sorts in the form of an open ending OR post-credits teaser) I, for one, am sick of it.Second of all, the characters, which have become so watered down and 'Disneyfied' I barely see them as their comic book counterparts. Only, truthfully, Stark + T'Challa come close, whereas others are just simplified, dumbed down instances of rushed studio output. Scarlet Witch is definitely interesting, but looks more like a member of the Runaways than that of Magneto's daughter (oh wait, wrong film franchise....) and is WAY underpowered considering her actual abilities.If I had to commend the film, I suppose the action is well co-ordinated. However, it does more than switch your brain off after a certain extent. Plus there is NO real tension when the two sides collide. Hell, they're not going to KILL each other are they? This is Disney after all!! No, we'll just get a few bruises and snide remarks between them, yeah, that'll do it. And no, Cap/Bucky vs Iron Man was nowhere as good as it should/could have been, an unwanted fallout from the previous no-stakes battle just witnessed.All in all, I feel like Marvel found a formula with Avengers Assemble and have elected to stick with it, considering the film's success.

Unlike the last Captain America, this is basically an Avengers movie with a central thread built around Cap and his bro Bucky. However, it is much, much better than the last Avengers was.The movie's downsides are its lack of focus; there is a balance between characters and storylines but they all go by really quickly. Also, like its competitor Batman v Superman, this movie is predicated on the odd conceit that the violence of the previous movies suddenly counts. Flipping the switch to suddenly have people care about death and mayhem is a bit awkward, as is the conflict in engenders, but if you're willing to go along for the ride, it's a fun ride.The movie's upsides include possibly the best superhero action Marvel has put out and some pretty intriguing character introductions. It seems a strange choice to introduce a new Spider-Man by shoehorning him into a movie with a boatload of less popular characters, but the new take on the character is refreshing, genuine, and funny. Finally, a kid playing a kid. Black Panther is slightly less exciting and is walking on ice a little bit, but I felt the character worked and would want to see his solo movie.The direction is slick, the mix of humor and action should appeal to most any audience, and the effects are great. But perhaps the biggest surprise (and maybe it shouldn't be) is that like the last movie in the series, this one really advances the continuity.

The Russo brothers deliver one of the best Marvel movies to date, easily standing up with the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Winter Soldier.  This has been everything that fans want in one place, the fight scenes are excellent, the plot is great, the dialogue is fantastic and it doesn’t spend too much time sequel baiting at all.  There are a ton of characters and they are all used to good extent and feel relevant and the Russo brothers not only do this well, but make it look like it’s easy and that’s a feat that has only been pulled off by Joss Weedon in the past.  If this is the team behind the Infinity War Movies, sign me up immediately because this film kicked ass.  I think some fans might be taken a bit aback by the fact that there is not as much of the Weedon-esque  humour in this film but it’s not entirely absent and feels like it has just the right amount in the movie.  If you are a fan of the Marvel films I would say check this one out, if you are not that really in to the Marvel films then prior to this you should at least watch all three of the Iron Man films, both of the Avengers films and all three of the Captain America films.  I know that is a lot but there are a lot of back story in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point and it is kind of necessary viewing at this point.this has been one of the best films of 2016 so far if not the best.… Expand            "
中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," 'Captain America: Civil War' is another winner from the Russo brothers, who also directed 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014) which is my favourite MCU movie of all time.The movie starts with an action scene that involves Captain'Captain America: Civil War' is another winner from the Russo brothers, who also directed 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014) which is my favourite MCU movie of all time.The movie starts with an action scene that involves Captain America (Chris Evans) leading the new team of Avengers which include; Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and The Falcon (Anthony Mackie). This intense action scene reminds me of the opening scenes in 'Casino Royale' (2006) and 'Skyfall' (2012), the fact that the Russo brothers would take a comic book property and adapt it into a spy, espionage thriller genre is absolutely intense and gripping.An accident occurs throughout this scene which costs the lives of many innocent people, that is when the government decide to take action. General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) informs the group that they must sign an accord which Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Vision (Paul Bettany) agree to do, but the captain doesn't think it's right to do so. He finds out that his old friend, Bucky aka ""The Winter Soldier"" (Sebastian Stan) has been committing some serious crimes and is wanted by the government.Steve tries everything he can to protect his old friend, and the conflict between Steve and Tony gets heated pretty fast.We also see some interesting characters getting introduced such as Black Panther (a very talented Chadwick Boseman), and Spider-Man (a very quirky Tom Holland) finally makes his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and, without spoiling too much...both Black Panther and Spidey are absolutely amazing in this movie. You will not be disappointed as to how they are written in.Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is even better in this movie than he was in his solo movie, he provides a lot of laughs, but at the same time, proves that he is more powerful and useful than we think.The best sequences in this movie are the chase scene between the Winter Soldier, Black Panther and Captain America...the fact that it escalates so quickly creates an even more intense moment. There is also the airport scene in which we see the fight between ""Team Iron Man"" and ""Team Captain America"" battle it out. Every hero is used to their full potential here, it's amazing that the Russo's are able to bring in a crowd of heroes and keep it focused. Bravo.Some may be concerned that this looks a little overstuffed, it isn't crowded and confused like 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' (2014), and strangely enough, this still feels like a ""Captain America"" movie, like it is a direct sequel to 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014).Even though it feels like a ""Captain America"" movie, you actually understand the two different points of view between Iron Man and Captain America, this is a more grounded movie, and you can find yourself sympathising with both characters and their motivations.The Russo brothers have crafted a grounded, hand-to-hand combat, stylish, thriller film. This makes me confident in the decision to give the Russo brothers ""Infinity War"" movies. Their approach to using characters at their very best, and not relying so much on CGI in favour of hand-to-hand combat sequences.The reason why this is a step below 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (2014) is because the villain, who is Zemo (Daniel Bruhl), is once again, an underused Marvel villain. He isn't memorable like; Obidiah Stane, Loki, Alexander Pierce and Ultron...but his role is very small to the point where it won't affect the overall movie. This is about a dispute between The Cap and Iron Man. Things get out of hand as the movie goes on. The stakes get higher and higher and I don't think any Marvel film will surpass the tension of this...The Russo brothers are truly a gift at Marvel!… Expand            "

Nonetheless, after 2015's  bland Avengers sequel I was a little apprehensive about the quality that would be presented in Civil War, these concerns were soon forgotten about.With the Russo Brothers at the helm, as expected, Civil War is essentially a hybrid of previous films; The Avengers and Winter Soldier. The action scenes are grounded in a contextual reality that is reminiscent of Winter Soldier but incorporates the ensemble cast with a fluidity similar to the Avengers Assemble. The finished product is an extremely well balanced action film that keeps your attention from beginning to end and considering this is Marvel's longest film to date, it achieves this with a certain sense of passivity.The film is proficient at preserving the relationships that it has established throughout it's predecessors while harmlessly introducing MCU newbies Black Panther and Spiderman. The casting of these two characters is impeccable and I eagerly await the solo films that will ensue.Any criticisms that arise throughout the film are of the nitpicking variety and  mostly consist of some convenient plot points and the occasional flat scene.Civil War justly deserves a seat in the higher echelons of the already over-saturated genre and the Russo Brothers have set the standard for all future Marvel films.… Expand            "

Is it a perfect movie? No, the existence of some characters were pointless, but that's all I can really say negative about the film.

中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," After the events of The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and the beginning of Civil War itself, the Avengers team find themselves under fire for their unchecked use of power and civilian casualties. As the team divides amongstAfter the events of The Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and the beginning of Civil War itself, the Avengers team find themselves under fire for their unchecked use of power and civilian casualties. As the team divides amongst itself on the best way to solve this problem, a malevolent force works to tear them apart from the inside out. Civil War is a great superhero movie that asks big questions and still has the heart of the first two Captain America movies. It is a worthy successor to the series.The Truth is Not RelativeThe most powerful scene in the movie comes at Peggy Carter’s funeral. Her niece Sharon Carter gives the eulogy and recounts a conversation she had with her aunt. Peggy told Sharon, “Compromise where you can. Where you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say ‘No, YOU move’.” Rarely has a comic book movie been more resonant to the times in which we live. The world is upside down and it’s screaming at us that wrong is right every single day. Peggy Carter’s message is a clarion call to us, we must plant ourselves in the truth, like a tree and not be shaken. It’s a clear picture of Psalm 1,“Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.” (Psalm 1 ESV)Steve Rogers is a wonderful model for this. His morality and virtue are not shaped my popular opinion or politics, but by something much more foundational and unchanging, knowing that there is right and wrong and that they are not something to be compromised.Freedom to ChooseThere is also another side to the coin. Captain America sees the inherent danger of taking choice away from the Avengers and making them pawns of a political body. He is fearful that they will be asked to stay out of situations they should be in and forced to act in ways they ought not because of prevailing political sentiment. There is a good correlation with the Jedi in the prequels, that allowed themselves to become agents of a government and not what is right. In the end the Jedi became compromised, realizing too late that they’ve been in service to the wrong master all along.The choice to do what is right cannot be left to a committee and popular opinion, Steve knows this and willingly lives out that principle. In fact, this is the very reason Steve is fighting for Bucky. Bucky is someone who has had choice forcibly removed, enslaved to the will of an evil organization and been made to do terrible things. He is a microcosm of the question facing the Avengers team. Captain America shows his quality once again as he interposes himself between Iron Man and the Winter Soldier, protecting both: Tony from acting on revenge and Bucky from something that is not his fault.ConclusionCaptain America: Civil War is a fantastic movie and honestly the Avengers movie we all hoped Age of Ultron would be. While I do have some minor quibbles, I feel Spider-man is shoehorned into the film and would have rather had his time devoted to other characters like Agent 13 or Black Panther, it does not detract too much from the enjoyment of the film.

Some guy flipped out about Marissa Tomei being Peter Parker's grandmother.... Yes, you read that correctly. Even though Peter says ""Aunt May"" that moron somehow thought it was his grandmother? Shows what kind of idiots are out there.Anyways, this movie was good. Action was great and stuck true to its predecessors' tone. Black Panther was super bad ass. The choreography for his fight scenes are freaking awesome and his suit could not have been cooler. The strife between Cap and Iron Man was done very well. The movie does a good job on why both sides feels so compelled for their side. Stark has a lot of guilt and Cap doesn't trust the government because he saw Hitler's rise to power.Zemo as a villain is also very interesting. He's not Loki, Ultron, Hydra or RedSkull. No powers or powerful organization. Just one man. One man who was able to turn a team of super-humans against one another. It just goes to show that the human mind is that much more powerful than super soldier serums, tech and radioactive spiders. Pull on those strings and bam. That's the real power here is his intellect.There are some things I'd say that don't make sense. Th killing of the Starks in the beginning seemed like such a simple job and not necessary for a secret black operative. Also, a random camera in the forest which I'm guessing is traffic camera for the benefit of the doubt, someone like Winter Soldier would make sure that was out before or picked a spot with no cameras.Scarlet Witch throwing the exploding Crossbones into a building is just stupid. Couldn't she have just thrown her straight up or done what she did with Vision and push him down into the ground? Was that just an oops?Airport battle. Great battle but not exactly ideal for Spiderman. They made it work overall but for him, open spaces aren't the greatest for his webbing and swinging.Overall, a good movie.

While it's competent, fairly well made in the expected style, and tries to deliver in the ever increasing more is more attitude for these things; it is also for the mostOkay this one is the tipping point for the whole superhero sub-genre.  While it's competent, fairly well made in the expected style, and tries to deliver in the ever increasing more is more attitude for these things; it is also for the most part a big silly overlong bore.  Fights and more fights are just boring!  Especially when the story is convoluted with way too many characters not to mention all the super powers.  That's the biggest problem with this movie, it simply has too many characters to juggle for the audience to truly get emotionally involved in any.  How many times can we witness big outlandish battles of superheroes, more superheroes, super villains, etc. and find something new?  The big money shots are nothing special anymore since CGI has become so sophisticated that anything and everything has been done on screen, or so it seems.The European settings are good, and there's a subtle reality to the filmmaking not apparent in a lot of these movies.  The tone is more adult than ""Avengers"" and this big superhero throw down feels more intelligent than the very similar face off of ""Batman v. Superman"", yet it is still silly as hell!  Though the acting isn't bad per se, I now despise every actor in this thing.  It's like the ultimate in club with them all playing outlandish pretend and laughing all the way to the bank after we surrender our wits and bucks to the nonsense.  Especially annoying are Paul Rudd's attempts at humor, Jeremy Renner's attempts at drama, Anthony Mackie's attempt at being Will Smith, and the way over it - be done with it Downey Jr. whose profession seems to now be playing Iron Man, not an actor.  Worst of all is the introduction of the yet again rebooted Spider-Man who truly now should be called Spider-boy.  He ain't no man in this, that's for sure.  Yes they make that point, but the unknown actor looks and sounds like Tobey Maguire (not a favorite, but he fit the role) which further confuses all the reboots for this once great comic book character now utterly destroyed by this juvenile, hammy, over-the-top played for all laughs re-introduction which in a sane world would be the death nail to that franchise.  Of course we're not in a sane world though.  And despite my reaction, some teenage girls were giggling at all the idiocy… so the money machine will continue of course.Also distracting were the needless cameos by actors we all know who are on screen too briefly to not serve as distraction.Final conclusion:  Marvel is over (in terms of their once original, clever, inventive and engaging storytelling) and so looks to be the whole superhero fad in cinema which began in the late seventies with the epic ""Superman"", furthering into phenomenon heights with the late eighties ""Batman"" and hitting its zenith in 2008 with the excellent ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"".  I actually liked the first ""Captain America"" in 2011 which was a solid origin story, (8 rating here).  Of course it will take years and dozens more big movies like this for audiences to wane.  That's the cycle, but I'm marking this as the turning point.Just the opinion today of a former kid comic book fan and lifelong movie disciple.… Expand            "

Writers Steven McFeely, Christopher Markus and Joe Simon along with the direction of the Russo Brothers have created an incredibly entertaining film.I initially had my concerns that it may feel contrived; as that was how I felt reading the comic it is based on. I can say that I am quite happy with how they handled it all. Every character has their moment to shine on the big screen. One of the other concerns I had was whether Cap would become lost in his own movie. I can also say that despite the large roster of characters it still feels like a Captain America film. Without giving spoilers the plot is largely driven by Cap's relationship with Bucky. Of course this implicates other characters along the way and provides tangible motivations for each character. This is most evident with Iron Man and new addition Black Panther.Black Panther as well as Spiderman are both introduced in an organic way that feels natural. It doesn't come across as ham-fisted or that they have been shoehorned in. Black Panther looks great on screen. His costume, accent and personality come across as regal which fits him perfectly. Spiderman is perhaps the best interpretation of the character we have seen yet. I couldn't help but smile seeing him in action.The standout set piece at the airport is perhaps not only the best super hero action scene; but one of the best action scenes yet. The scene itself evokes the full double page spreads in the comics. I was entertained throughout and the film managed to run the gamut of emotional investment. At its core, its central issue is about two very different ideologies. Yet it is able to also provide comedic moments of levity mixed in.A few of my criticisms would be that there is a bit of shaky cam in the first act of the film. The villain as is the case in many Marvel films isn't particularly great. Zemo and Crossbones have fairly limited screen time. However the bigger antagonists are the heroes themselves. The other criticism would be of the ending. (Don't worry no spoilers here). The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and I feel that it left me wanting more. I was so invested by that point that I would have liked to have seen a bit more. The biggest take away I had from seeing the film was questioning what is in store for; and the future of the Avengers now?Prior to seeing Civil War I think the Winter Soldier was my favorite Marvel film. I would say that as a film the Winter Soldier is the better movie. There were so many things I liked about Civil War though that it ultimately takes a close second. My opinion may change after a second viewing. In the end I think Civil War's parts are greater than the sum of those parts; but those parts are damned good.And now for a PSA: Be sure to stay through the credits for 2 post credit scenes.

It delivers all the thrilling action and humour we have come to expect from Marvel, while also showing us more human sides of the characters, showing that even popcorn flicks can be smart and mature. The film's only true shortcoming is the villain. He was a good villain in the comics, but here, he's just another one-dimensional MCU villain who can't reach the heights of Loki or Thanos. However, the movie makes up for this with the best on-screen depiction of Spider-Man since Tobey Maguire. Tom Holland's portrayal of the popular character is both funny and endearing, making me even more excited for his upcoming solo movie. In short, Captain America: Civil War is a smart, thrilling and overall satisfying superhero film, and one of the best MCU films.… Expand            "

While this isn’t the best Marvel movie featuring the Avengers' characters, it is an awesome and epic film from start to finish. The CGI was great and the fight scenes were fantastic. The fight in the airport between all of the characters was epic and stunning in every way and you can't help but marvel at the scene's magnificence. Another feature I liked about the film was that it seemed as the though the script was more mature and serious than some of the previous Avengers films. To be honest, I was getting tired of the constant humor and laid-back attitudes that were in the other films (e.g. Avengers 1) Civil War had humor, but the humor was in MUCH more appropriate places and wasn't so superfluous.However, this film is not without its flaws - though they are few.One big issue of mine was the fact that so many of the characters seemed very short-sighted and way too driven on emotion rather than reason. We've had so many movies building up to the fact that these characters are SUPERheroes who should be above succumbing to simple guilt/revenge emotions. But not just the superheroes, I'm also talking about the brain capacity of the civiliansExamples: The civilians who are mad at the Avengers claim they are angry because their loved ones were hit in the crossfire. But what would've happened if the Avengers HADN'T stepped in? This: humanity would be enslaved under either Loki or Shield/Hydra -- or worse, humanity would've been destroyed by Ultron Now it is true that Stark created Ultron, so the lady in the beginning's woes are somewhat substantiated - same with Zemo. But, in virtually every other situation, if the Avengers hadn't gotten involved, the planet would be in a MUCH worse condition. So to those who are angry at the Avengers for the loss of their loved ones: yes it sucks you lost loved ones in the crossfire, but guess what: the alternative ending to those situations would've been much worse had the Avenger not been there! Why could the writers not understand this simple fact?My next example is Stark at the end: Stark, you're supposed to be a SUPER hero. Yeah, that sucks that Bucky killed your parents, but how the **** is killing Bucky - who you KNOW had his head ****ed with - going to satisfy your revenge? You know damn well it was all Hydra's doing, so why take it out on Bucky? Hell, Stark even says ""I don't care"" when Cap explains the experiments that Hydra conducted on Bucky. Like wtf?? How the **** are you supposed to convince me you're fighting for a noble cause when your actions lack any solid reasoning and are purely fueled by the revenge emotion? ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU IGNORE FACTS THAT PROVE YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE FEELING REVENGE!My next problem is Cap and Bucky: WHY THE **** DIDN'T YOU TELL EVERYONE THAT BUCKY WASN'T THE ASSASSIN THE SECOND YOU GUYS GOT ARRESTED?? Yeah, they might not have believed you, but the key word is MIGHT. And furthermore, when has CAPTAIN AMERICA ever exhibited qualities of that of a repetitive liar?? So if Cap were to make the unexpected claim that Bucky was innocent of the bombing, there is a good chance that he would've been believed. BOTH Cap and Bucky waited insanely long to tell the others that Bucky was innocent of the Vienna bombing and it drove me nuts.Another problem: The ending fight ends rather abruptly with a weak resolution or end to any major dilemma -- Bucky still lives, and now iron man doesn't have a suit... its like: ""Was that all the fight was about?"" Because if so, it seems that the motivation for the fight was weak to begin with - what the hell was even achieved during that ending fight? What dilemma was resolved? Just a good amount of punches and suddenly everyone is ok with each other? The fact that it was only to save/kill Bucky made the fight seem a bit shallow as a whole. However, I guess you could argue that this fight symbolizes Cap's parting from the official Avengers as he leaves Tony and drops his shield.My last issue with the film is my biggest one:To be clear, Zemo's objective was to kill the Avengers to quench his thirst for revenge, but in the end he only gets TWO OF THE AVENGERS TO FOLLOW HIM. Did he forget about all of the other Avengers like Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, Vision, and scarlet witch?? Even if Cap and Iron man died- what about the others??? Hawkeye, Falcon, and Scarlet witch are all locked up and can't go anywhere. Not to mention the fact that no one knows where Thor and Hulk are. So how are you supposed to kill them? Heck, WAS Zemo even planning to kill the others? Since Zemo was about to commit suicide in the end, it's evident he was satisfied with only Cap and Iron Man's death, which hardly makes sense considering THERE WERE MULTIPLE AVENGERS IN SOKOVIA. So why is he satisfied with only the deaths of Cap and Iron Man?Even though the film had some annoying and easily avoidable inconsistencies and problems, it was still a kickass film. I really enjoyed the film overall. 4/5 would recommend.… Expand            "

The plot develops very well as the movie deals with a lot of rather serious issues for a comic book adaptation and tackles a detail that I never fully stopped to consider before: the collateral damage and after-effects of all-out war. The public image of The Avengers is questioned heavily as the world attempts to have some say in how superhumans operate and serve in the defense of mankind. It's these much more mature themes that lend a lot of quality to Civil War. Equally impressive is the director's ability to have so much star power/super heroes on screen at once and never feel like any of it's over-gratuitous. It all makes for a great blend of action, fun and story development. While Chris Evans' Captain America is meant to be the primary focus in this adventure, it's the multitude of other characters that really help this movie shine brighter than even The Winter Soldier. Marvel/Disney have yet another winning movie adaptation on its hands and leaves a lot to be excited about over the eventual Avengers 3 two-part, sort-of finale to this part of the Marvel universe (at least, the assumed end as Disney/Marvel haven't signed the main actors beyond the next Avengers movie).… Expand            "

The Russo Brothers use to know what to do but I'm thinking the studio or producers took control or these guys have really lost it. The acting was the only thing that saved the film - though I lost a bit of respect for most of the actors for selling out (yes, they are crying all the way to the bank). Robert Downey Jr. use to be able to act, his one dimensional character was the most cliche because he was overacting most of the time. The first act is probably the worst, it was all over the map with political statements and cliche dialogue. It was like they took the headlines in mass media today and put them in a blender and then stuck them in this movie. I am more than disappointed, I feel downright cheated. The critics should be ashamed for their high reviews. This is one more nail in the Marvel coffin before we all stop going. After this movie you can forget me going to X-men.

中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," Straight off the bat Captain America Civil War is worth the hype,it's dark,grounded,action packed,emotional and very fun.First off the Russo brothers,these guys have to be praised because of they way how they handled each and everyStraight off the bat Captain America Civil War is worth the hype,it's dark,grounded,action packed,emotional and very fun.First off the Russo brothers,these guys have to be praised because of they way how they handled each and every character in this film no matter how much of a big or small role they had everyone fit perfectly,because not only was this a Captain America sequel but this felt like an Avengers sequel as well,and the film is just handled perfectly.So this movie starts off there winter soldier and Age of ultron picks off with the Avengers team still being intact and doing their missions then as the movie goes by you start to see that the Avengers aren't so perfect as events from the first Avengers movie,Age of Ultron,Winter Soldier and Civil War it's self,reveal that people have died during these Avenger encounters and it was really never touched upon in past movies as they made it seem the Avengers saved everything and everyone with no added consequences and this is one of the things the movie does well in exploring what has happened in the past to determine everyones motivation in the film and thus the world starts to question the Avengers' methods and the civil war between the Avengers begins.What really impressed me was how solid everyones reason for being on either team Captain America(against the government) or team Iron Man(with the government) was,and what I found amazing was how no team was villainized as both sides remained neutral and the decision was really left to the audience as both sides were correct and again the points and reasoning for each side is spot on(well done again Russo Brothers).Now there are some new characters in the movie namely Black Panther and Spiderman.Chadwick Boseman nails it as T'Challa/Black Panther as he has his own agenda in the film and he is just epic as you follow him and his story throughout the movie as he is one of the best things in the movie because he was so different from any other superhero we've met before.Spiderman,man Tom Holland's performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman is just amazing and you enjoy seeing him for every minute in the movie from start to finish and I definitely can't wait to see more of Spiderman in the future.Baron Zemo is the villain in Civil War,before I saw this movie I questioned whether this film needed a villain,but Baron proved to be a good villain with good motivations.What I also found surprising is how grounded the villain was as he wasn't overblown or overcomplicated,he was just a regular guy who was against the Avengers for a justifiable reason.The Action in this movie is wonderful as Captain America:Winter Soldier had some of the best Action sequences in the MCU and I proudly say that Civil War has better,more epic and bigger action than any other comic book movie.The Airport fight scene is just incredible it's fun and heavily entertaining and it's not that one fight scene alone that's done so well as Civil War has great balance with action sequences and character interactions and with all the Avengers including Antman,Black Panther and Spiderman,Civil War is a great visual feast.The Balance of tone is near perfection as the movie is dark and grounded in some scenes,then just shifts to a light and fun tone with some humor as you laugh multiple times in the film and when the movie needed to be emotional and dramatic the Russo brothers made it that way.Since this is a Captain America film,the focus always goes back to Steve and his journey after Winter Soldier and his relationship with Bucky/Winter Soldier.Their relationship is also one of the strong points in this movie as Captain America never gives up of his friend Bucky and their relationship is tested in many ways in the movie.Sharon from Winter Soldier is back and plays as Steve Rogers' love interest which was a welcome surprise too and Sharon also has something to do other than being a love interest too.Now the movie isn't perfect(but it's really close),the Ironman introduction into Civil War at the beginning of the movie was a bit sluggish and although Baron Zemo was a good villain,but his end game at the near end of the film is a bit lacking and somewhat plot-device- ish as he makes the Avengers come into quarrel and you just find Zemo's methods questionable in order to move the movie along.So at it Captain America Civil War is a film about friendship and family which comes with the struggles of it,one thing I have to point out without giving too much away is that the friendship message is wonderful crafted in the third act and in my opinion that's were the ""Civil War"" begins as the tag lines suggested in the posters and trailers ""United We Stand,Divided We Fall"", and this message is conveyed beautiful in the movie along with some epic action,fun moments combined with some emotional moments too.A great movie and definitely one of the best Comic book movies ever made.Can't wait for Avengers Infinity War.… Expand            "

The movie has it's flaws, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. I don't know about you, but the Captain America series are the only movies in the MCU that actually get better with it's squeals. The action, the effect's, the humor, the characters, and it's stunt work has improved from the first movie.What this movie dose so well is that it's really hard to pick a side, because both sides have a very good reason to be at each others throats. One minute I'm rooting for Tony, and the next I'm rooting for Cap. It's conflict like this that I couldn't decide for myself on who side I was on or who was right, but that's just the fun of it.Tom Holland as Spider-Man might be one of the best adaption of the character that we've had. Sony studios has made over five Spider-Man movies and the two actors who played Spider-Man (Maguire and Garfield), did their very best of what their got, but didn't quite capture the character that we know and love. But the Spider-Man in this movie has a screen time of 30 minutes or more, and Holland managed to capture the character so perfectly that it makes Sony studios look lousy. He was excellent in the role and I would go as far to say that he was a billion times better than Maguire and Garfield (In my opinion). I can't wait to see more of him in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" that's out next year.Speaking of good casting - Chadwick Boseman was pretty damn awesome as Black Panther. Boseman can basically play anything and I'm not kidding you when I say that, as he played Jackie Robinson, James Brown, and now Black Panther. Chadwick Boseman has some crazy talent and him as Black Panther was spot on casting. I'm looking forward to seeing his solo film coming out in 2018.If you thought the stunt work in ""Winter Soldier"" was outstanding, then wait until you see the stunt work in this movie, as it was just....INCREDIBLE! All the heavy praise belongs to the stunt team for doing the impossible.Now for the problems: Daniel Brühl is a boring villain. I honestly can't remember much about his character in the movie and that's because he was pretty forgettable. That came across a bit too harsh didn't it? It really sucks for me to say that, because Daniel Brühl is great actor and sometimes he can be the saving grace for a movie that's either good or bad. He wasn't awful or anything like that, it's just that I didn't find him treating at all.Martin Freeman is a great actor and I'm glad he's getting more meaty roles, but he doesn't do anything special or interesting in this movie. Yes, I know his character is probably going to developed more in the next movies, but my problem here is that he really felt out of place in this movie. At times the movie itself completely forgets about him, so every time he popped back up on screen I was like ""Oh, Martin Freeman is in this movie, I totally forgot about that"". But that's just me.The story was a bit meh and there was a little bit too much quick cut edits in the fight scenes that I couldn't get all that infested with. Now don't get me wrong, I like the airport fight and the Iron Man V Cap fight, because those scenes didn't have stupid quick cuts and I could easily see whats happening. I think it's the hand-to-hand combat fights that are too cutter for me to see what's going on. That's just my opinion.Overall: ""Captain America: Civil War"" lives up to the hype of being a great superhero movie and being a good movie on it's own. Marvel is having a great track record thus far- with the box office success, great reviews, and many upcoming spin offs. Civil War is most likely going to win every fanboys heart and it's not hard to see why.… Expand            "

For one, Tony Stark defends heroes should be controlled/monitored by the government, and that's fine but it prevents these ""vigilantes"" from having the rights to choose, and that could be deadly if they don't have much space to stop ""the bad guys"". On the other hand, Steve thinks they have the right to choose what they do. The conversations we have about these two themes never get repetitive and it builds up the conflict between Stark and Rogers just fine. Those two were never best buddies, despite Stark's ""So was I [your friend]"" assertion. They were also measuring d*cks back in 2012's The Avengers.- Once again, the Russos Brothers nailed the action and visual panache that made ""Winter Soldier"" so robust. The best action in the film includes a 15-min battle in an airport, when heroes go toe-to-toe.- Crammed the characters excellently. The movie never felt, for a minute, overloaded or messy. The conflict was streamlined enough to make the movie more focused than ""Age of Ultron"" ever did. Additions like Black Panther were a nice touch, and allowed for some nerdgasm moments.- Spidey!! Despite only a half hour of screentime, his presence was the thing I was most excited about this movie. And it surely paid off. Tom Holland so far nails the character, and Marisa Toomey as Aunt May is good too, even if the actress is a little bit young for the role. And just seeing Spider-Man fight Bucky, Falcon, Ant-Man and Cap himself was a joy I never thought I would experience in a live-action movie. For those who haven't seen this movie yet, be sure to stick around after the credits (not mid-scene, AFTER) to see a special tidbit that happens to Peter.CONS:- Weak villain. His plan is ultimately disappointing, and the backstory as to why he becomes so dangerously mad is half-baked.- Third act. Very disappointing.Overall, the third Captain America adventure fulfills its promise and delivers blend of drama, comedy and action. It features old and new characters, and most important, it is not overstuffed and is surely an exciting, well-directed and acted piece of gem worth watching.Score: 8.5/10… Expand            "
中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," The newest installment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that kick-starts the Phase Three movies with a very big shoe to fill because this movie is pretty damn amazing. I’m going to do my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possibleThe newest installment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe that kick-starts the Phase Three movies with a very big shoe to fill because this movie is pretty damn amazing. I’m going to do my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible because there are quite a few twists. For that reason I’m not going to actually give detail on the story because a lot of it DOES rely on spoilers.That said, I will give my thoughts on the story, and those say that the story flows very well. I know that some critics and reviewers thought that the beginning was a little too slow and they pushed the morality questions a little too much, but I completely disagree. The story moved with a good pace in a very understandable way and I was thoroughly engaged in it just as much as I was with everything else. I found it difficult to find plot holes in the film after watching it and I wasn’t bored for a moment. As always there are mid-credit and after-credit scenes. Not sharing what they are because spoilers but they are wonderful teasers and one a possible plot point in a future movie.The film features not one main super character, not six or even seven, but TWELVE of Marvel’s biggest name heroes in, as you’d guess, an all out Civil War. On one side of the conflict you have Iron Man, War Machine, Black Panther, Black Widow, Vision and Spider-Man (Not a spoiler since he was revealed by the trailer). On the other side you have Captain America, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Ant-Man. Surprisingly every single one is actually given a fair amount of screen time. No character is overlooked and they all stick to the personalities we’ve come to know and love them as. Special mention goes to Panther and Spider-Man both making their debut appearances in this film and both having their characters done perfectly. I was absolutely sold on both of these heroes from this film alone and now I’m eager to see their own movies.Of course, being a movie with “war” in the title, it’s got to have action in it, and this movie delivers in a massive way. These are without a doubt the best action sequences Marvel has ever put out, and not just because there are a lot of characters involved. The Russo brothers took their time to ensure that every single character fights exactly as you’d expect them to based on who they are and how they became these super-powered characters. The choreography, style and actions are all brilliantly done to emphasize the individual fighters rather than just using some bland one-size-fits-all fighting. And it’s not just fighting as the action. There are several chase scenes throughout the film that keep your heart pumping, again emphasizing on each individual’s strengths and weaknesses in the best way possible.The effects are just great. Of course there are things here and there that are obviously CGI, but for the majority of the film, I can’t tell what is CG and what is practical effects. However, there is a glaring issue with one specific set of CGI, and that is from the captions. For some reason Marvel thought that its entire audience has gone blind between this movie and Ant-Man and decided to make the caption of each location HUGE, WHITE, ALLCAPPED LETTERS that were plastered over the entire screen. Why they did this, I will never know, but it is the only time I was completely distracted from the rest of the film as it was painfully distracting.Captain America: Civil War was absolutely amazing. It didn’t take any of the twists or turns that I was expecting, but that just made it all the more engaging for those that I didn’t expect. Aside from the mentioned caption problem, I can only nitpick to find problems with this film. If you like heroes, if you like drama, if you like story, if you like good characters, if you like action, if you like any of those and don’t mind the rest, then GO SEE THIS MOVIE as soon as you can.Side note: I didn’t see the film in 3D, I only saw it in 2D.

It has great action sequences; great stunt work; and a great cast! Every superhero is perfect. Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show, but Ant-Man is sure to charm you silly. I realize some people have issues with the plot, specifically what starts the civil war in the first place. The way I look at it is this: the reason for the civil war is just an excuse to get the Avengers fighting with each other. Yes, there are plot holes and things that may not make sense; but you just got to overlook that and enjoy the heart of the movie. Heck, logically speaking, the Avengers could have avoided the whole war altogether, but what kind of movie would that be?There is one flaw to this movie, and I think it's a big one: the new villain. He's just some guy with an understandable hatred for the Avengers. However, his reason for his hatred is unoriginal and thus uninteresting to me. Marvel Studios just seem to have trouble creating and maintaining compelling villains in most of their movies which seems bizarre since they have a wealth of super villains to choose from. If you're going to have superheros, you might as well have at least one super villain, right?… Expand            "

The Russos have yet again crafted one of the most compelling films out of a moral and emotional conflict which builds from previous films in the MCU.Each character stands on their own, with each of them getting ample screen time. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland stand out from the rest as Black Panther and the new Spider Man respectively. (We have found our Spider Man finally!)The action scenes are an upgrade from The Winter Soldier, and are worth the price of admission (That airport sequence is unbelievable). Everyone pretty much kicks all kinds of ass, even though it's against each other.The humour is done superbly, didn't feel out of place and added that much fun into the film. Obviously Spider Man will definitely get the honourable title of having the funniest moments (Which isn't exactly surprising, but man it's so awesome).The story may not have had the same effect as it's comic book counterpart, however it made sense to follow in this direction considering the past consequences from previous films.Daniel Bruhl's Helmut Zemo was quite not the original character. More manipulative rather than the scientific mind with expert hand-to-hand combat skills. It was certainly the darkest Marvel villain yet and certainly leaves the film with some kind of damage against the Avengers, however he was overshadowed by the ongoing Civil War plot line. Much more manipulative than previous villains in the MCU, however he still falls to the ongoing problem of not memorable villains.Overall, this is perhaps the greatest film by Marvel yet. As a team-up film, definitely the best, however as a Captain America film, it falls short to The Winter Soldier. Definitely a must-watch.… Expand            "

Ultimately, a dozen Marvel universe superheroes duke it out, using their assorted powers to keep it interesting. At 146 minutes, it's too long: the dialogue often drags and every action scene (although edited with dizzying velocity) runs longer than necessary. In its favor are some expectedly neat special effects and a likeable cast. Each member gets to create a few moments of character (esp. the new Spidey delightfully played by Tom Holland).

Captain America: Civil War is a strange movie to me. There were a few parts that I liked, but there were also many parts that I felt were out of place when trying to understand the scope of the film. The story is meant to be about the consequences of superheroes and their actions, but the movie shifts away from that in favor of a story focused on Bucky/The Winter Soldier (late spoiler).One of the positives about the film is that the setup for it was really nice. The problem is that a lot of what occurred was quite illogical, reducing the effects of the thought provoking elements present in the story. For the most part, Tony Star/Iron Man felt out of character in accepting Pro-Registration when he was so highly suspicious of SHIELD during The Avengers. The Scarlet Witch accidentally killing some people was a nice setup in trying to make the Superheroes accountable, but in practicality, their suggestion would have never worked. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers never actually sit down to properly discuss it, which would have reduced the action, but would have ultimately made the story more interesting. For example, Tony bringing up how his own reckless actions have led to the creation of multiple supervillains while Steve could bring up his examples of Hydra taking over SHIELD and being part of the powerful regulating group.The fight choreography was very good too. We see some nice interactions between the characters both in and out of fight scenes. However, the emphasis on the action rather than the story sometimes leads to major problems like the ones that were present in Batman Versus Superman. It is not as bad in Captain America: Civil War, but some of the same elements could be seen.Ultimately, there was too little time for the movie as it tried to do too much. The introduction of Spider-Man felt strangely out of place as Tony turned to him in order to get help for his faction. The same applied to Hawkeye as he was pulled out of retirement from out of nowhere. It felt like the debate between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark as to which side is right could have been one movie and Steve Rogers trying to track down the Bucky could have been another.… Expand            "
中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," -Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain-Captain America: Civil War is a 2016 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger and 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast that includes Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Rudd, Emily VanCamp, Tom Holland, Frank Grillo, William Hurt and Daniel Brühl. In Captain America: Civil War, one year after the events of The Avengers: Age of Ultron, an act regulating superhuman activity fractures the Avengers into opposing factions, one led by Steve Rogers and another by Tony Stark.-Development of Civil War started in late 2013 when Markus and McFeely began writing the screenplay, which borrows concepts from the 2006 comic book storyline Civil War. The Russo brothers were brought back to direct in early 2014 after positive reactions to test screenings of The Winter Soldier. The film's title was revealed in October 2014 and Downey was added to the cast, with additional cast members joining the film in the following months. The film began principal photography in April 2015 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia and the Metro Atlanta area, before concluding in Germany in August 2015.--Critical response-The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 94% approval rating based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 81 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".-Justin Chang of Variety called it ""the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe."" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, ""Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth - the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees."" Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, ""This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything - and all - it wants to be."" Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, ""a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty.--Future-According to Feige, Civil War is the conclusion of the Captain America trilogy that began with The FirstAvenger. While it is the final standalone Captain America film in Evans' contract with Marvel Studios, Evans stated in September 2015 that he was open to extending his contract past the two-part Avengers: Infinity War, the final films on his contract at the time.… Expand            "

中国机长,captain-america-civil-war,,2016,2019," Short, alliterative review: boring with brief bouts of brilliance.Longer review:As always in “Cap” films, we get a lot of exposition, a little bit of action, and a furthering of plot points for upcoming movies.  It is very hard not toShort, alliterative review: boring with brief bouts of brilliance.Longer review:As always in “Cap” films, we get a lot of exposition, a little bit of action, and a furthering of plot points for upcoming movies.  It is very hard not to get the sense that a number of things are being set up here, but when is that not the case with Captain America movies (or Thor movies for that matter)? So this is my one bit of advice for any viewers – you are going to watch a piece in a larger whole, so if you are cool with that, please proceed with the continuation of MCU Phase 3.There isn’t anything really WRONG with CA:CW, but there is not a lot that is really RIGHT, either.  The plot is well-designed and well-paced (and hidden in the right places), but it isn’t all that exciting or plausible when you get down to it.  The divisions and fractures in the Avenger’s team dynamic make sense, but outside of Cap and Tony, there isn’t a real sense of antagonism anywhere else.  And let’s go ahead and double-down on that statement since Thor and Hulk aren’t around to beat each other up again.And speaking of beating each other up, the fight choreography is OUTSTANDING, and darn near feels like the culmination of 50 years of wuxia.  The special effects are also very good, and subtle in a way which Zack Snyder should pay attention to.  The acting is plausible, and the humor is well-placed, though sparse.  If anything, I would have liked to see more of Ant-man and Spiderman…both were a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stultifying room in my mind.In the end, it is an OK film, but more than a little boring.  It is definitely a worthwhile diversion, but definitely not “the greatest superhero trilogy of all time” (Cinemablend), “the most mature and substantive picture to have yet emerged from the Marvel Cinematic Universe” (Variety), or anything along those lines.  It is simply another superhero movie.With that being said, what follows is a general statement on the state of the MCU / DCCU (other than Cap’s recent adventure).In comics terms, I think we have already passed the “golden age” and moved into the “silver age.”  I liken this to the “golden age” of comics (30s-50s) where the idea of a superhero was developed and we received the big fellas/ladies – Superman, Batman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, etc.  For my money, the “golden” cinematic analog would be: the first two Spiderman movies (what motivates a hero), Nolan’s Batman trilogy (who deserves heroism), the first two X-Men movies (rejecting the hero), the original Avengers (teams of heroes), and maybe The Guardians of the Galaxy (why not move them beyond Earth and get a little cheeky while we’re at it).I think we are way beyond that now.  The movies are well-made, but we are seriously in re-tread territory.  Where we used to get treated to character introductions and serious questions, we are now squarely in the phase of world-building, mega-arc plot advancement, and revenue grabs.  This is fine for those who are truly interested in the larger story and character universes, but unnecessary for those of us who are not completists.  I liken this phase to the “silver age” of comics (60s-70s) where we received an explosion of characters, abilities, and plotlines, but not a lot that was really, really new from a literary or philosophical perspective.My guess is that we will continue to be treated to new characters in stand-alone roles, and that will be fine as long as it is done in a creative way (Ant-Man, Deadpool, etc.).  The rest of it should be expected by now: all Captain America films will be exposition for Avengers movies, all Thor movies are going to explain why/how the Infinity Stones come to be relevant, and the next Avenger story is going to take 5 hours to tell for some reason, etc..  And then there are the TV shows – tons and tons and tons of TV shows, each adding a little nugget to otherwise crowded mine.As for DC, I suspect they have missed the boat.  All the key questions have been answered, so they are pretty much forced to go “dark” (Suicide Squad, Vs.) or “historical” (WW), or maybe a bit of both.  Unfortunately, both have already been done, so they better bring some serious heat.  Otherwise, I think it might be time to move on……except for Guardians of the Galaxy 2, because that looks awesome.  And Dr. Strange, because that looks like a mashup of Inception and Batman Begins.  And the Inhumans…because…the Inhumans!  Oh – who am I kidding?  I’ll watch them all.  I just need Marvel (and DC) to deal the interest-factor back up past 5 again.… Expand            "

The movie's execution of its themes is infantile, and the plot is just a gaudy mess.The film adaptation is but the hollowest shadow of the source material it borrows (very, very loosely) from. The comic book was a very contemplative read, both Cap and Iron Man's ideologies were both represented clearly, neither was faultless and both had some very understandable human rationale behind them.The comic book almost serves as a deconstruction of the mainstream perspective on the super hero genre: glorified cartoony violence where the real world consequences are tossed to the side, worlds of bright colors and childish comprehensions of morality.In the Civil War COMIC the consequences have a very real effect on the Marvel Universe. Heroes die, Tony and Cap do some things their not proud of, the wider world of non-powered civilians and the government tie in with the scenario appropriately.But not here, not in this pretentious film.Two many extraneous elements are shoved into the movie. A new Spider-Man, serving as an attractive lure for more ticket sales, denied the proper attention his character deserved. Ant-man is torn from his obligatory solo movie and dropped here. The beginning of an obligatory Vision/Scarlet Witch romance is awkward, unexplained and out of place. Hawkeye is reintroduced, as is another forgettable and obligatory Marvel Villain. Black Panther, self-explanatory.The Marvel brand of comedy is here in spades, detracting from the very serious ideological conflict at hand.That grand ideological battle itself is built on a cheap foundation.In the MCU, Tony and Steve's relationship was never cemented firmly. Hardly was Steve and Bucky's relationship. Why should I care what these people do to each other.There was no weight to the conflict and its finale rang dry. For all the rising tension, only B-rate character War-machine is left scarred, and why should any one care, no one knows who he is, relegated to the backdrop of the MCU an obligatory sidekick for Iron Man.What really irks me about the MCU is that the world is terribly inconsistent. Marvel tries to be both charming and 'funny', while simultaneously attempting to juggle heavier thematic content. The Daredevil Netflix show, with its more grounded take, does not belong in this web of obligatory kid's films. You can't have a supposed 'political thriller' like the CA: Winter Soldier exist in the same universe where Iron Man invites his gang of good-guys to shawarma after NY has been ravaged by God-danged aliens.What irks me about all the pseudo YouTube critics and the brainless fanboys is that if they were to be approached with the question: ""Are comic books for kids?"" they would almost unhesitatingly answer with a conviction-less 'yes'.If that is the case, why all the absurd hate towards Batman v Superman.

Every building block in this movie is well constructed, with each scene meticulously crafted. The Russo's sure know how to make a movie, and this is just as by-the-book as Winter Soldier, but with even more heart.To me, this is because it strikes a great balance in tone between fun, and gritty emotion. In fact, this really will tug at your heart strings, especially in that heart-breaking final battle. I was close to tears at points, and a shout-out goes to the 2 leads on that one: both these characters were played spectacularly.So it's definitely emotional, but as I said, it's also huge fun. That's mainly thanks to some fun new character introductions like Ant-Man, and the amazing new Peter Parker (not to mention how astounding Chadwick Boseman was as Black Panther.) Getting down to it though; this movie was really enjoyable, emotionally gripping and downright moving. Roll on Phase 3.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It's still not quite the character focused stuff of Whedon, and it's not the thematic thriller that The Winter Soldier was. I did find myself confused at points too, which is largely thanks to the fact that some of the character's arcs weren't developed enough to truly understand the sides they chose (principally with Vision and Hawkeye,) and because the plot is a little choppy and confusing (perhaps it's second-viewing type stuff if you want to fully digest it.)VERDICT: A movie experience with laughs and tears a-plenty. This is heart-wrenching stuff, and another undeniable hit from Marvel and the Russos… Expand            "

Or the ones who blame me for being a victim?''''So, you did justice by your own hand?You confronted your abuser and took revenge.''''Revenge may seem normal to most people.But those of us who have suffered. Are we the ones who are wrong?This dialogue from the final act of this movie was perhaps the one that got me thinking a lot.Bullying is a recurring theme in film, but the approaches rarely show the complete fracture of the person who is being abused.A mental and social fracture that ends up turning them into perpetual victims by committing a crime when they finally explode.And many times we say: Why was nothing done to stop this situation? Why didn't they help them?And sadly, by the time the ""grown-up"" people want to help, it's already too late.A vicious cycle that repeats itself constantly. Better Days is not a subtle movie on the subject, but sometimes it's necessary to hit the audience in a certain way so that they somehow decide to tackle the issue themselves.This is a tough, sad and uncomfortable movie, but up to a point it's hopeful. And considering its theme and how events unfold, I could never argue that it offers a happy ending, but somehow the ending offers a look that allows you to believe that there will be a change, and someone will get the help the main character just didn't get from the people who were supposed to protect her.This scene takes place in the middle of the credits, so if you end up watching this movie, watch them.I loved when a movie leaves me with things to think about after watching them, and Better Days did that extensively.Highly recommended.… Expand            "

However, the picture grows decidedly stronger as it progresses, delivering a number of intriguing twists and turns as the protagonist and her punkish but chivalrous protector become embroiled in a gruesome murder mystery. In the end, the picture is a telling indictment of a system that claims to care about the well-being of its school age youth but that ultimately fails to provide the proper protection when needed -- that is, until enough attention is focused on the issue that it can't help but spark much-needed reforms, a potent cautionary tale for us all.… Expand            "

叶问4：完结篇,ip-man-4-the-finale,,2019,2019," I have a been a huge fan of the Ip Man series ever since the first movie came out in 2008. I watched all of the films in the series including the spinoff “Master Z: Ip Man legacy”. So, of course, I was going to go see this movie as well,I have a been a huge fan of the Ip Man series ever since the first movie came out in 2008. I watched all of the films in the series including the spinoff “Master Z: Ip Man legacy”. So, of course, I was going to go see this movie as well, especially considering its the last one in the main Ip Man films. Unfortunately, I came out feeling very disappointed in this movie.Let’s start with the positives. The first and probably the reason most people come to watch this film is the fight scenes. They are still very well choreographed and this iteration features a variety of different type of martial arts including western Karate. Seeing how they choreographed different fighting styles. The fighting is also fast-paced and stylistic. The second has to be Donnie Yen’s marvellous performance as the titular character Ip Man. He continues to embody the character perfectly and give a convincing dialogue as a man with many wisdom. Likewise, I also have to praise Wu Yue as Wan Zong-Hua (chairman of the Chinese Benevolent Association) for providing a contrasting character to Ip Man belief but still give that aura of wisdom. Danny Chan returns as Bruce Lee from Ip Man 3 and he is still great and resembles him. The score from Kenji Kawai returns and is also still really good at elevating every scene albeit it is still kinda similar to that of all the previous entries.Now let’s get to all the negatives from this film. Firstly, while I did praise the fights and its choreography; it’s not very memorable. Each film tends to have one or multiple fights that stick in your mind: The first film had the fight against 10 Japanese karate fighters, the second with the fish market fight and the table fight and the fight against the boxer, the third film with the fight against Mike Tyson and the final fight. However, the fights in this film don’t come close to the memorable fights of previous films. The closest it gets is maybe the Ip man vs Wan Zong-Hua or the Ip Man vs Scott Adkins (can’t even remember his character’s name…). Even those fights feel short and underwhelming at points. Secondly, why is every character in this film also borderline cartooney? There have been some over the top characters in previous entries but it was usually just one for comic relief but in this film, it feels like apart from the three characters I listed above; everyone else is over the top. This blend of serious performances from some actors with the over the top from others is very jarring. For example, Scott Adkins plays this over the top racist general but he is so blatantly racist and acts like a stereotypical general that it makes you wonder how he was even employed. Thirdly, the story is atrocious and lacks any nuance or depth. The story is simply Ip Man goes to America to get his son a school there and some weird racist stuff happens with Bruce Lee doing just kind of being there. The message in this film is, of course, exploring racism and they do kind of try to make it subtle with Bruce Lee who trains western people despite criticism from the Chinese people. HOWEVER, they waste Bruce Lee in this film by not even remotely having him involved in the main plot! He could have been used to show that it was possible for acknowledgement between Chinese and western people but they don’t even utilise this. Instead, we got over the top racist people trying to get rid of all Chinese people and prove Kung fu sucks so Ip Man has to stop him and convince some people otherwise. Due to them not utilising Bruce Lee more, the message of this film ends up feeling like western people are racist and bad even though this contrast Bruce Lee and even Ip Man point within this film. It doesn’t feel like a necessary story to tell for Ip Man with only a couple of things adding to his character like cancer and filming his training I guess? Also, this racist thing has already been done in Ip Man 2 so it is weird they are doing it again even if it explored slightly better. It just feels like similar ground and too much of a retread. Additionally, they decide to up the melodrama with all these family drama that really feels like they were trying to force some kind of character development. Overall, this film is a disappointing entry with its huge waste of story potential. However, the movie retains a lot of what makes IP Man a great martial art movie. The grounded, brutal yet fluid realistic fights are still there and are still great as always. The fluid interplay between contrasting martial arts are still great. Donnie Yen continues giving a wised yet graceful performance as the titular character with an elegant yet ferocious fighting style. Additionally, the last 15-20 minutes of this movie is very thrilling and also a very satisfying conclusion to the legacy of this franchise. In the end, this movie still provides fans with what made them fall in love with this franchise in the first place and sticking to its strengths still makes for a very good time.… Expand            "

E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 8Ip Man film series is finally coming to an end with the fourth and final instalment. True to the movie title, it is also the final time for Donnie Yen to reprise the role of the legendary Wing Chun grandmaster.In the year of 1964, Ip Man (Yen) learnt that he has a throat cancer due to many years of smoking. Life is not easy for him after his wife passed away because he has a strained relationship with with younger son, Ip Ching, whom he disapproved of his son wanting to be a martial artist like him. After Ip Ching got expelled from school for fighting against a bully, Ip Man decides to travel to San Francisco, California to find a school for his son.Around the same time, he receives an invitation from his student, Bruce Lee, to attend a karate tournament in the same place as well. He also finds out from Master Wan (Yue), the president of Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association that Bruce Lee have taught martial arts to the Americans and they are totally against it. The association offers to write a referral letter for Ip Man to find a school for his son if he tells Bruce to stop teaching martial arts to Americans but he rejects the offer because he believes that his student is doing the right thing.Meanwhile in the Marines boot camp, Staff Sergeant Hartman Wu tried to convince Gunnery Sergeant Barton Geddes (Adkins) to incorporate Chinese martial arts into their hand-to-hand combat training but he refuse because he believed that the current karate training is superior. Hartman later managed to convince his commanding officer to let him do some research on Chinese martial arts in the upcoming Midsummer Festival. Not happy with the outcome, Barton gets Marines karate instructor, Colin Frater, to fight the Chinese martial artists at the festival.Just like the last three Ip Man movies, Ip Man 4: The Finale is amazing and heartwarming conclusion to series. Donnie Yen is really great and charismatic in his role. He never lost his touch on playing the role of the Wing Chun grandmaster. Scott Adkins is not bad either. He is really good in playing bad guys just like some of his similar roles in his previous movies. Adkins also did very great job in displaying his martial art skills and I really love the fight scene between him and Donnie Yen. Both of them gave each other the best fight on the big screen.However, there is a minor drawback on this movie. First of all, Bruce Lee didn't have many scenes just like in the third instalment. His relationship with Ip Man was not deeply explored which would have made the movie even greater and better. The good thing is I'm glad this movie still have him show off his fighting skills. Speaking of fighting, all of the fighting scenes are very well shot and executed. Kudos to Yuen Woo-ping for making the fighting scenes great.Finally, the storyline is simple to understand and easy to follow. It is nothing special or unique but it is still good enough and entertaining. The ending is very emotional and extremely sad. It's not because it is the final instalment but it also a fitting end to Donnie Yen's portrayal of Ip Man and the fate of the Wing Chun grandmaster at the end of the movie. I won't spoil it but I think you already know what it is. As for Donnie Yen and Wilson Yip, thank you for making Ip Man movies the greatest martial arts movies of all time.… Expand            "

It takes a look at the different people that have gathered there because they were either court martialed or stuck there. It is a realistic view of war, as some people are cowards and some are brave. And in contrast there are the people in the foreign district in Shanghai living it up and watching by. Later on, some of the character like Lao Tie and Lao Suan Pan develop comraderies through their struggle to not get killed, even though they were hostile to each other at first. And the emotional sacrifice some soldiers had to make to stop the Japanese really touched my heart. One of the best film of the year for me.… Expand            "

Second of all, how can people dare to say this is propaganda, when there are actual historic footages from that time still in historic archives depicting that event, recorded by journalists. And the movie didn't even portrayed the chinese soldiers having a victory, but it was a bloody retreat, as was described in history that is even recorded and known in western history books. And the soldiers weren't even communists, they were from NRA from Chiang Kaisheks army.Also the West, as in The League of Nations didn't lay a finger to help the chinese to fight fascism.It's a shame and disgrace of western cinemas not putting this movie in mainstream theaters and telling the story about  the brave sacrifice these chinese soldiers have made in trying to defend their dignity and country.… Expand            "

Except here actors were terrible - and I watched in their language with subs and still it felt terrible, especially the actors speaking English in movie.

The characters were creative and gave me all kinds of emotion, love, joy, anger, surprise, excited, over and over. The girl, Félicie, was not able to dance at first, but she had the love and passion, which already made her better then any of the kids at the dance school. All she needed was someone to teach her, someone who saw that raw passion, love, and talent for dancing. Her friend, victor, had dreams of his own and where they might not have been fulfilled, he was on the right path to becoming a great inventor and I loved it. Now Félicie had stolen the identity of a girl who had hopes of going to the dance school, she was spoiled and rude, but her mother was the source and was overall crazy. One thing I would want added to the movie is what happened to the mother of that spoiled girl at the end, even if it was in the credits. That aside I absolutely loved this movie. Leap was very inspiring, so much I thought of doing MY FIRST REVIEW EVER on it. Can't wait tell its on DVD, I might see it again before then because this is a movie worth watching over and over, bring joy to my heart.… Expand            "

That does not mean they lack behind in 3D format. The recent film 'The Little Prince' was theDreaming's easy, but chasing it needs all the effort.Well, I praise a lot, particularly the European animations for preserving the 2D animation. That does not mean they lack behind in 3D format. The recent film 'The Little Prince' was the perfect example of a quality 3D animation outside Hollywood. Pars with Disney, Pixar standards. Technically, as well as the story contents. But the quantities are very less and also making it a bit expensive. So they usually prefer producing it in the English language for the wider/international market, keeping North America particularly in mind. This is a French English-language film that co-produced by Canada.This is a nice film, that particularly targets little kids and mostly the girl audience to inspire Ballerina. Cute characters and scenes, but very familiar story. Shares lots of similarities with 'August Rush', except the field of interest. I am not an expert or know all about Ballet, but some of the parts involving them were turned me off. I know the gravitation force is irrelevant in animation since they're not real world to comply with science, but maybe I'm being an adult and knowing that stuff might have influenced me to think that way. It reminds me I'm really an adult, though this film should be watched as a kid despite whatever you are. However, nothing affected me from enjoying it.It sets in the 80s of the 19th century France. At the time when Eiffel Tower and Statue of Libery were on the construction, a poor orphan girl named Felicie escapes orphanage with another boy to pursue her dream to be a ballerina. Then they arrive in Paris, and very soon they find their separate ways to achieve the goals. Not all smooth sail, especially for her. So she takes the opportunity that comes her way, even after knowing it was wrong to do.❝You have something that she can only dream of: passion!❞From there, with all the complications tailing her, how far she could go to make her dream come true. Which also includes the amount of dedication put on her undertaking to meet the expectations of her trainer, rivals and many others. And to show the world the interest is not simply based on enthusiasm, but willingness to sacrifice anything for it. Her journey from nothing to the edge of something new to define her life is the film that briefs for just short of 90 minutes.This is not another 'Billy Elliot'. Animations are usually comedy, fantasy and musical, but recently the adventures and science fictions are surging. I don't remember I ever have seen an animated dance flick. Not the classical dance, not in the modern 3D animation format. The closest one was a decade old 'Happy Feet'. So that makes it is a unique product and comes under a must see for all the animation fans. But the storyline is predictable and many sequences were intentionally dragged to be cliché. Because it works, particularly if they're aiming for the younger generation who haven't seen many films in their lives. Only we the grownups whine.Most of the voice-over artists are well known Americans actors which boosted the film. The character combinations are good. It brought the variety, especially slightly to ride off the main theme in a few occasions. Like the boy's interest in inventing things which were other major parts of the twist and turns in the narration. It is not a great animation if it was from Hollywood, but coming from France and the theme it focused on, the effort must be appreciated. Overall a much better film than what the average reviews and ratings around the internet says. It is a ballet film means not those who love it should watch it, but those target audience should not miss it. That means generally worth a watch, but not for everyone.7/10… Expand            "

The original title in Canada - Ballerina - was a much better name.

It also is available for purchase on Amazon Canada at the same time it hit theaters, great for families that do not have a theater nearby to see this in.It's a simple movie with a simple plot. Rags to Riches, ballet style. Some of the scenes could have been done differently - there's been (valid) criticism about the romance element and (not as valid) criticism about a pub scene. The choice of using modern music in scenes helps keep younger ones interested - our school-age daughter keeps singing Sia's ""Suitcase"" because that's one of her favorite scenes. Yes, it would be nice to encourage more classical music - but this shouldn't replace the right way to show ballet. And there's only one way to do that - actually go and see them.All in all, when there are a lack of good (recent) movies for kids showing ballet this checks of all the right boxes. Worth $100 for family of 4 to go? Possibly. Worth $30 to buy it and keep it at home? Absolutely.… Expand            "

            Thank you, Devin. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Sorry, we’re a little delayed this month.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Fiscal 2021 was really a transformational year for Inotiv, reflecting our success. We expanded the existing operations and
            services, starting up new operations and services, acquiring strategic assets, raising capital, building really a very strong
            foundation for our future. And I’m very proud of the team and the results this quarter and this year.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            By broadening our suite of solutions and adding new talent to our team and achieving greater scale, we created an organization
            that more comprehensively supports our clients’ discovery and development objectives. Inotiv’s expanded platform also presents
            us with significant opportunities to cross sell solutions, drive revenue growth, and deliver improved operating margins. Inotiv
            rapidly transformed this past year, but one constant that has played a key role in our success is our client service oriented
            culture. I commend our growing team for the dedication to our customers, looking to constantly improve and for making the
            appropriate short-term decisions to ensure that we thrive over the long run.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            To recap some of this year’s notable milestones, I’ll start with the expansion of our existing operations and services. At West
            Lafayette, Indiana facility, we expanded vivarium capacity. In February, we received accreditation by the Association for
            Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. In St. Louis, we exercised our option to purchase the
            previously leased facility and have completed the first phase expansion of approximately 15,000 square feet, adding office,
            archives, and laboratory capacity. The St. Louis expansion gives us critical new technology and state-of-the-art laboratory
            capabilities to support our clients’ needs in DMPK, cell, molecular biology, pharmacology, toxicology, and histopathology,
            helping extend our reach into earlier stages of drug discovery.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            We opened the newly constructed scientific laboratories in November of this year. At our Fort Collins, Colorado facility, we
            invested more than $1 million over the last year to make improvements to expand capacity and broaden our services. It’s allowed
            us to more than double this business since it was acquired in November of 2019. In Evansville, Indiana, we recently initiated
            design planning for another expansion. We expect the design, build and validation process to take approximately 24 months.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            In Boulder, Colorado, we acquired three companies, have now increased leased space by an additional 19,000 square feet adjacent
            to our existing sites to support the additional strong demand queries we are receiving for discovery services.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            In Gaithersburg, Maryland, we invested in equipment and infrastructure to reduce bottlenecks and leased additional space. As a
            result, this business saw significant growth in the past 12 months has more than doubled, almost tripled its sales capacity,
            since its acquisition in 2019.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Among our internal startups this past fiscal year, we initiated the development of new in-house enterprise-wide technology
            solutions for data and study management, as an additional investment to help enhance the client experience. We also recruited
            notable industry experts to Inotiv, to help accelerate the startup of new services, further reducing our outsourcing cost and
            enhancing our ability to deliver services as a fully integrated service provider.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Examples include Dr. Adam Aulbach, who is spearheading our new veterinary clinical pathology offering, Dr. Kenneth Swart, who is
            leading the development of our analytical capabilities to support biologics, biomarkers, cell-based analysis and therapeutics.
            Dr. Nicolette Jackson is building out our medical device, histology and pathology solutions. Dr. Gopala Krishna is overseeing
            our entry into the genetic toxicology space. Ty Speece who is leading our Cardiovascular Safety Pharmacology business, and a
            team of experts to lead the development and growth and send data reporting or standard for the exchange of nonclinical data.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            These internal initiatives started to contribute to our underlying organic growth in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2021, we also
            significantly changed the complexion of Inotiv through strategic acquisitions, starting with the purchase of Boulder, Colorado
            based, HistoTox Labs, and Bolder BioPATH in April and May. HistoTox brought us strong expertise in tissue staining and
            quantitative image analysis, while Bolder BioPATH added depth to our existing pharmacology and pathology enterprise, allowing us
            to further extend our market reach in early stage drug discovery.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            These acquisitions now comprise our Boulder, Colorado operations, and together delivered strong fourth quarter performances for
            Inotiv, contributing approximately $7.1 million of combined revenue, corresponding to an annualized revenue run-rate of
            approximately $28.4 million.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Both companies’ corporate cultures have proven to be highly compatible with ours and each business has been integrating into
            Inotiv’s fold, performing ahead of our expectations. We’re starting to see these tangible cross-selling benefits from these
            acquisitions as well. For example, we had the opportunity to integrate bio analysis and pharmacokinetics, previously provided by
            legacy Inotiv sites to the non-clinical service offerings provided by legacy Bolder BioPATH. We expect to reap similar benefits
            from our acquisition of Colorado-based Plato BioPharma, which we completed after the quarter ended, which brings us
            complementary in vivo pharmacology platform that we are weaving into our Boulder discovery operations.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            In July, we acquired genetic toxicology assets from MilliporeSigma’s BioReliance portfolio, bolstering our efforts to develop
            in-house genetic toxicology capabilities. And we purchased first-class laboratory equipment and instrumentation, stock,
            consumables, bench work from a Tennessee-based lab services provider that seized operations, advancing our efforts to build
            in-house biotherapeutic solutions.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            We recently signed a lease on our facility in Rockville, Maryland, and have initiated recruiting efforts to build the scientific
            and laboratory staff necessary to support this effort. In August, we acquired Missouri-based Gateway Pharmacology, which
            enhances our expertise in cardiovascular and renal pharmacology. Gateway Pharmacology dovetails well with our expanded St. Louis
            facilities, strategically positioning us for additional synergies.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Finally, in September, we announced an agreement to purchase Envigo, a leading global provider of research models and services.
            The Envigo transaction closed after quarter-end, so do not contribute to our fourth quarter financial results. That said, we are
            very pleased about how well the two organizations are coming together. From a financial perspective, we expect the Envigo
            acquisition to be accretive to Inotiv’s EBITDA margins and earnings in the quarters to come. In Envigo, we have secured access
            to high quality research models for the pre-clinical services offered by Inotiv and needed by our clients. This acquisition was
            once again a result of listening to and addressing our customers’ concerns.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Reflecting Envigo’s deep animal husbandry expertise and services, 17 of its top-20 clients have been repeat customers for more
            than a decade. These incredibly durable customer relationships have supported 99% plus revenue retention rates at Envigo and
            will benefit our combined organization in the years to come. Moreover, we have identified excellent cross selling opportunities
            with Envigo’s global base of more than 2,550 clients. Clearly, Envigo brings us additional scale and expands our footprint in
            attractive new geographies such as the European market. Finally, and importantly, we benefit from an injection of additional
            talent.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Our strong fourth quarter fiscal 2021 financial results reflect the successful execution of our strategic growth plan with
            revenue nearly doubling year-over-year to $30.1 million, driven by approximately 47% internal growth and 53% external growth.
            Our adjusted EBITDA increased to $4.3 million from $156,000 during the same time period, demonstrating the underlying leverage
            in our business as we scale.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            As I noted earlier, in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal 2021, we continue to make significant investments in our
            business through acquisitions, internal expansion and embedded operational startups. Simultaneously, across our organization, we
            have continued to make broad expansion investments in G&amp;A, including our people, infrastructure, systems and services. While
            our operating margins were temporarily depressed in the fourth quarter, due to this growth oriented investments, we expect
            enhanced future growth and margins over the long run.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            We’re pulling several levers to improve longer term profitability, including making scalable investments continuing to reduce
            outsourcing by bringing key capabilities in house, driving cross-selling initiatives, taking advantage of purchasing
            opportunities, lowering client acquisition costs as a percent of revenue, leveraging existing direct fixed costs and reducing
            corporate overhead as a percentage of revenue. In the fourth quarter, adjusted unallocated corporate G&amp;A was approximately

            quarter of fiscal 2021. We intend to restate our historical financial results for the third quarter, making certain non-cash
            adjustments to increase the amount of Goodwill and deferred tax liability recorded on the June 30, 2021 balance sheet by
            approximately $4.9 million, and to reduce our valuation allowance recorded on the June 30, 2021 balance sheet, while increasing

            The Bolder BioPATH and HistoTox acquisitions closed in may. So, our sales cycle, it probably -- what we did in May is -- I think
            what happened this quarter was in process well before we did in May. I think some of the results this quarter and some of the
            book-to-bill this quarter were things that had been in process 12 to 18 months and things we’ve been putting in place over the
            last 12 months. This is not in the last four to five months. That being said, we may have had some short-term gains from some of
            the Bolder and HistoTox clients. But, I think it’s more of an indication of a very strong demand, our ability to open up some
            capacity, our plan to open up further capacity, and existing customers continue to expand the amount of work that they placed
            with us.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            I think that some of what Bolder BioPATH and the integration Bolder BioPATH and HistoTox are things that are going to continue
            to drive us in the future. But I doubt if we saw as much in the last quarter, because I know we closed those in May and I think
            some of those things that would close last quarter wouldn’t have been -- the larger projects would have been quoted in June and
            issued that quickly.

            There has been I think some inflation, over the summer, we saw obviously wage inflation take place that we addressed proactively
            and try to address quickly, as we saw it taking place, that we have tried to pass through some of that. That being said,
            certainly -- much of the results we had in Q4 were jobs that were quoted well before that inflationary period. I think it will
            -- it probably -- some inflation is obviously and some price increases definitely in the backlog as we look out. But we’re
            looking at a six to nine-month backlog, so not all of it would be in there, but there’s going to be some inflationary pressures
            resolve some of the price increases we saw -- I think we’ve been able to pass through over the last three or four months.

            Well, I think, we have been aggressive in trying to address our ability to move our Company forward to prepare the Company
            that’s going to be the best Company in 2024 and 2025, and leading drug discovery and development. And we’ve also been
            very-disciplined in how we view use of our capital. As long as we can continue to find really good returns and which we’ve been
            able to on some of the capital we’ve invested, we don’t need to see it right away, but as long as we can see long-term good
            returns, we’re going to continue to be aggressive in investing. We succeeded with that strategy, I believe, in our discovery and
            safety assessment business at Inotiv. And with Envigo, I believe that they probably have not invested as aggressively as we have
            in the past. And so, I think that there are some low lying opportunities for some investments that can drive some pretty strong
            returns at Envigo in the future. So, I think we’ll be very-disciplined, but we’re looking forward to making some of those
            investments, and they’re making some of them now as we speak, some are deferred maintenance issues, but a lot of them have very
            strong returns.

            Got it. I appreciate it. And then just lastly, how are you looking at new M&amp;A targets? Obviously you had a very productive
            year for M&amp;A. Are you looking to drive scale via geography? Are there other service areas that you think you can bring in
            house? And then, at what point does it make sense to evaluate clinical services, not preclinical, it’s still a little early, but
            just kind of curious about your thoughts there? Thank you.

          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Right now, we are focused on the preclinical market. We are not focused on clinical services, although we do have some clients
            that ask us to do some clinical bioanalytical work, that’s a small percent of our overall revenue, and we’ve not really focused
            on the pre -- on the clinical market, and nor are we doing that day. I won’t say never, but we are not doing it currently.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            As far as preclinical, we -- I think what’s been key to our strategy has been scale. And you can see our existing sites, the
            ones that we bought, the important sort of we’ve talked about all of them doubling and tripling in size and that scale has
            bought significant enhanced margins as we leveraged through our costs. So, we’ll continue to look for opportunities that provide
            scale. And we’ve obviously been aggressive in acquiring services. And now, I think we’re -- we could even consider looking at
            opportunities to drive market share. So, it’s something that we’ve done quite a bit in our early years. We took year 2019 and
            ‘20, we took about 12 months as we really focused on our infrastructure, but we’ve become much stronger I think. And I believe
            that -- I think the synergies that we can see from future acquisitions are probably much greater than they’ve ever been before.

          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Thank you for taking the questions. And what an amazing year! You guys accomplished a ton. Just a few questions. First off,
            regarding the integrations, and you spoke to this a little bit. But, I’m curious, as you look at those integrations, is the
            primary benefit going to come via margin expansion, or do you see a better or more important aspect of those integrations in the
            level of service and the quality and timing of responses back to the customers? Is that the bigger opportunity within those
            integrations?
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            It’s been all the above. The acquisitions we’ve looked at, we’ve looked at improving margins from growing the acquisitions and
            how can we invest in the companies that we’ve acquired to bring the scale and growth opportunities and being able to grow. Then,
            we also acquire clients, when we acquire the services. And we buy a lot of companies that are single service oriented. And now,
            we have all IND-enabling services under one roof. So, we’re able to take those clients and sell them all of our services, and
            that has helped grow our overall sales. And there’s a lot of our internal growth as we sell the clients we are acquiring all of
            our services. And then, very importantly, when we have scaled up and started new services or we acquire services, we inevitably
            then are -- we don’t have to outsource as much, our client doesn’t have to go through a third party. And when we can do that, we
            can control the timing much better, and we can help accelerate the speed at which they can do their discovery and development
            work. So, all three of those things are critical when we evaluate acquisitions.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            In addition, we’re always very interested in obtaining talent. But, when we look at acquisitions, it’s important that we can see
            the opportunity that we can scale. We want to be able to add value to what we are buying. And then, in addition, we look at how
            they can add value to our current customers and our other services, and that formula has worked extremely well for us. And I
            hope it to continue too in the future.

            Separately, I’m just curious, and I realize it’s very early days. But regarding Envigo and some of the cross-selling
            opportunities there, what has been the initial response or feedback that you’ve been getting from some of their customers? Do
            you have anything anecdotally that you could point to as far as some initial wins on the cross-selling side?

            We’ve had clients come to us now with the services that we have and ask us to quote, participate in their services and quoting
            their services. I don’t have a numeric number for you -- number for you that can tell you how much that has been so far. But
            we’re only four or five weeks into this. And we have, as you can see, a very robust backlog. At this point -- at times, we have
            actually no quoting jobs. We’ve had so much activity. Our quoting level has ramped up significantly.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            I would tell you, in the last four to five weeks, we have more than doubled our client service group that is handling the
            quotes. So, we have a significant amount of activity and -- that’s a great opportunity, great problem for us to have. And I’m
            really pleased that we’ve been able to retain some very talented people that have been able to grow that. But for us, we want to
            be really client service oriented and that means even returning timely, if somebody asks you to quote, and we’re ramping that up
            quickly to take advantage of all the opportunities that are coming to us at the moment. But, I don’t have any numeric, not
            anything for you right now that I can tell you what -- depending on what that is?

            And that anecdotally is fine. I realize it’s early days. One last one from me, regarding you just touched on it a little bit
            there, but I think on the Envigo acquisition call that you hosted, you talked about one of the primary areas that you plan to
            invest in one of the things that you think can continue to help you differentiate from peers is your quality of service, and to
            do that, you have to maintain the right level of employees. I’m curious how has the hiring proceeded? Are you having success?
            And are there some areas that need a little bit more from a headcount perspective to meet your internal targets? Thank you.

          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Hiring, over the last three or four years at any one time, we’ve had, if we have 500 people, I’ve noticed we have 50 openings;
            if we have 1,000 people, we have 100 openings. Today, we have 1,800 to 1,900 people, we probably have 200 openings. Hiring in
            this market for our company, for any company and retention is hugely important. We’ve been very aggressive in our hiring and we
            will continue to be. I’m pleased with our ability to recruit. I think, the Envigo and some of the things we’ve done in the last
            year and adding services, we’ve got some great talent, and that talent’s been able to recruit additional talent. And it’s very
            rewarding when we even now get calls, people calling us, wanting one to be part of Inotiv for what we’re doing.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            So, that being said, we’re always onboarding people. We’re always looking for people. And matter of fact that the phone call was
            on for 30, 40 minutes before we had this call, today. It was all about what we’re doing to enhance our ability to recruit,
            retain, and train our people. And there’s a high degree of awareness in our company and we have time spend on that. It’s a
            critical resource for us. But we are -- if we’re going to continue to grow and you see our backlog and you can see our
            book-to-bill, if we’re going to continue to grow, and we have a very aggressive infrastructure build out and capital plan for
            next year, it’s going to require people and we’re going to need to be very aggressive and try to recruit those people to market
            -- from the market to our company.

            Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Hi, Bob. In prior conversations, as a little bit of a follow-up to Matt’s
            question, but you had talked about kind of needing to have capacity in place before you thought you could really turn the sales
            force loose on the cross-selling opportunities that Envigo presents. And I thought that that capacity might have been a little
            bit physical capacity, but certainly was also that client service element that Matt touched on. Can you talk about -- you
            mentioned that you doubled that group. Can you give -- zoom out a little bit and give a little bit of a perspective on kind of
            where you stand on capacity and your ability to kind of go full steam ahead against the opportunities that Envigo presents?
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            <strong><span class="answer">Bob Leasure</span></strong>
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Hi, Dave, and I’ll try to -- when we reported last quarter, we had $23 million or $24 million, and this quarter is $30 million,
            20% growth. That’s fairly large in one quarter. If you’d asked me last quarter at this time, did we have the ability to do $30
            million in sales? I probably would not have given that $30 million as it was even a capacity. So, I’m very pleased by how fast
            we are able to bring on capacity.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            That being said, I think, what we saw last quarter was what we could do. I would -- I couldn’t have asked them to do much more.
            That’s pretty good growth in one quarter for a service oriented business that we’re in.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            That being said, we are -- today, I outlined we have got a lot of brick-and-mortar coming on board with leases that we’ve just
            recently incurred, I think entered into, I think, in Rockville and [Indiscernible] Boulder. I would tell you that we’re looking
            at leasing additional space and a further expansion, major expansion at Fort Collins. We’re looking at buying a property,
            possibly in Maryland, and we’re looking at acquisitions in some acquisitions that hopefully they even have capacity.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            So, we’re going to probably continue to be very aggressive and ramping up that capacity. But, what we saw last quarter was
            probably about what I think we could have done with people we have. I think if you look back and look at our sales per person,
            so another good indication, we’re now achieving over 200,000 sales per person. If you go back a couple of years, we were
            140,000, which gave you an idea we had a lot of capacity left. When we start going up to 200,000 and well over 200,000, 220,000
            and 230,000 then we’re starting to use up a lot of that capacity that we were sitting on.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            So, we will open up more capacity this quarter. We’ll open up again next quarter, some more, and some of the new services are
            growing quickly. But I can’t really tell you that we can -- it’s not like we’re going to all of a sudden our capacity. Moving
            20% a quarter is pretty -- we could do 10, but I’m not sure I would sit here and tell you 20% a quarter to open up is possible.
            But, with acquisitions and some of the things we’re doing, we’ve got some great opportunities. I will put it that way.

          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Excellent. I appreciate that answer. Another topic here around, again, this has been touched on a little bit around
            cross-selling. And you mentioned what I was going to touch on in IND-enabling capabilities and having all of those in-house. And
            it does seem like a level of your cross-sell is to not have to outsource or not have to send a client to other vendors for
            services that would be part of a study package. And then, the next level of out of cross-selling might be capturing the client
            in some of your discovery businesses and pulling those through into some of your safety businesses. Are you able to do both of
            those now, or is one the predominant kind of level of discussion with the client at this point?
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            <strong><span class="answer">Bob Leasure</span></strong>
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            We were able to do both of those. And I’d also say, we’re seeing some of our safety and assessment customers now moving some of
            their discovery work to us. So, it’s happening across the board. But, I’ll give you an example. We opened up SEND data
            reporting. SEND data reporting, if we were outsourcing it, we may be quoted 12 weeks, and we don’t make a lot of margin on that
            -- outsourcing that. If we move now and a client now has a need to move quickly, we can get that down to four weeks or less.
            That’s taking a lot of time just out of that one segment -- just out of that reporting, that was critical. Same when we did
            safety pharmacology. So, all of these things are significant benefits to our clients.
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            And I would say that the acquisitions we’ve done and the services brought in are all really specifically listening to our
            clients. When I got here four years ago, it was going to be about returning a phone call. It was listening to our clients. All
            of our things we’re building in-house are listening to clients and their concerns about our time. And I think that our team has
            done a good job of building, in some cases even much faster than I thought. I think we saw revenue from a lot of the startups we
            did that and we’ve not seen any revenue yet from our genetic toxicology startup that we’re doing, but we could see some of that
            here in this quarter. And we’ll see, I think more next quarter. So, these services are really ramping up and we’re -- not only
            are they ramping up, we’re already expanding and growing them.

          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Last question for me around the labor inflation that you touched on, is that -- is your ability to price that through pretty
            real time, or is there a lag to like an annual repricing of rate cards and things like that?
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            <strong><span class="answer">Bob Leasure</span></strong>
          </p>
          <p class="paywall-full-content">
            Well, we have been able to I think pass on pretty real time versus making sure that we real-time increase the wages, because
            there was a lot of pressure there over the summer for entry level wages in particular. We can pass them on real time, and the
            client’s very understanding. But when they’re sitting on a 6- to 8-month backlog, that backlog is already priced at maybe a
            previous rate. So, what we’re closing today is closed at the increased pricing. At one point last year, and even today, we --
            for some research models, we were very careful to do actually not even lock in a price. It was almost like it was going to be
            very real, like it’s new market pricing at the time this study is placed, because some of the costs of the research models were
            going up so quickly, specifically nonhuman primates. So, we tried to do what we could to make sure we could protect our ability
            to pass through those costs.
